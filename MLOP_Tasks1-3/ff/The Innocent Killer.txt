didn't attack Konoha because someone killed his mate or kit, he's
a demon lord. He can do what ever the fuck he wants; he doesn't
need a fucking explanation. Can pretty little innocent Naru-chan fall
in love with a cold blooded murderer? Why am I asking such an obvious
question?</p><P>§§§§§</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>

can write one without dieing from blood loss)!</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Kyuubi grumbled. He
rested his big head on his front paws and glared at the gate in front
of him. That stupid mortal had dared seal him, the King of Hell, in a
useless human child! His tails twitched in annoyance.</p><P>"<B>Stupid blond
monkey sealing me in such a defenseless stupid blond mini-monkey…"</B>
Kyuubi muttered under his breath. He knew he was acting childish, but
no-one was around to see him so it didn't really matter.</p><P>He had already stopped
trying to break out, that dammed piece of paper was stronger than it
looked. The big fox sighed, and then he grinned as he thought of
something. Now that he was here he might as well try to make the most
of it.</p><P>'<I><B>Okey, I refuse
to be stuck in an ugly and weak container, so I'll have to make
sure my container is neither.' </B></I>The red fox thought as he
scanned the kids' genes. He did not like what he saw.</p><P>Kyuubi had an obsession
with beauty, so he thought he'd make the brat he was stuck in
beautiful. He also had an obsession with strength, but that didn't
matter now, the kid was only one month old.</p><P>And so, he amused
himself for a while by altering the genes of the defenseless,
not-so-blond-anymore, mini-monkey.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Sarutobi sighed in
distress. Here he was, again, in the position he'd so gladly given
up to Arashi-kun. And now he was buried in the
paper-work-of-independent-doom. Again. How on earth Arashi-kun was
finished before lunch everyday was, and would stay, a mystery to him.
To escape every Kages' arch enemy he decided to go visit young
Naruto.</p><P>He walked out of his
office and went to the room just next to it.</p><P>The old man smiled down
at the sleeping blond. He was such an angelic child. Quiet and very
cute. But as the man watched, with wide disbelieving eyes, the
appearance of little Naruto began to change.</p><P>His hair, that almost
had to be considered a neon colure before, darkened and became light
brown, with dark-blond highlights. His face changed and became more
oval-shaped, his cheekbones higher, his nose transformed into a cute
button nose, his lips became a tiny bit fuller and his eyes a bit
bigger. The baby-boys lashes thickened, lengthened and darkened, his,
a bit thick, fingers transformed into long and slender ones and even
his neck lengthened.</p><P>The boys body didn't
change that much, but Sarutobi assumed that it will not develop into
what it should have been developing into.</p><P>The old man smiled
again. He was certain this was the Kyuubis work, and he almost wanted
to thank it. This would make it so much easier to keep the baby's
parentage a secret.</p><P>The boy opened his big,
sparkling blue eyes, and laughed as he saw the Sandime sand over him.
And if Sarutobi didn't know better he would say this was a little,
very beautiful, girl.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P><B>Time skip; 8 years
later</B></p><P>§§§§§</p><P>"Oji-chan, oji-chan!"
A young boy called as he dashed through the doors to Sarutobi's
office. The old man looked up and smiled.</p><P>"Yes Naruto-kun? What
is it?" he asked and put the pen away, secretly thanking whatever
god was out there for the interruption. The boy eyes were almost
shining with happiness and Sarutobi knew he'd never be able to deny
Naruto whatever it was he'd ask for.</p><P>"I want to start the
ninja academy!" Sarutobi smiled, he knew this day would come sooner
or later. He looked at Naruto. The boy had grown to be more beautiful
than most girls would never even hope to be. His silky, light-brown
hair was tied in a high pony-tail and his whisker-marks on his cheeks
made them seem even more defined than they already were. Anyone who
didn't know him would say that Naruto was definitely, without a
single doubt, a girl. Sarutobi sighed.</p><P>"Alright, Naruto-kun
I'll enroll you into the academy." He said and began looking
through the ridiculously high paper mountains.</p><P>"YAY!!" Naruto
cheered and started jumping around. The Hokage smiled a bit and then
concentrated fully on finding the paper he needed.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Naruto was positively
giddy and was bouncing of the walls. He'd get
to enter the ninja academy! Then a Chunin ninja came in, and all
happy feelings went out the window. The Chunin sneered at him and
glared. Naruto backed into a corner of the room and tried to make
himself as small as possible. The man put some more paper down on
Sarutobi's desk.</p><P>"Honestly,
Hokage-sama!" he said as said Hokage resurfaced with a paper in
hand. "Why do continue to let the demon-brat," at that word he
turned to glare at Naruto even more viciously than before, "come in
here! You should just ki…" He didn't have the time to finish as
he was thrown into the opposite wall hard enough to crack it.</p><P>"Say
something like that one more time, and I'll personally rip your
tongue out and feed it to you! Then perhaps you could spend some
quality time with Ibiki!" The Hokage was leaking killer intent and
the frightened Chunin picked himself of the floor and ran out.</p><P>Naruto looked at
Sarutobi with something close to awe.</p><P>"Wow,
oji-chan! That's so cool! Do you think I'll learn that when I'm
a ninja? How did you do it? I never thought you were so strong!"
Sandime smiled at the energetic brunette in front of him.</p><P>"Now, now,
Naruto-kun. Calm down." Naruto took a deep breath and steeled down
in one of the chairs in front of the desk, filled with paper.</p><P>"Ne, ne, when can I
begin?" He asked and was obviously trying hard to sit still. The
old man looked at the paper in his hand and started writing something
on it. Then he looked up again.</p><P>"I'll take you
there tomorrow, and introduce you to the class. Iruka-sensei has a
free spot left in his class." Naruto looked up at the Hokage with
his big, shining, blue eyes and smiled. He looked like an angel,
Sarutobi thought. Then Naruto bounced out of the chair and ran out of
his office.</p><P>'<I>Oh well, back to
work.' </I>He sighed and looked at the piles and endless piles of
paper. He started crying chibi tears and thought; <I>'Oh good
Kami-sama, why me?'</I></p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Naruto was skipping
merrily along the main street of Konoha. He was very happy, and was
showing it to everyone. The villagers sneered and yelled insults
after him but he paid them no heed. One woman smiled a bit at him and
he beamed at her, and everyone around her stared at the angelic
creature. Some of them even had to rethink the idea of that beautiful
boy being a demon. How can something so pure and innocent be evil?</p><P>When Naruto came home
he immediately started to make himself some instant ramen. And while
he ate he thought of how it was going to be in the first day of
class. He smiled and fantasized about learning jutsus and how to
control that blue and red thing that leaked out of him sometimes when
he was angry.</p><P>When it was time for
him to go to sleep he continued his fantasies of being Hokage as soon
as he graduated in his dreams.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Iruka took a deep
breath and tried to calm himself. His class was a handful, and not
only that, but all the girls were constantly fighting over Sasuke.</p><P>"OKEY BRATS!! SETTLE
DOWN, NOW!!" He yelled, but they paid him no heed. He sighed and
looked down on his desk in frustration. And then he saw the letter
Hokage-sama had given him yesterday, and a light blubb went on in his
head.</p><P>"What will the new
kid think of this class when he sees it?" He said in normal
conversation tone. And his class went completely silent. You could
probably hear a pin drop. Iruka grinned, it worked!</p><P>Sakura, the pink-haired
girl rose from her seat that she had just a moment ago tried to
defend with her life, she sat next to Sasuke.</p><P>"What do you mean
sensei?" she asked, sounding confused. Iruka grinned again.</p><P>"I mean, we have a
new student today. And he's due in only a couple of minutes." And
instantly everyone went back to their place. As if on cue there was a
knock in the door. Iruka went to open it and his students leaned
forward to get a better look.</p><P>"Welcome
Hokage-sama!" he said and let the Hokage into the room. Sarutobi
smiled and nodded in acknowledgement.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Sasuke stared at the
girl that followed Sarutobi into the room. Even if she was only eight
she was one of the most beautiful girls he'd ever seen. Her clothes
was a bit boyish, black long pants with many pockets, a tight green
shirt and the standard black shinobi sandals, but they went perfectly
with her flawless honey-colored skin and silky light-brown hair.</p><P>"I'm sorry
Hokage-sama, but I was informed that she was a boy." Iruka said and
looked at the Hokage. Sandime chuckled and looked at the girl, who
looked like she was about to explode. No wonder, to be called a boy
when you were so obviously a girl.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>'<I>Oh no!
Competition!'</I> Sakura thought horrified. The girl was very
beautiful, far prettier than even Ino. She glanced at Sasuke and saw
how interested he looked. She gasped and looked back at the girl in
the doorway. She had closed her eyes now, still looking pissed, and
with the light that was flowing in the room through the big windows
and hitting her face, she truly looked like an angel.</p><P>Then she opened her
eyes that were so blue the sky looked like a mockery of their beauty
and looked straight at Iruka-sensei.</p><P>"I <I>am</I> a boy."</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>The class went
completely silent again. They stared at the boy. Then a blond
kunoichi said something.</p><P>"You're what?"
she asked quite rudely. Naruto stared at her with a look in his eyes
that clearly said; 'are you dumb?'</p><P>"I. Am. A. Boy." He
said, and it sounded like he talked to a baby. This of course, made
Ino very angry, she turned red in her face and was about to shout
something at him, when the Hokage stepped in.</p><P>"Hello class. This is
Uzumaki Naruto and he'll start the ninja academy today. Be nice to
each other." He turned to look at Naruto while he said this, "Got
that Naruto. Be nice." He said sternly.</p><P>"I'm always nice!"
he said with big, innocent, honest eyes, that no-one believed.</p><P>Sarutobi looked at
Naruto that so clearly said; 'you keep telling yourself that.'
Naruto laughed a bit, his laughter was sharp, like shattered glass,
but at the same time beautiful, like small bells ringing. The thought
of every male, except Sarutobi, was along the lines of; <I>'Oh, my,
god. He's so cute! I think I'm in love!'</I> And yes, even
Iruka-sensei. Though he tried to convince himself he was <I>not</I>,
under any circumstances, a pedophile, he had a very hard time doing
so.</p><P>"Ehem… Well then,
Naruto-kun, please take a seat." Iruka said, almost stuttering, and
still blushing furiously. Sandime saw his of course and chuckled in
his head at the teacher as he went back to that deeded paper-work.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Okey, probably not the
best I've ever done, but it'll get better!! I hope… There will
be yaoi in the next chapter, just so you know. And one more thing, I
completely <B>suck</B> at updating. But I'm trying, I swear! Flames
will be given to Gai and Lee.</p><P>Ja!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
WEEE!!! Next chappie. I'm sorry that I'm so late on updating this
chapter, but, life got in the way, as it tends to! I also want to
warn you that there will be a group-rape in this chapter. Poor, poor
Naru-chan. Oh well, it's necessary.</p><P><B>Yuri-chan: </B>Jepp,
I feel bad for Naruto-chan too, but as Yura-chan said, it's
necessary.</p><P><B>Yura-chan:
</B>Now then,TO THE BAT-MOBILE!!!</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:
</B>YURA-CHAN! Please be serious! You
made them wait this long already, so stop goofing around!</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
Ehehe, sorry Yuri-chan, I've just always wanted to say that, ON
WITH THE STORY!!!</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:</B>
'sigh'</p><P>§§§§§</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B>
Sooo not gonna say this again. If you want to see my disclaimer, go
to chapter one.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Naruto was skipping
happily back to the academy, he forgot his homework and had to go
back to get it.</p><P>The brunette had been
in the academy for three years now, (meaning he's eleven, he
started one year later than everyone else) and he was at the absolute
bottom. That didn't bother him in the least.</p><P>The academy-building
was in sight now and the Kyuubi-container started running. Naruto was
fast, actually he was very fast. He was faster than even Iruka-sensei
when they raced to the ramen-stand. This was one more thing Kyuubi
had made sure of.</p><P>The cute little boy
opened the sliding door to his classroom. No-one was there. Naruto
sighed, no-one to ask then. It was obvious that it wasn't on his
desk so he started to look in the boxes of the desk and on the floor.
Again he sighed, when it became obvious that his homework was nowhere
in the room.</p><P>'<I>Crap, and it's
due to tomorrow! Damnit!' </I></p><P>He plopped down on the
floor and shut his eyes tightly.</p><P>'<I>I can't think
of anywhere else to look. Hmm, wonder if Iruka-sensei'll buy me
ramen today… NO! Focus!' </I>He thought.</p><P>'<I>I'll just go
and ask a teacher if they've found it.'</I> The brunette decided
after a while of thought. Satisfied he rose to his feet and hoped of.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>"Hello?" Naruto
asked timidly as he opened the sliding door to the personnel room.
There were only three men left, as all the other teachers had gone
home for the day or received a mission.</p><P>"Um, have anyone
brought a homework from classroom 3-F here?" He asked in a silent
voice. The men shared a look, the kid was cute beyond measurements,
and it was the Kyuubi-brat. No-one would miss him if he didn't come
home, and no-one would believe a word the brat said.</p><P>"Yeah kid, it's
over here. Come on!" The man in the furthest back said. Naruto
sighed in relief and walked over to him. He saw the book lying on the
desk and reached for it while thanking the short man. But just as he
was about to retreat his hand the man grabbed it.</p><P>"Now, wouldn't it
be appropriate to give me a reward as I was the one who found it?"
he asked and leered at Naruto. The grip he had on the young boys arm
was starting to hurt.</p><P>"Um, w-what would
y-you want, t-then?" Naruto stuttered out. The other men leered at
him too, now.</p><P>"You." One of the
others said, and Narutos' eyes widened in realization. He tried to
pull away and succeeded to get away from man no.1 but as he turned
around to run one of the other two grabbed him around his waist.</p><P>"N-no! Please, I'll
give you anything! Please!" he pleaded as the man who had caught
him lifted him up on a nearby desk. They just laughed, and proceeded
to undress the little boy.</p><P>One of the men started
to unbuckle his belt and Narutos' pleading became louder. He
trashed against the hands holding him but they were stronger.</p><P>He screamed as the man
entered him. It felt like he was being ripped in two. Salty tears
leaked from his eyes, and unknown to all of them, Kyuubi awoke from
his nap and started to growl. For one reason or another, the King of
Hell was very protective of the kid. But there was nothing he could
do but try to lessen the pain Naruto was in and be prepared to heal
him after the despicable hairless monkeys were done.</p><P>The teacher thrusted in
and out of the little body and got some sort of sick pleasure out of
watching the boy scream and cry in pain.</p><P>When the first man was
'done', they swapped places, and the second man pulled down his
pants. Naruto were too tired and in too much pain to notice, so it
came as a real shock to his system when he was intruded upon again.
Once again he cried out in pain as he was entered.</p><P>He trashed
half-heartedly against his captors to no avail. And when the man
finally came inside of him, he was too tired to even sob. They
switched places again. And, again, Naruto was intruded upon. This
time he sank into blissful unconsciousness from the pain.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>When the small boy woke
up he was in some kind of sewer with pipes and a very dim lighting.
Surprised, he looked around. This was nowhere in Konoha, that was for
sure. He started walking and eventually came to a bright red door.
The door was huge, but as Naruto tried to push it open, he found that
it was ridiculously easy to do so. He entered an enormous room with
stone walls and water on the floor. In front of him there was a gate,
easily five times the size of the Hokage monument, and halfway up the
gate there was a small piece of paper with the kanji for seal.</p><P>Naruto was so amazed by
the size of the room and the gate that he didn't notice the big
glowing red eyes that were watching him with a sad look in them.</p><P>"<B>Hello kit."</B>
Someone said and Naruto screamed in fright as he finally saw the
eyes.</p><P>"W-w-who a-are
y-yo-you?" he asked, completely terrified.</p><P>"<B>I am the mighty
Kyuubi no Kitsune, King of Hell."</B> He said, and stared down on
the small form he viewed as beneath him.</p><P>"K-K-Kyuubi no
Kitsune?"</p><P>A surge of amusement
went trough the fox's eyes.</p><P>"<B>Yes foolish
mortal, Kyuubi."</B> He said in a slightly annoyed tone.</p><P>Kyuubi lowered his head
until it was lying on the wet ground of his prison. The boy had
turned out to be a beauty, just like he wanted it. The honest blue
eyes stared at him in awe and terror and Kyuubi felt himself once
again feel the urge to protect him from everything that would be even
slightly dangerous in the outside world. His hate for the three men
intensified. How dare they do such despicable things to the container
of the King of Hell?! They should treat royalty with more respect!
And he's a child! Not even yokai treated children in such a way!</p><P>'<I><B>Strange. This
feeling of protectiveness is only felt for our mates, not even our
kits can inspire </B></I><I><U><B>this</B></U></I><I><B> kind of
protectiveness. But surely I can't be thinking of him as mine,
could I?' </B></I>The mighty fox asked himself. He shook his head
to get rid of the confusing thoughts. The King of Hell is <I>never
</I>confused. <I>Ever.</I></p><P>He grinned, an evil
glint entered his eyes and he straightened is neck again.</p><P>"<B>Welcome, my
jailor, to my prison. This sewer we're standing in is your mind. I
am sealed in here until my powers return, or until you die."</B> He
said and looked down on the child.</p><P>Naruto's eyes
widened. 'My jailor'? He mouthed and stared up at the fox.</p><P>"'My jailor'?"
he said again, this time out loud. The fox threw his head back and
laughed.</p><P>Naruto felt a wave of
pleasure run up and down his spine as the Kyuubi laughed. Even his
laughter and voice were permeated with power
and absolute self-esteem. He made the Hokage seam weak willed and
about as powerful as a baby. No wonder Kyuubi was the leader of the
nine bijou. He could probably order someone stronger than him around,
and they would still listen.</p><P>"<B>Yes
mortal child, jailor. You are my prison and I, your prisoner. This is
my prison and will continue to be so until you die, or until my
entire power has returned to me. What you feel now isn't even a
thousand of my actual capacity."</B>
The Kyuubi explained again. He doubted the kit had heard him when he
explained it the first time.</p><P>The boy stared
wide-eyed at the fox eyes as it was all he could really see.</p><P>"Not
even a thousand?" He just couldn't wrap his mind around the
concept of that much power. It could put mind-bogglers on anyone.</p><P>The
fox, which saw that the boy was becoming dizzy trying to understand
how much power it was, changed the subject.</p><P>"<B>Aren't
you going to scream at me for not being dead and all that crap your
sensei tried to teach you?"</B> he
asked, in an extremely bored voice.</p><P>"Huh?
Oh, yeah! How <I>can</I>
you be alive after the fourth killed you? And how come you're
inside my head? And why am I here, by the way?"</p><P>The Kyuubi sighed in
annoyance.</p><P>"<B>That
blond monkey didn't kill me; I can't be killed, by humans and
demons alike. No, he sealed me into a new borne baby. You."</B></p><P>Narutos mouth formed a
perfect 'o' as he tried to melt the information. And then it hit
him.</p><P>"Wait,
what? You can't die? As in immortal or invulnerable?" He asked
with obvious awe.</p><P>The
Kyuubi chucked and Naruto felt pleasure shoot down his spine again.</p><P>"<B>Yes,
child, I am immortal or invulnerable, whatever floats your boat."</B>
Kyuubi said and shrugged… err, as well as foxes can shrug.</p><P>It
felt really weird hearing <I>the</I>
Kyuubi no Kitsune say 'whatever floats your boat' and shrug.
Naruto always imagined Kyuubi to have been evil and mean, and
defiantly <I>not</I>
shrug.</p><P>The boy crossed his
arms and plopped down on the wet floor.</p><P>"So,
you're sealed in me, and you can't come out until I die, and you
can't be killed, and you live in a sewer, have I got it right?"
he said and looked up at the big fox eyes, it was <I>really
</I>starting to bother him that he
couldn't see more of the fox. Said fox looked amused and chuckled
again.</p><P>"<B>Yes
ningen, that's essentially it. Though you missed one bit. If I get
my full powers back I'll get out. Remember that." </B>The
Kyuubi said more than a little annoyed at having to repeat himself so
many times. Gods, the kid was stupid.</p><P>"EHHHH?! Your full
powers? What do you mean?"</p><P>"<B>Once
every hundred or so years, the bijous power is cut in half. We get
our power back after about two years, and normally we hide at that
time. I, however, didn't hide and decided to do something to relive
my boredom. I attacked Konoha. You humans are weak and pose no
problem for me, until that </B><I><B>stupid</B></I><B>
Hokage of your came. </B></p><P>"<B>I
didn't expect there to be a man with such power in the human realm.
But he would've still lost if it weren't for that annoying
technique."</B></p><P>If Naruto didn't know
any better he would've thought the Kyuubi was sulking.</p><P>"<B>Now it'll take
about fourteen years before my power returns."</B></p><P>Naruto looked deep in
thought and was gazing up at the ceiling.</p><P>"<I>Why</I>
do you lose half your power?" he asked at last, looking very
interested. He had completely forgotten why he came down here in the
first place, and Kyuubi hoped he wouldn't remember anything yet.</p><P>"<B>The Great God
Inari-sama who created us installed this little function, though I
have no idea why. Probably so that we won't become arrogant, what
with us being superior to every other spices that has ever existed
and all that." </B></p><P>"Okey,
I can buy that. But you said you guys hide for two years before, how
dose a several thousand feet fox <I>hide</I>
for <I>two years</I>?"
Naruto asked with raised eyebrows.</p><P>The Kyuubi laughed at
Narutos dumbfounded expression.</p><P>"<B>Easy,
either we just go back to hell or we do this."</B>
He said and a mighty fire erupted around his body allowing Naruto to
see it for a second. It was muscular yet still lean; indicting that
he was built for speed. His fur was red, as if he wore the blood of
his victims as armor. He was majestic and Naruto was in awe.</p><P>When
the fire had disappeared the fox was gone too and in its place were
the most beautiful man the boy had ever seen. The man wore a simple
red haori and black hakama and looked at him with amusement evident
in his fiery red eyes.</p><P>"W-w-w-what?!
Who are you?!" he yelled and scrambled back from the man. He
suddenly remembered the three men from the school and started crying.</p><P>"<B>Child,
don't fear me, I won't do to you what they did."</B>
He spoke with a surprisingly mild voice. Naruto looked up at him and
took in the outstretched hand with slender finger ending in deadly
claws and the blood red hair, so similar to the Kyuubis fur.</p><P>"K-Kyuubi?" he
asked in a frightened voice.</p><P>"<B>Yes
child, I am indeed the Kyuubi. This is how we hide, in the form of a
human."</B> Kyuubi said and motioned
to Naruto to take his hand.</p><P>Carefully
Naruto crawled forward and did as instructed. Kyuubi gently pulled
him past the bars of his cage and into his arms. Naruto cuddled into
his warmth and cried.</p><P>"<B>It's
alright child, cry it out."</B> The
red-haired man said and hugged the boy closer.</p><P>He had no idea why he
behaved like this, sure he pitied the brunette and admired his
courage, but that didn't qualify as a reason. Especially as he
acted as he would around his mate.</p><P>They stayed like that
until Naruto had cried himself dry. Kyuubi knew that the men were
gone and quickly healed his jailor.</p><P>"<B>You
have to go back now child."</B> The
Kyuubi said and looked down at thepitiful boy in his arms.</p><P>"Don't
wanna." Said boy replied, his voice slightly muffled by Kyuubis
chest. The demon chuckled and pulled the boy to his feet.</p><P>"<B>If
I tell you my real name we will be able to communicate through
thoughts, is that enough?"</B> he
asked a slight smile in his full lips. Naruto nodded and the demon
leaned down to whisper in his ear.</p><P>"<B>It's
Akira."</B> He said and the
straightened out again. <B>"Now, go
outside the bars and I'll do the rest."</B>
Naruto nodded obediently and walked out.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>When he woke up he lay
on the floor in the personnel room fully dressed. He rose slowly to
his feet and looked around. Ah, yes, his homework. He picked it up
and stared at the cover of the book. It looked so innocent, and yet
it was the reason to all this mess.</p><P>'<I>Akira?'
</I>He thought uncertainly.</p><P>'<I><B>Yes,
child?'</B></I> Naruto was overcome
with relief as Akira answered him.</p><P>'<I>Nothing.'
</I>He said and walked out the door.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Down in his cage Akira
smiled to himself, fully understanding why Naruto had contacted him.</p><P>'<I><B>You're
not alone anymore. I'll protect you, my mate.'</B></I>
He thought, and then promptly choked on his own tongue. <I><B>'THE
HELL?! I did not just think that! He's a kid for Inari-sama's
sake!'</B></I></p><P>He
transformed into his fox form again and laid his head on his front
paws, thoroughly disturbed.</p><P>'<I><B>I'm going
insane, that's the only explanation.'</B></I></p><P>§§§§§</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
YAY! Chapter done! And I'm sorry Naru-chan! 'hugs Naruto hard'</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:</B>
Yes, you're done, but it took a hell of a lot nagging for you to
sit down and write.</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
Yeah, yeah, so WHAT! I had tests, and I broke my leg and so on!</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:
</B>You didn't have that many tests
and you didn't break your leg. You're just making up excuses!</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
So what if I am, I still wrote it! Nya! 'sticks tongue out'</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:</B>
'slaps her forehead' UGH! Why do I put up with you?</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
Because you live inside my head and you can't get out?</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:</B>
IT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION!</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
'ignores completely' Please review, it'll inspire me to write
faster next time. 'bows'</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:</B>
DON'T IGNORE ME!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>§§§§§</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B>
Haven't we been over this already?</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Naruto woke up in cold
sweat, screaming. It was still in the middle of the night but he
would never be able to fall asleep again. He pulled his knees to his
chest and hugged them. He dreamt of the rape he had been exposed
to earlier that day.</p><P>'<I><B>Are
you alight, kit?'</B></I> a voice
suddenly said. Terrified, Naruto looked around in his small
apartment.</p><P>"W-who's there?"</p><P>'<I><B>It's
me, child, Akira.'</B></I> The voice
said again, this time Naruto realized it was coming from inside his
head.</p><P>'<I>Akira?'</I></p><P>'<I><B>Yes.
Are you alright? Do you want to come down here?'</B></I>
Akira answered and Naruto nodded his head. Suddenly, everything went
black and Narutos body slumped down on his bed again.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>This
time, he ended up in the gigantic room at once. Akira was in his
human form andimmediately, the small boy
ran up to him and threw himself in his arms, making both of them fall
to the ground. He cried hard, and Akira's intense wish to kill the
despicable ningnes grew. They had dared touch <I>his</I>
mate, <I>and</I>
they had made him cry! Yes, he would kill them and then he would
torture their souls in the cruelest way he could imagine. He choked
on his tongue again.</p><P>'<I><B>He
is </B></I><I><U><B>not</B></U></I><I><B>
my mate, goddamnit! He's a kid that I happen to be sealed inside,
</B></I><I><U><B>not</B></U></I><I><B>
my mate!'</B></I> The Kyuubi was
annoyed at himself. He <I>still</I>
hadn't gotten his sub consciousness to understand that Naruto <I><U>was
not his mate.</U></I></p><P>'<I><B>It's the
loneliness, damnit, it has to be!'</B></I></p><P>"<B>Child,
are you alright?"</B> he asked again
when Naruto had stopped crying. The boy nodded and buried his face in
his chest. Akira sighed, he was lying.</p><P>"<B>Oi
kit, talk about it. They say that it helps."</B>
He said, not unkindly. Naruto shook his head and pushed himself even
closer to the demon. Said demon had to bite back a groan as Narutos
hips was pushed firmly against his crotch.</p><P>"Just… let me stay
like this for a while. Just a little while longer." Naruto mumbled
and Akira sighed in defeat.</p><P>"<B>Alright,
kit." </B>He said, and shifted to a
more comfortable position on the wet floor.</p><P>They sat like that for
some time, it could have been minutes or hours or even days.</p><P>Naruto had stopped
crying some time ago. He found it quite funny that the reason for his
suffering and an all-around evil fox demon was the only one he
trusted enough to cry in front of.</p><P>"Akira?"</p><P>"<B>Yes child?"</B></p><P>"I have to go to
school today." The king nodded, he knew that. "Witch means I have
to go soon." Akira nodded again and lessened his hold on the girly
boy.</p><P>"<B>Go
then little one, I will be here if you need me. It's not like I
have somewhere else to be."</B> He
said with a smirk and Naruto laughed a bit.</p><P>The small boy rose to
his feet and walked out of the cage and faded from the Kyuubis view.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Naruto blinked and his
dirty ceiling swam into his view. He got up and felt oddly rested
even though he had stayed up half night crying. One quick look at the
clock told him that he had to hurry.</p><P>His morning toilet was
quickly out of the way and he was waiting impatiently for his ramen
to be cooked. When it was done he ate it at a break-neck speed and,
as soon as he was done, ran out of the apartment, not bothering to
lock the door. All he had of value had already been stolen or broken.</p><P>He arrived at the
academy at the last moment, out of breath.</p><P>"I'M SORRY I'M
LATE, IRUKA-SENSEI!" He yelled as he threw the sliding door open.</p><P>Iruka sighed and
motioned for Naruto to take a seat.</p><P>"As
I was saying before I was interrupted," at this he threw an annoyed
look at Naruto, "We're going to have a pop-quiz on Kyuubi no
Kitsune. I hope everyone did their homework, if you did this'll be
easy." He said and started to hand out sheets of paper.</p><P>Naruto froze at the
mention of the homework, some people saw and concluded that he hadn't
done it. Akira sensed his hosts' distress and gently steered his
thoughts away from the day before.</p><P>'<I><B>The
irony, the day after we start talking you get a pop-quiz on me. I'll
help you child, after all, I doubt anyone knows more than I do.'
</B></I>Naruto smiled at Akiras joke.</p><P>'<I>Thanks.' </I></p><P>"Hey
Naruto," someone said from his right. Naruto turned and looked
straight into the obsidian eyes of Uchiha Sasuke. "You can look at
my paper." He said and offered a small, almost unnoticeable smile.
Naruto smiled at him.</p><P>"Nah,
I think I can pull this one of. Thanks anyway, Sasuke." He answered
with a seductive purr at Sasukes name, and snickered internally as
the Uchiha shuddered.</p><P>"Alright." Said
Uchiha answered with a slightly dazed look in his eyes.</p><P>Just then a sheet of
paper landed on his desk and he looked up at Iruka. Naruto smiled at
his favorite teacher and picked his pen up.</p><P>The
questions were ridiculously easy with Akiras help, and he was
finished long before the others. Well, maybe Sakura was faster, but
that's beside the point. Iruka was about to scream at him for not
working when Naruto grinned and pushed his test to the edge of his
bench for Iruka to see. The teachers' eyes nearly popped out of his
skull when he saw that the girly boy was already done.</p><P>He walked away in a
slight daze with Naruto grinning like a Cheshire cat behind his back.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Naruto's
good mood was ruined at the end of their last class for the day. One
of the three men from yesterday walked in. The boy started to tremble
and his eyes darted around, looking for an escape route. The man
noticed his behavior and grinned evilly.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Inside
his cage Akira was growling and trashing against his bars in his
human form. His instincts were screaming for the mans' blood. He
himself was actually screaming for his blood too. He wished his
powers could hurry up and return soon with every fiber in his being,
if only for the fact that he wanted, no <I>needed</I>,
to kill that… <I><B>thing</B></I>.</p><P>"<B>I'll
kill them!"</B> He promised his host,
<B>"I'll hunt them down and kill
them slowly, and then I'll torture their souls until they are not
able to comprehend pain anymore, after that, I'll beg Kami-sama
until my mouth is bleeding to have their souls destroyed!"</B></p><P>The
Kyuubi doubled his attempt to break out. He slammed both his chakara
and his body, now in fox form, against the gate. It didn't work,
though. He howled in frustration and tried again.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>Naruto concentrated on
the fox's words and felt oddly reassured by Akiras promises. He
drew strength from the fact that the most powerful being able to walk
the earth wanted to destroy his tormentors so completely.</p><P>But
he still trembled all over, searching for exits and eyes darting
fearfully to the man talking to Iruka-sensei. Two deep breaths later
and he were in control again. He turned to the boy next to him.
Grinning like a maniac he let a puff of warm air from his mouth hit
Sasukes ear.</p><P>Sasuke jumped visibly
and turned his head towards Naruto so quickly he was surprised his
neck didn't break.</p><P>"Naruto,
what the hell?!" he asked in a harsh whisper. Naruto looked as
innocent as he could and turned huge honest eyes to Sasuke.</p><P>"But
Sasuke, I thought you liked me…" He answered and his eyes
started to tear up. The Uchiha looked horrified as a tear rolled down
his doll like cheek.</p><P>"Ahh,
it's okay, you can do whatever you want! Just please don't cry!"
He waved his arms chibi-style. (<B>AN:</B>
Can anyone imagine Sasuke doing this?) Narutos face was split by a
grin and the twinkle in his eyes told Sasuke he had just been
tricked.</p><P>He
scowled and turned his head to the other side and refused to
acknowledge Naruto's existence. The brunette sniggered and turned
his head to the front of the classroom when he heard the sliding door
open. The man was finally leaving. Naruto heaved a sigh of relief.</p><P>"Well then class,
it's time to go home for you." Iruka said and drew Naruto's
attention again The students cheered and filed (read: fled) out the
door, Naruto was one of them.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>When he was home he
quickly shut and locked the door behind him. He lay down on his coach
and prepared to contact Akira.</p><P>'<I>Thanks
Akira.'</I> He thought, the gratitude
could clearly be heard in his mental voice.</p><P>Puzzled, Akira answered
him.</p><P>'<I><B>For
what?'</B></I> Naruto giggled at the
confused tone.</p><P>'<I>For
promising their ultimate death.'</I>
He thought softly, blushing a very interesting shade of red.</p><P>Akira growled at the
mention of the three men.</p><P>'<I><B>Think
nothing of it kit, I will do it smiling.'</B></I>
His mental voice was harsh but Naruto knew that harshness was not
directed at him.</p><P>'<I>Still,
thank you.'</I></p><P>'<I><B>Come
down?'</B></I> Akira made it sound
like a question and Naruto agreed and his world faded form his eyes.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P>This time when Naruto
came down to the cage holding the king, he was in his fox form. The
huge glowing eyes opened as he entered.</p><P>"<B>Welcome
kit."</B> He said fondly and raised
his head from its previous resting place on his paws. At least,
that's what Naruto assumed as he still couldn't see anything but
the eyes.</p><P>"Hi
Akira. You know it's really, <I>really</I>
starting to bother me that I can't see anything more than your
eyes." The boy said and voicing his thoughts aloud.</p><P>The Kyuubi looked
surprised for a moment then he chuckled, and as always the sound had
waves of pleasure shooting down the young boy's spine.</p><P>Suddenly the room
brightened and he could see Akira's entire fox body. Naruto blinked
owlishly and stared at the Kyuubi.</p><P>"Err… Thanks?" He
said, slightly dazzled, "How'd you do that? And why haven't you
done it before?"</p><P>Akira shrugged.</p><P>"<B>It's
not that hard, I just will the room to be brighter. I suppose the
only reason I haven't done it before is because I haven't thought
about it. I'm used to it being dark, it makes it easier to sleep
the days away." </B>Naruto nodded
still looking somewhat dazzled and walked through the bars.</p><P>He snuggled up to
Akira's silky fur and sighed in contentment. Said fox wrapped one
of his tails around the child and curled around him.</p><P>"<B>Go
to sleep kit, Lord knows you need it."</B></p><P>Naruto nodded and
snuggled deeper into the warmth that was Akira. He felt completely
safe, like nothing could ever harm him as long as the king was close.
Soon he was sound asleep.</p><P>§§§§§</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
Hi, I'm sorry I'm a bit late with his one, and that it is so
short, I wanted to make it longer, but it seemed like a good place to
stop, so I did.</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:</B>
And to all of you who says 'OMG, Naruto got raped the night before,
how can he act like nothing happened and even flirt with Sasuke?!'
there is a reason.</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
Yeah that's right, Naruto is so used to surprising his feelings
that he now dose itunconsciously. He completely
ignores the stress he's feeling and instead works it out behind
closed (and locked) doors.</p><P><B>Yuri-chan:</B>
That's about it I think. Review and I'll his Yura-chan over the
head with a frying pan until she wrights.</p><P><B>Yura-chan:</B>
HEY!!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br>Hello my faithful readers<P>Hello my faithful
readers!</P><P>I'm sorry if you feel
disappointed in me for my lack of update, and for that I'm sorry.
But I feel out of Naruto fandom and I had a lot to do. I've also
read through my previous chapters and come to the conclution that
they suck. Big time.</P><P>My Kyuubi has more mood
swings than a pregnant woman, and Naruto is so far out of character
it's not even funny. I have also noticed that I have plot holes the
size of Russia that I need to remedy.</P><P>Everything is just far
too fast paced for it to be realistic, and I no longer like girly
completely submissive Naruto. He is like a girl with a prick, for
Gods sake. My writing style needs a lot of work, and it simply feels
wrong. I'll re-write the first chapters once I have enough
inspiration to do so. I'll also have to change my entire overview,
or whatever the fuck it's called, of my story. Don't worry, I
haven't abandoned it. I'll try my hardest to finish it, but I
make no promises.</P><P>And
on another note, I have a new plotbunny
sitting on my desk and demands to be written, one that I quite
frankly likes a whole lot more than this one. It's also a
semi-romance story between Naruto and a male Kyuubi, but with a twist
I don't think anyone else has thought of, ever. At least not on
this site. So be on the lookout for a story that is a hell of a lot
better than this one from me.</P><P>Thank you for still
sticking with me despite my lousy updating habits, I know how
frustrating it can be.</P><P>Again, Thank you.</P><P>Yura-chan</P>
