Just....not the way anyone thought he would. He's been sending Naruto hot and steamy dreams every time he falls asleep. Does the Kyuubi have something for our adorably annoying genin, or is just trying to drive the poor pre-teen to insanity? Will Naruto tell anyone about the obvious troubles that he is causing him, or will something happen between them? Sorry, but you have to read to find out.</p><p>THIS SUDDENLY POPPED INTO MY HEAD AROUND TWO THIS AFTERNOON, NOW IM GOING TO WRITE THE STORY.</p><p>It's that simple people.</p><p><b>WARNING!!!!!!</b></p><p><b>WARNING!!!!!!</b></p><p><b>WARNING!!!!!</b></p><p>THIS IS A YOAI AND A <b>YOUNG BOY --- GROWN MAN RELATIONSHIP</b> FANFIC. If you have any problems with sex/having sex and stuff along this lines, this is not for you. it consists of a twelve year old having sex with a man twice his age (not really.... more like four-hundred times his age....) and if you are offended by the thought of a child and a grown man in a sexual realtionship, please leave.

Dont flame me, 'cause i might burn your house down.</p><p>I don't want to get in a fight with anyone, i just want to write my story.</p><p><i><hr></i></p><p align='center'><i>XXXXXXXXXX</i></p><p align='center'><i>"Ah...."</i></p><p align='center'><i>Leaning forward, he rubbed the side of Naruto's whiskered marked face and brushed the hair out of his eyes. His throat hummed with anticipation as he gazed into the boy's eyes. He pulled forward, his long arms curving sensuously around his waist. The boy, flushed, was pulled down against him and Naruto looped his arms loosely around his neck. They were both sitting facing each other, Naruto balanced on his knees, leaning forward, while the other on his back. Licking his lips, he looked everywhere but at him. "I'm not supposed to be here," Naruto squeaked, trying to stay as calm as possible when the last thing he wanted to do was talk.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>So?" He grinned, sharp fangs coming close to his throat. A low growl sounded and he rose from his back to now sitting. "You still came didn't you?" Naruto's body shivered as heat so pronounced and profound plagued his body. It was like the man underneath him was fire, burning him and biting at him if he got to close. He groaned as his fangs nipped at his jaw before lustfully going back to suck his neck.</i></p><p align='center'><i>Naruto could finally tare his gaze away from his."Someone has to make sure you don't get out." He whispered. Playfully the other's lips hovered over his, touching yet not touching. He nipped at his bottom lips before he settled over the younger's pulse point. He squirmed to get closer to him, his grip around his neck tightening.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>Relax," the other breathed before he clamped his lips over his. He sucked harshly, and one hand lay teasingly over his behind, waiting and ready. His fingers coiled around the thin fabric that protected the boy.</i></p><p align='center'><i>With his eyes scrunched tight and his back arched Naruto let out a puff of air. "I-I can't," he whispered between the other mans lips. The suckling of his mouth had his moans increasing and when his hand traced the tender skin of his thighs he trembled against him.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>Naruto," he gently said.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>W…What?" Naruto said through his helpless moans, looking down at the man sitting underneath him.</i></p><p align='center'><i>Naruto turned his head, no longer able to keep kissing him with the current rushing through him. His hips moved side to side by themselves, his spiky hair matted down with the sweat he was exerting. The other mans arm went around his back, stroking and gripping the hard muscles.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>Have you ever masturbated before?" He shook his head because it was easier than saying no.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>W-What does … What does t-that mean?" he said through gasps and light whimpers. Having lived an isolated life, he had never heard of such a word.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>It's when you touch yourself for pleasure," he summoned yokai on his right hand and caused Naruto's right hand to stick to it; he had total control over it. He then slowly slid it over the smaller boy's boxers.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>A-Ahh!" he scrunched his eyes and his pelvis arched into his hand.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>W-w-w-what are you doing!" he yelped as he tried to yank his hand away, trying to wiggle out of his grip around his waist. That was when he gently pushed Naruto's hand into the thin fabric using his hand that was connected to the younger boy. Naruto arched his back and gave off a loud wail, his face exploding into red. He pumped and swirled the thumb in a circular motion, earning another loud wail. He could feel Naruto's shorts becoming damp. Using his right hand, the other slid it off and continued to rub his length, leaving the other boy completely naked.</i></p><p align='center'><i>In order to quiet him, the other took his mouth in a searing kiss and his fingers slid around his moist opening. He swallowed his cries and gave him back his own. Naruto was wet and hot, and his body arched sexually against his. The others arousal got more painful and just from hearing his moan, feeling his body arch into his, he almost nearly lost it right there. But patience was a virtue and all good things came to those who wait. He planted small kisses along his collarbone, enjoying the small cuts he would leave from his fangs.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>I'm just showing you what it means," he said to Naruto with a taunting voice. Naruto covered his mouth, afraid he would scream if he didn't. Using his left hand, the other gathered yokai and Naruto's other hand stuck to his. Then, he brought it down from his mouth and onto his chest and twisted his nipple. His moans became helpless cries; his breath was short as his face burned almost blood red. A knot was slowly tying itself inside his stomach making itself uncomfortable by his tenet. With a gasp, his knees gave way, making him fall forward onto the others lap. He clenched his eyes and whimpered into the older man's chest.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>A-ah, AH!"</i></p><p align='center'><i>He grunted and hissed between his teeth and fisted the others hair. His hand felt good on his erection and he closed his eyes and swore beneath his breath. The other knew it wouldn't take long, not when the boy ached like this.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>Ngg….A-Ahh, </i><i><b>Ahh</b></i><i>!"</i></p><p align='center'><i>The knot came undone violently. He arched his back as far as it would go and screamed as spasms of pleasure rocked through his body and the liquid fire shot out of him. His eyes were wide, revealing the unfocused lust-filled irises behind them. The other found them rather erotic. As his climax ended, he slowly slid down the others chest, his head drooped down.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>Ah...Ah…Th-that…was," the other silently hushed him. "That felt…that f-felt so good." He laughed lightly as he gently stroked Naruto's cheek. They were both sweaty and hot.</i></p><p align='center'><i>He kissed his shoulder.</i></p><p align='center'>"<i>Ah...K…k-Kyuubi-sama." He touched him again, thrusting his hips up into his. Oh god.</i></p><p>Naruto woke up gasping and his heart beating a mile a minute. There was a fine sheet of perspiration covering his skin as if he had done something exerting besides just waking up.</p><p>He didn't need to see to know that his skin was flushed. His eyes looked about the dark room unhurriedly and he couldn't shake off the tingles that race up and down his spin. His head felt unnaturally heavy and there was wetness that hadn't been there when he went to bed. He felt shaken and had a desire for completion. He groaned.</p><p>"Crap, not another one," he groaned out loud. He brought his hand up to stomach mentally trying to slow down her heartbeat. He blushed when he remembered the dream, remembering what woke him up.</p><p>Two weeks. It was two weeks ago that he learned about the Kyuubi from Misaki-sensei. Then he started having these wet dreams that would wake him up in the middle of the night on the brink of something. He groaned at how empty and lonely he always felt once he awakened.</p><p>"Damn it," he muttered mostly to himself, glad that Kakashi-sensei hadn't decided to check up on him. "They feel so real."</p><p>Sitting up in his bed, he wondered for the thousandths time why he was having these dream. It's not like he enjoyed having the demon, or had a secret crush on him or something. He was too embarrassed, and slightly afraid to bring up his dreams to his sensei and he rather die of humiliation instead of telling his teammates.</p><p>At the thought of his new teammates, his blush took on new heights. "Stop being a stupid girl," he told himself in a scornful tone. He was all alone with no one but his thoughts and he couldn't stop blushing.</p><p>Naruto took a deep, steadying breath to calm his racing thoughts and body. He swung his legs to the side of the bed and stumbled over his disorderly floor on the way to the bathroom. His legs felt like jelly. Once there he began his newly made midnight ritual of taking a warm shower and then practicing his kunai with the unfortunate wall panel. Yet it never did anything to chase away the heat that still clung to him. Once done he'd turn on the lights and proceed to clean up the apex of his thighs.</p><p>He tried hard not to look in the mirror above the sink but he couldn't help himself. His eyes were involuntarily drawn to itself. With an absurd fascination, he looked at his reflection.</p><p>His lips were swollen as if they had been kissed, and his eyes were light with an emotion in them he didn't recognize. Inhaling deeply, he turned away from his image. He couldn't stand to see himself looking like a woman who just got molested.</p><p>Masturbating?</p><p>What the hell was that?</p><hr><p>XXXXXXXXXXX</p><p>The genin leaned against the red painted wood railing of the bridge, looking out at the river underneath. The sun had only just started to rise over the horizon, the crickets and buzzers still making noises, and there the fog was still rose slightly off the ground.</p><p>It was so strange not seeing the others here before him, him usually being late. He sighed and slumped against the railing fully, sliding down until he hit the grounds. He'd arrived first because he decided not to go back to sleep last night.</p><p>Team seven had been given only D class missions since they started two weeks ago, something that annoyed even Sakura, who hated to be stressed with too much work. Naruto was more annoyed at the fact that most of his time was being taken up by the Fire Lord's Wife, and her stupid fucking cat that just couldn't stay put.</p><p>Naruto Yawned and stared out blankly. <i>'Kakashi-sensei better not be late or…'</i></p><p>"Naruto?!" The Kyuubi host blinked and turned around. Sakura ran up to him, slowing down so she didn't look like an idiot. She looked around. "Why the hell are you so early? Where's Sasuke-Kun?" Naruto pouted and grinned. No matter how bad his morning was, he was still on Sakura-Chan's team; still it still sucked how she always obsessed about the bastard.</p><p>"Sakura-Chan!" he grinned as he flung himself forward in an attempt to get hug her. She 'eeped' then punched him hard on the head to stop him.</p><p>"IDIOT!!" he muttered, trying to sooth the bruises on his skull with his fingers. Sakura scowled at him.</p><p>"Saaaaakkura-Chan!" He whined. He scowled back, not in the mood to be the submissive one. Her angry expression dropped when she got a closer look at his face.</p><p>"Naruto …. Did you even sleep last night?" his eyes were bloodshot, dark bags underneath his eyes. His normally lively face was pale and withdrawn. Naruto attempted to grin.</p><p>How could he sleep? Along with his x-rated dreams and thought, his body and mind felt exhausted. The screaming, the moaning, <i>the feelings! </i>How many more nights could he stand watching himself do what he does before he screams.</p><p>"I slept just great Sakura-Chan!" He yelled, lying through his teeth. It was really hard to keep up this loudness. She turned to yell, just about to call his bluff when Kakashi and Sasuke appeared on the side of the bridge.</p><p>"Yo." They both stared at him with wide eyes. Kakashi and Sasuke arched an eyebrow, wondering if they had done something. Kakashi looked down; pretty sure he had put his vest on the right way and zipped up his pants.</p><p>"Y-y-y-y-y-y-You…you," She stuttered. Naruto fell on his butt, his hands braced in front of him defensively uncertain.</p><p>"You can't possibly be Kakashi-sensei…." He muttered. Sasuke glared at him. "Dobe…" Naruto glared back at him. Kakashi rubbed the back of his head, even more confused. He sighed.</p><p>"Huh?" his confusion made Naruto and Sakura jump up in union, pointing their fingers at him.</p><p>"You're not late!" they yelled. They sweat dropped. Early?</p><p>Oh.</p><p>He was pretty early. '<i>Damn…if this happens again, someone might think I'm actually responsible.'</i> He gagged at the thought. Responsible people were predictable. He <i>hated</i> being predictable.</p><p>"Ehh? …ah, I'm here early because… I'm testing your ninja skills!" Nice save. The genin's looked at him in surprise that in thought. Oh yeah, he was slick. Kakashi: three points. Innocent students: zero. He was on a roll.</p><p>Sakura became hopeful. "So you're not going to be late anymore!?" Kakashi smiled behind his mask, his visible eye curving up.</p><p>"What do you think?" he said sweetly. Naruto and Sakura scowled at him while Sasuke rolled his eyes.</p><hr><p>XXXXXXXXXX</p><p>"Sensei," Naruto whined pitifully as he watched the elderly groomer show they how to shave a cat, "please, this is soooooo boring. Can't we have another mission? Isn't there some cat that got kidnapped by an army of cat thieves or a runaway dog we can chase all over the village again?" it was easy to slip into the character of the person full of energy, even though his entire body ached. He needed to sleep, he just didn't want to.</p><p>Kakashi smiled down at Naruto through his mask and ruffled the blonde's hair affectionately, or at least it seemed that way. Actually Naruto found it to be not only a bit annoying but also quite painful.</p><p>"This is a very important mission, Naruto," the jounin explained, his other two students also eyeing him annoyed. "If we don't shave the cats, who will?"</p><p>"How about the damn groomer!" Naruto pointed at the man, who was now showing an unnerved Sasuke how to shave a long haired cats butt without hurting its 'cute' pink flesh. Everyone shivered.</p><p>"IDIOT!!" the pink haired kunoichi yelled and bumped him on the head. He screech startled many of the cats. "Just shut up and work!" Naruto growled, holding his head.</p><p>"I KNOW THAT!" He yelled back receiving three shocked looks – which he supposed wasn't good. He didn't yell at Sakura. It went against their Naruto-loves-Sakura-and-cant-get-mad-at-her-cause-she's-the-love-of-his-life routine. Crap, he slipped up. They stared at each other blankly, not knowing what to do.</p><p>Kakashi sighed, "We just take the missions we're given. There weren't any other D rank Missions left by the time we got there, so this was our only choice."</p><p>"BUT WE GOT THERE EARLY!" they yelled in union.</p><p>As the explanation and demonstration came to an end, having only heard by Sasuke (reluctantly) and slightly by Sakura, the elder man led them into a bigger room with at least three times as many cats. There was hair everywhere, on the floor, the tables, the sink, the walls, even the ceiling. Many of the cats were hissing through their cages, one tried to swipe at Kakashi as he passed. They learned that this was the room for the harder cases. All the animals either hated everything, wanted to claw you to ribbons, or chew you to hell and they were all here. Naruto swore he spotted Tora, the Fire lord's wife's cat in one of the cages. Crap.</p><p>Each genin was handed a razor, a stool, a pair of gloves, and told to "have fun" by Kakashi and were sent into the room. Since this mission was about completion and not teamwork Kakashi told them he would not be working with them, but would observe from afar. Sakura grumbled that he just wanted to read his book. That was when the cats they were holding decided Sakura's forehead looked like a great scratching post, Sasuke's balls were two hiding mice, and Naruto was the devil's incarnate.</p><p><b>"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!</b>"</p><p>The genin's screams of pain were said to be heard throughout the village, and that the Hokage even flinched.</p><hr><p>XXXXXXXXXXX</p><p align='center'>"<i>Save it," he told him abruptly.</i></p><p align='center'><i>Naruto glared, annoyed. "You can't be mad at me. I had no idea my team was going to do this. How the hell was I supposed to know the old man was going to grope me after I fell unconscious!? It's not like I wanted to fall unconscious stupid!! "</i></p><p align='center'><i>Kyuubi didn't spare him a glance as he polished his armor. He could hear Naruto's exhale of breath and as he stomped his foot in anger. He grunted and continued with his task. He wasn't jealous – technically. And so what if he was? No one touched his possession unless he wanted to die. It didn't matter if the poor sap hadn't meant to when he lifted the little boy up.</i></p><p align='center'><i>It was the principle of the matter damn it.</i></p><p align='center'><i>Naruto saw through his 'I don't want to talk and if you keep bothering me I'll eat you' act and pursed his lips in annoyance. With a single minded purpose, he plucked the items from Kyuubi's hands before he could say a word. He glared up and made a sound of exasperation which was stifled in shock as the younger boy straddled his thighs.</i></p><p align='center'><i>Shock barely registered in his brain before he kissed him. Naruto's mouth moved softly against his unyielding one. His fingers greedily found the softness of his dark red hair and held his mouth to his. Pulling apart, he stared intrepidly into his angry eyes.</i></p><p>"Hey?"</p><p align='center'>"<i>Kissing me isn't going to change anything," he told him, his voice deeper. His hands found themselves around Naruto's waist.</i></p><p align='center'><i>A minx like glint entered his eyes and he slowly licked his lips. Naruto stroked his neck and tail and was delighted at how glazed he looked by his action. Bending down, he nibbled on his neck and murmured, "Why not? It works for you all the time?"</i></p><p>"Hey, Naruto?"</p><p align='center'><i>He lifted Naruto's head from his neck and grimaced, not amused.</i></p><p align='center'><i>He could see the jealously he tried to mask with anger and his thundering expression helped him get to his conclusion. Demons were primal, domineering, and possessive. </i></p><p align='center'><i>He had to admit the he like the blood red monster taking hold of Kyuubi. He was always so calm and collected that he found it maddening. Naruto always found it hard to gauge his disposition. </i></p><p>"Naruto Wake up already!"</p><p align='center'><i>Leaning forward, he planted a chaste kiss on his lips. "I think you're Crazy." He glared up at him. He kissed him once more. "In a good way." he leaned in for another chaste kiss but Kyuubi quickly took control of it. </i></p><p align='center'><i>Head spinning from his addicted kisses and the rushing blood-</i></p><p>"Naruto if you don't get up I'm going to kick you!"</p><p align='center'><i>-He didn't notice when he gotten up and pinned him underneath him. Naruto pulled apart gasping and his eyes grew wide as he felt the hard length of Kyuubi's arousal through his pants. </i></p><p align='center'>"<i>Y-You….you tricked me!" he looked around them for a possible escape route. "You planned this!"</i></p><p>"NARUTO!"</p><p align='center'><i>Kyuubi shrugged, "So?" he licked his lips. "It's not like we have time." Naruto stared up at him in confusion. He grinned back and came down for a chaste kiss. "Wake up."</i></p><p>"WAKE UP!!!"</p><p><b>BAAAAMMMM!!!!</b></p><p>Naruto woke up with a gasp, the air being knocked out of him with a kick to the gut. His eyes flew open and he noticed a couple things at once. One: he wasn't at the groomers anymore. Two: he was on the ground with his team standing over him. And Three: he really, really, really needed to pee.</p><p>He frowned into the dirt. How the hell did he get there? He cursed, remembering how he was attacked by the demon cats and ended up running head first into a metal cage. He pushed himself up, not that excited by the pain in his chest and glared up at the bastard.</p><p>"Why the hell did you kick me you asshole!" their eyes locked, visible lighting sparks igniting between them. Naruto jumped up, rearing his arm back to hit the bastard.</p><p>"NARUTO!!!" Sakura's fist came out of nowhere, slamming Naruto head back into the ground. "Don't mess with Sasuke-Kun!" Damn that hurt. Naruto crawled back up, a large bump on his head. He would have wisely kept his mouth shut for the rest of the day, but the nagging irritation that they had interrupted something important wouldn't let him.</p><p>"But Sakura-Chan, the bastard kicked me!!" he pointed an accusing finger. Kakashi sighed as the groomer paid his due, and Sasuke rolled his eyes… again.</p><p>"DON'T GET FULL OF YOURSELF!! I HIT YOU YOU IDIOT!!" she yelled back shocking him. Sakura-Chan had hit him not the bastard? Why would she hit him? How could she wasn't he injured?</p><p>"Idiot, you fell asleep." Sasuke said bored, reading his mind. Their winning and yelling was really annoying. Naruto whirled around and snarled. He really, really hated him. The prick was really asking for it, making fun of him all the god damn time!</p><p>"I. Did. Not. Fall. Asleep!" he jumped forward, ready to kill him, when Kakashi grabbed the back of his jumpsuit stopping him. He struggled as Sasuke smirked at him. God, he wanted to rip that smirk off his face.</p><p>"Naruto, stop now." Kakashi-Sensei order him – not told him- ordered. He really had had enough of their horrible teamwork. Just when they did start to have progress, even just a little, these two would go straight back to the beginning. Naruto didn't stop struggling and Sasuke's grin grew.</p><p>"What?" he shoved his hands in his pockets, Sakura stepping closer. "Did we interrupt your beauty sleep?" Naruto shook in rage. How… how dare him!</p><p>"BASTARD," he struggled harder, "I didn't fall asl-"he froze. He stopped fighting, and breathing. The dream slammed into him, replaying itself in his head with startling accuracy. His heart thudded fast in his chest and for a split second he feared he'd pass out. The others looked at him in bewilderment, wondering why he'd stopped so suddenly.</p><p>As if his brain couldn't think of anything less, he remembered the way the Kyuubi had straddled him…umm…the dream him against the ground and kissed him. Along with his other x-rated thoughts and this one all coming together at one time, it was too much.</p><p>Naruto's eyes popped open and unlike the other days, he didn't get over it. His chest heaved and his entire body felt tense and his mouth fell open. He struggled to get air in his lungs as his body released the tension that held him. He didn't move as his team asked what's wrong. He didn't say anything as Sakura walked closer and waved her hand in front of him. Then, just like the dream, reality slammed back in. That feeling, it came again. Running up and down his spine. Naruto knew it as well as he knew the back of his hand. The fight of flight feeling, do or die, get the fuck up or stay down. He did the only thing possible. He ran.</p><p>Yanking himself free from Kakashi he spun, shifting his body weight into his left heel to avoid Sasuke's attempt to grab him. With a lunge forward he ran, passing Sakura who was yelling at him. He pushed harder, unintentionally pushing large amounts of chakra into his legs. He twisted around a corner, not looking back, already knowing Kakashi-Sensei was right behind him by his yell for him to stop. With a push to his legs, he jumped, landing on top of roof. He didn't stop running, even when he didn't hear anyone anymore. He didn't stop as he saw his house, or as he ran up the stairs to his apartment. Getting inside his house, he slammed the door shut, sliding down until he hit the ground.</p><p>Naruto sat there, gasping, his heart beating painfully, soaked. In more ways than one. As always these dreams were more than they were worth but today were the worse. He was pissed to have them in front of everyone.</p><p>He could scream! Tears of frustration gathered inside his eyes as he fisted his hands into his hair, yanking at it. It just wasn't fair. Not fair!</p><p>Why him. Why was he having these? It made no sense to him. Shaking and aroused, he closed his eyes and the dream he just had came into alarmingly focus. This fucking sucked! Couldn't the damn demon just give him nightmares or something!?</p><p>There goes another pair of boxers gone to his stupid dreams…. .</p><p>"Damnit!!" he cursed! He hit his bed when the people he really wanted to hit were probably talking about how weird he just was whereas he's having erotic fucking dreams.</p><p>Bastards!</p><p>XXXXXXXXXX</p><hr><p>..... oh <i>my </i><b><i><u>GOD!!!!!!</u></i></b></p><p>I HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER ,EVER writen a sexy scene before.

Naruto woke up with Kyuubi's arm around his waist and felt one of his legs sandwiched between his. Kyuubi was sitting, his back resting against one of the bars. Kyuubi's eyes were closed and his hair covered his eyes. Naruto sat in his lap, his head rested on Kyuubi's chest, back to chest. Naruto groaned and cuddled into his arm, hearing a soft purr in his ear. Kyuubi hugged him even tighter and Naruto laughed slightly, trying to get up, Unfortunately it was almost impossible to get out of Kyuubi's vise grip.</i></p><p><i>Naruto stopped laughing and bit the inside of his cheek, nervously looking around and wondering if this was a good idea. Kyuubi pressed himself closer and Naruto's cheeks grew hot. A thrill went through him as he shifted his hips up, feeling Kyuubi through their clothes.</i></p><p>"<i>Where do you think you're going?" Kyuubi's voice was raspy and a shiver went down his spin.</i></p><p>"<i>I need to get up," Naruto tried to turn in his arms but Kyuubi held him even tighter, slipping his leg away, kissing Naruto on the neck. He tensed, feeling the warmth of his chapped lips on his neck. "I….I have to meet my team."</i></p><p><i>Wetting his lips, Naruto's breathing got more erratic as the seconds passed. After taking a steady breath, he whispered, "I'm already late." He wasn't used to being this close to someone.</i></p><p><i>Silkily, Kyuubi's thumb went over his chin, which did nothing to alleviate but instead fan the flames of his lust even more. He waited for Kyuubi to pull away from his neck so he could see his masculine body against his. And then he wanted him to claim the kiss he didn't even want when he first entered his cage.</i></p><p><i>Instead of Kyuubi doing what he mentally told, he reached up and ran his hand though Naruto's hair. Naruto's scent reached the demons noise as if drawing him in. His hand ran through again and again. </i></p><p><i>Naruto moaned softly as Kyuubi massaged his scalp and leaned his head back so he could properly run thought it."Gotta go still." He closed his eyes then as the older man's lips suckled on that spot beneath Naruto's ear.</i></p><p>"<i>Not nearly as late as you usually are." Kyuubi's words were seductive, his touch Naruto's undoing. He grew plaint against him as his mouth went lower until he reached his neck again.</i></p><p><i>Tingles rushed up and down Naruto's body and his mouth parted on a breathy moan. "I doubt that that matters to Sakura-Chan…" he finally managed to get out after sometime. Kyuubi groaned at his line of questioning. He had hoped he'd forgotten his foolish affection for his teammate.</i></p><p>"<i>Naruto…" He hesitated in answering since he didn't want him to compare his affection with a half-wit women who wasn't even in his league, "Shut up."</i></p><p><i>His cheeks which were already flush became redder at his double take. He whimpered out his name as Kyuubi left him and cool damp air rushed by his heated body. Taking merely three steps from the small boy, he let his eyes roved over Naruto's almost naked body. Blood shot to his groin and it expanded even more in his pants. </i></p><p>"<i>Naked, now."</i></p><p><i>Naruto sucked in a breath at the callous way he said it and looked down. He moved his hands to the hip of his boxers. His hands shook and he wasn't sure if he could do it. Taking a huge gulp of air and praying for the courage, he pushed the flimsy article of clothing down.</i></p><p>"<i>I….I don't find this amusing," Naruto whispered. He could feel the others eyes roaming his body and looked down in embarrassment.</i></p><p>"<i>So?" Kyuubi leaned forward as an idea formed in her mind. "Do you still want to leave?" Kyuubi asked in his ear, his sharp fangs grazing his neck- up and down. He wrapped his arms around Naruto so that he couldn't get away. Kyuubi's at his thighs, so very close….</i></p><p><i>Naruto's body froze and he suddenly took in a breath. Would he? He wondered briefly as the sexual awareness that had simmered below the surface broke free with his touch. Kyuubi captured his hand in his, gently kneading it.</i></p><p>"<i>Yes," Naruto answered his voice unintentionally gruff with desire. "I gotta go." </i></p><p><i>At his words, Kyuubi tilted Narutohead and turned so that they were facing each other and proceeded to cup his face in his hands. Their lips met half way; the kiss quickly became more lustful in its intent. Naruto couldn't get close enough as he buried his hands in Kyuubi's red hair, his lips opening beneath his prying ones. Somehow they shifted so when they parted he was in front of him. And no longer was he sitting on the floor but sitting in the man's lap, the other holding him.</i></p><p><i>Kyuubi licked the bottom of Naruto's lip as he reached between them and once again took hold of the child's arousal. His finger moving tantalizingly slow over the tip. "Still want to?"</i></p><p><i>Naruto was barely able to mask the whine that threatened to escape once the demon's callused hand grasped him. Kyuubi palmed the roundness of his buttock, kneading the soft yet firm flesh. Kyuubi kissed his way down his chin and up to one of his ears, tugging gently on the earlobe with his sharp teeth. Kyuubi sucked the fleshy part into his mouth. "How about now?" He replied as he nibbled on the spot behind him which caused tingles to race up and down Naruto body. </i></p><p><i>Naruto groaned as Kyuubi hands got into a rhythm of fast strokes around his circumference which he gripped tightly. His eyes closed to concentrate more on the pleasure Kyuubi was giving him as his hand tightened around Kyuubi. The blood rushed through his head as his heart rate suddenly picked up and any rational thought escape him. </i></p><p>"<i>Still want to leave?" Kyuubi inquired as he nuzzled his neck, Naruto's breath coming out in spurts. Chapped lips trailed down his neck, leaving sharp nips here and there and then laving any hurt it might have caused.</i></p><p>"<i>Ah…Kyuu-uubi?" Naruto said his name on a gasp since his teasing hand slowed down. The difference of speed he used over his length presented a shocking difference. </i></p><p><i>Kyuubi smiled at his obvious lack of control and how it was usually this way. Kyuubi ran his free hand along his thigh, feeling his muscle trembled at his touch. His manhood begun to throb more forcefully and the force had Naruto tightening in grip around Kyuubi. He was very close…</i></p><p><i>Kyuubi moved his free hand up and softly cradled his testicles, drawing an intense moan from Naruto as his body jerked forward sharply. Kissing his chest, Kyuubi's tongue swirled around his nipple while never letting up with his hands.</i></p><p>"<i>Kyuu--," he groaned and regretfully stopped the others hands. "I nee—," he took in a deep breath to hold back the dam of emotion, "I need to go, Kyuubi,"</i></p><p><i>Kyuubi stopped, confusion crossing his features. "Why? Do you want the pink girl to touch you instead?"</i></p><p>"<i>NO!" Naruto froze, his mouth unable to form words, "…wait, I mean Yes! No that's not what I, I mean---" </i></p><p><i>Kyuubi swooped down to capture his lips in a deep, greedy kiss. Naruto responded immediately, moaned against his mouth, his arms encircling his broad shoulders. The young boy's fingers tangling fiercely within his inky, red hair. Naruto leaned deeper into him, his eyes closing after reopening for a nanosecond when Naruto felt Kyuubi's touch on his stomach. His skillful hands dipped below his seal and found its way between his thighs.</i></p><p>"<i>Ahh…"</i></p><p><i>Kyuubi twisted Naruto's nipple and kneaded the soft flesh. Naruto moaned into the kiss, his nails leaving crescent moons on the demons back. Naruto's thigh muscles clenched in anticipation and his eyelids grew heavy once he felt his touch on his length. The first brush of Kyuubi hand tenderly stroking the throbbing flesh drew a moan of pleasure from him. Naruto arched his hips into his finger wantonly while circling his hips to draw out the heat. Delicious sensation coursed wildly throughout his veins with every beat of his heart.</i></p><p><i>Naruto gasped his name and his hand went to his shoulders, clutching Kyuubi tightly. Spreading his thighs wider with his other hand, Kyuubi slipped his finger inside him. Naruto's eyes rolled in the back of his head as he caressed him from within after adding a second digit. His inner walls clenched at his intruding finger and Naruto laid his head on Kyuubi's shoulder, breathing heavy.</i></p><p><i>Naruto bit Kyuubi's shoulder, mounting desire rocking his frame. He clung onto him tighter, his name on the tip of Naruto's tongue and ending out in a near scream. Kyuubi, too, stopped his hands and weakly lifted his head. Lust filled the demon as he saw the boys flushed face. </i></p><p><i>Naruto huskily groaned as he took matters into his own hands and removed Kyuubi's hand from its spot to straddled the demons thighs. Naruto thencaressed Kyuubi's face with his wet hands, kissing his lips just as he hoisted himself directly over the other's manhood. Naruto shuddered as he felt the tip at his entrance, his breath caught in his throat. His knees were bent on either side of Kyuubi's hipbone and if he wiggled a certain way, he would be inside him. Naruto broke away from the kiss, his head falling back as he descended.</i></p><p>"<i>Ah!" </i></p><p>"<i>F-fuck," Kyuubi hissed, his grip on Naruto's hip tightening.</i></p><p><i>Naruto moaned as he felt the tips of fangs on his arched neck, reddening the skin there. Naruto rocked his hips against Kyuubiand pushed down until he had Kyuubi all the way inside him. Kyuubi groaned at the tightnessand waited as the boy slowly lifted himself up. Naruto then came down onto him once more.</i></p><p>"<i>You feel..." Kyuubi couldn't continue the sentence as Naruto began to ride him with his hands brace on his shoulders as leverage. His entire body tensed and focused only on the young boy against his frame. Feeling himself slipping into the lust-filled haze, Kyuubi's grip tightened even more.</i></p><p>"<i>Ah … Ahh...Ah-Ah….!"</i></p><p><i>Gripping his hips in his clawed grip, Kyuubi moved his mouth up the boy's throat until his lips covered his. He cupped the back of Naruto's neck and slanted his lips under his. With sure hands, Kyuubitipped Naruto up more and plunged forward into the tightness of his heat with a harsh moan of unbridled lust. Kyuubi nearly came right there with his warmth all around him, the boy around him eagerly meeting his every thrust upward. </i></p><p><i>Kyuubi's tongue pushed inside, touching Naruto's, the heat and taste like nothing Naruto had known before. Behind his closed lids Naruto saw sparks of different colors as his body shook with chaotic pleasure. As air became necessary for the human, the frenzied kiss ended and Kyuubi buried his face in the crane of the boys' neck. The heat intensified around them with their frantic movement. Kyuubi took huge gulps of air as his head began to swim with the incredible sensation, his hips plunged harder and deeper into his belonging as he felt Naruto tighten around him. </i></p><p>"<i>Ngg…Ky-kyuub…bi…" Naruto groaned his name and dug his fingernails into his back.</i></p><p>"<i><b>AH!"</b></i></p><p><i>Naruto nearly jumped out of his skin when Kyuubi gripped his arousal and started to stoke it in time with his thrust. He bit his bottom lip and keened at the unexpected yet thoroughly enjoyed contact.</i></p><p><i>Kyuubi's thrust picked up pace as they lost rhythm to expedite the ultimate pleasure. His pumping hand moving faster than the young boy could comprehend. Trying to force out more, he lifted his head to look at Naruto. </i></p><p>"<i>Nar—"He expelled a breath in a heady rush as the boy consciously tightened and then un-tightened his muscles around him…</i></p><p><i>Sensation coursed through Naruto and he lost his breath when Kyuubi bent his body backwards just enough so he could bite Naruto's nipple. Naruto gripped him harder, his body losing itself in a haze of erotic pleasure. Higher he went, possessing and consumed the boy's body, over and over….</i></p><p>"<i>Ah…Ah…Ah…Ah…" </i></p><p><i>Naruto gasped for air as his pace started to get faster, the boy closed his eyes as his back arched up, so that he felt his sharp and hot breath on his ear. </i></p><p>"<i>Ky…uu…bi…"</i></p><p><i>Kyuubi thrust deeper and faster, making Naruto's moan reach a higher pitch. His fangs lengthened again as he gave a deep moan, he could feel himself coming to his peak. Naruto grabbed onto his shoulder, as his head titled upward to Kyuubi.</i></p><p>"…<i>a…!" Naruto opened his mouth in a soundless scream. His head was thrown back and his eyes went wide and unfocused.</i></p><p><i>The little sounds Naruto was making sent Kyuubi to the limit of his control as he went even faster. </i></p><p><i>"<b>AHHH!!" </b>The boy released first, screaming loud enough to echo through his cage and lubricated his chest.</i></p><p><i>Kyuubi went in even deeper and harder, hitting at a spot the sent shivers up Naruto's body. Kyuubi gave a soft growl as he released inside him, emitting another scream from Naruto. Tears leaked out of Naruto's eyes from the pleasure, the feel of Kyuubi's searing hot seed inside of him brought him to the brink of insanity. </i></p><p><i>They stopped and caught their breaths. however he was still in Naruto and his legs were still wrapped around Kyuubi's hips. Kyuubi started to rock into the boy again, earning a few more screams as Naruto released. Then he pulled his member out and rested by his side; taking a few of his large red tails, he covered himself and Naruto under it. </i></p><p><i>Naruto curled into a ball on his side, and stared the large copper bars in front of them. He felt Kyuubi's tails wrap around his waist and felt his hard muscular chest against his back. He unconsciously hugged the tails closer, enjoying the warmth they gave off.</i></p><p>"<i>Are you alright?" Kyuubi asked as he ran his fangs over one of many bit marks. Naruto turned around to stare at the demon. He opened his mouth, closed it, and then opened it again.</i></p><p>"<i>NO!"</i></p><p>"<b>GHAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!?!?!?!?!?" ….. BAAAM!!!</b></p><p>Naruto fell off his bed, landing face first twitching. Quickly he bolted upright, his chest heaving up and down. He brought a hand to his heart as the dream/molestation replayed itself in his head again and again. His entire body felt tense, his eyes popped out and his mouth fell open. His heart thudded painfully fast in his chest and again for a second he thought he was going to pass out.</p><p>He just laid there on the ground as he <i>felt </i>the orgasm although to a minor degree. Tiny jolts coursed throughout his body.</p><p>"Oh. My. Fucking. God!"</p><p>XXXXXXXXXX</p><hr><p>The mood was utterly depressing. No one said anything as they entered the mission hall. Kakashi wasn't reading his book, instead deciding to walk behind his students, watching the blond intently. Sasuke shot him questioning glances before turning back to glaring at… something. Sakura didn't even do their morning ritual of greeting 'Sasuke-kun!' but instead stared nervously at the ground. Naruto was the worst.</p><p>Slumped, he had forgotten his orange jacket in his apartment. His normal loud cheeriness replaced with a sick depressing feeling. His clothes were wrinkled and his hair was all over the place. His face was pale and withdrawn and large dark bags were underneath his eyes. But the most noticeable difference was his eyes. His normal closed fox- like eyes were wide open staring directly in front of him. Almost out of focus. He was the poster boy for the emotionally wrecked.</p><p>However, this completely contrasted the hissing cat that was trying to eat him.</p><p>"Ow…ow…OWOWOWO<b>WOWOW</b>!!!!" Naruto held the cat as far away as possible as it tried to rip him to shreds. "Someone else hold this damn thing!" Naruto angrily glared at it.</p><p>Sakura finally took the cat after awkwardly trying not to meet Naruto's eyes. Sasuke raised an eyebrow at the way the cat seemed willing to do anything to kill Naruto.</p><p>"Tora doesn't like his owner that much," Kakashi trailed off as he was hit by the air of depression. He sighed as his students all turned away from each other staring at anything else. Teenagers, always so emotional. Kakashi sighed again.</p><p>When they returned the cat to the fire lord's wife, she promptly hugged the poor thing to death. The next few missions they had were simple. Organize the book cases at the local library, pick up some Great Dane crap, paint some fences, and wash an old woman's wood floors….all 59 rooms of them.</p><p>Sakura started slowly while Sasuke had tired a few water justu's. They had both made quick b-lines away from the depressed blond.</p><p>Naruto who was highly annoyed and depressed, however, lined up around the remaining rooms before making 59 clones. Then those 59 made another 59. In the end there were 118 clones, one original, two gawking genins, one happy reading teacher, and one passed out old lady. They whizzed through all the missions and were done around early afternoon. They definitely surprised the Hokage at their fast work.</p><p>"We want harder missions old man," Naruto started glaring holes in the floors wood paneling. How dare it look so happy. The Hokage sighed and rubbed between his eyes. Kakashi sighed as the Hokage sighed; he was going to get scolded later for his student's idiocy.</p><p>"IDIOT!!" Iruka slammed his hands on the desk glaring at them, "You're a <i>genin</i>, and rookies at that! You are too inexperienced to handle anything!" Naruto threw his arms in front of him, forming an X with his arms.</p><p>"NO WAY! I AINT GONNA BE STUCK WITH STINKING D RANKED MISSIONS OLD MAN!" flaring his arms around he glared at the Hokage, "GIVE US SOMETHING HARDER <i>OLD MAN</i>!"</p><p>"You're still a genin, Narutoyou---" The Hokage took a puff of his pipe as he was interrupted. Kakashi <i>really </i>wasn't looking forward to scolding he was going to get later.</p><p>"Hear me out, please, Hokage-sama!" The Hokage stopped raising an eyebrow at his sudden change of behavior. Hokage-sama? Naruto never called him by his official name; it was always old man, geezer, or grand-pa in private. The Hokage complied, knowing if he was willing to plead it was the least he could do. Iruka opened his mouth to object, but was quickly silenced by the Hokage's hand.</p><p>"Geez!! All you do is give lectures like that." The Hokage's eyebrow twitched. This is what he wanted to say? "But you know what?!! I'm not…" He stared at the Hokage, eye's locking.</p><p>"THE TROUBLE-MAKING BRAT YOU STILL THINK I AM!!" he reared his arm up, pointing at his forehead protector, his eyes more intense then they had ever seen.</p><p>"<b>I. AM. A. NINJA!!" </b>there was a moment of silence.</p><p>He huffed, crossing his arms and glared at the ground. Iruka stared at him in shock before slowly smiling, as well as the Hokage.</p><p>"Ok."</p><p>"…huh?" Kakashi stared at him. Wait…What!?</p><p>The Hokage smiled, "If you want it that much…" He smiled at the team, resting his chin on his hands, "I'll give you a c-ranked mission. It's a protection mission of a certain individual.</p><p>"Yay!" Naruto yelled. Team seven looked at him in disbelief. 'No way…' they thought simultaneously.</p><p>'Crap..." Kakashi sighed loudly, Icha Icha Paradise special edition volume three was going to have to be put on hold.</p><p>"WHO?!! WHO?!! A feudal lord?!! A princess?!!" Naruto yelled, his early depression forgotten.</p><p>"Calm down, I'm about to introduce him." He sighed, taking a puff from his pipe, "Hey, will you come in here?" the sound of the door opened alerted the team to the left. The smell of alcohol hit their noses, and Sakura gagged.</p><p>"What this? There all super brats." The old man leaned against the doorframe for support. "Especially…the shortest one with the super stupid-looking face. Are you really a ninja? Hey?!!"</p><p>Naruto laughed turning to look at his team mates, "HAHA!! Who's the shortest one with the stupid face…?" Sakura and Sasuke took a step closer, lining up next to him. Realization set in.</p><p>"I'LL KILL YOU!!!!!!!" Kakashi grabbed the back of his shirt, stopping him. "What's the point of killing the person we're suppose to protect? Idiot!" Kakashi sighed.</p><p>XXXXXXXXXX</p><hr><p>Naruto made it to the gate pretty much on time. He was completely packed, and this time, he didn't forget his jacket. Their mission started out like any other mission. Boring. The only difference was that they met at the front gate and Kakashi actually showed up only ten minutes late. It was with anxiety that they tried to calm down the grouchy old bridge builder, who kept on threatening to take his money back.</p><p>Okay, Sakura was the only one worried. Sasuke wasn't a morning person, or an ever person really, and promptly announced that he didn't care where the old man 'shoved it'. Naruto seemed more interested at keeping to his depressed don't-wanna-talk-leave-me-alone thing.</p><p>It was, to every ones great surprise, Naruto who got Tazuna to stop whining.</p><p>"Look old man! Either wait here for our stupid teacher, or you can walk back to the water village by your damn self!" the blond finally snapped, the old man pushing his already straining buttons.</p><p>'Stupid bridge builders, stupid late teachers, and stupid, stupid, stupid demons!' Naruto thought as he glared at the Old man. Tazuna quieted, looking a little ill. Then Kakashi arrived. After a quick talk with the gate keeper, they were on their way.</p><p>For the first hour that they had been walking, Naruto was a pain in the ass.</p><p>"Are we there yet? I'm bored. Why are we going so slowly? How far is the village? Hey old man, do you have any kids? Kakashi-sensei, what's with the mask anyways? Are your hair colors naturally pink, silver, and blue? How come I don't have an unnatural cool hair color? It's really annoying how I don't have any cool unnatural thingy-a-bobs! Hey guys do you wear the same clothes every day---"</p><p>Twitch.</p><p>"Sakura-Chan have you ever been out of the village 'cause I haven't? What did you pack Sakura-Chan? Why is Kakashi-sensei in the back of the group? Hey bastard, do you think we'll fight any cool ninjas? What do you—"</p><p>Twitch. Twitch.</p><p>"-think will happen? I can't wait, how 'bout you Sakura-Chan?! I think this is going to be very cool! Are there any Ramen stands in your village old man? What—"</p><p><b>BAAAMMMMM CRACK</b></p><p>Finally, the questions ceased when Sakura swung her backpack at his head, sending the blond flying into a tree.</p><p>"SHUT UP YOU IDIOT!!"</p><p>"....."</p><p>"....."</p><p>"...."</p><p>The other three men stared at her nervously. All eyes were on her bag, wondering what the heck was in there.</p><p>"S..Sakura....." Sasuke asked nervously.</p><p>She gave them a look that told them to keep their mouths shut, even as she awkwardly maneuvered her backpack back to her back. It was clear her backpack was extremely heavy.</p><p>And so the journey began.</p><hr><p>Evilpinklollipop- SORRY FOR THE SHORT CHAPTER! ...but i ran out of time, ideas and patients. Sharing a computer with your mother is like sharing the last strawberry dipped in chocolate... It does not work. But don't worry, I'm gonna try to make the next chapter a lot longer in a lot shorter of a time!!
