A KyuuNaru Crackfic<br>
By: Rosethorn Li</b></p><p align="center"></p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>'<i>Delicious,
delectable little morsel…</i>'</p><p>"…uu-chan?
Kyuu-chan?" Impossibly blue eyes peer into his, owner temptingly
close.</p><p>'<i>Just
a little closer, and… (our lips would touch; devour…)</i>'</p><p>"Are
you alright, Kyuu-chan?" Uzumaki Naruto asked, concerned for his
boyfriend's state of mind. The man could space out at the weirdest
of times.</p><p>"A-ah.
I've fine," assured Youko Kyuubi, voice husky and rough. He half
purred, taking advantage of their close proximity to lean in, closer
to the appealing body heat. Mouth crooked in a smirk, expression
suggestively leering, made to speak sweet (<i>perverted</i>) nothings
in his little blonde's ear, when-</p><p>Naruto,
the oblivious idiot, turned away, breaking the redhead's
semi-strong hold with ease.</p><p>He
took a few steps away, back now to his partner, and surveyed the
floor. Piles upon piles of standard sized boxes crowded their new
home, pushed up against the walls or stacked hazardously as
waist-high islands in chaotic patterns across the room. None were
labeled.</p><p>Mostly
Naruto's things, Kyuubi's long devoured by time. Unfortunate,
since new furniture was required for a new house (the former fox
refused to have the smelly, worn pieces Naruto claimed as his from
the old apartment brought to their new).</p><p>"We
gotta get to work, datte'bayo!" Naruto got into a ready stance,
rolling up his shirt sleeves for effect.</p><p>Kyuubi
rolled his eyes. '<i>I thought I broke him of the habit to use that
fraise.</i>' It grated his nerves to hear 'datte'bayo'
constantly, even during their night time escapades. A few well placed
comments and 'punishments' later, and he thought he'd never
have it said again.</p><p>"I
bet I can unpack more than you," Naruto threw over his shoulder,
already bending down to move a few top boxes over. Straightening,
Kyuubi caught sight of the blonde's familiar fox grin quirking his
mouth in a way Youko Jr.-san wanted to see very differently.</p><p>Everything
was a competition to Naruto. Not that he minded; made for interesting
games.</p><p>"No
chance, mortal scum," the redhead shot back, smirk predatorial but
playful. "I'm better than you."</p><p>"Nuh-uh,"
denied Naruto, pouting in angry irritation. Cheeks a slight pink,
bottom lip jutted out, eyes bright ; '<i>tasty indeed</i>'.</p><p>Kyuubi
licked his lips, smirk widening into a feral, leering grin. "How
about we make this interesting?"</p><p>"Oh?"
Naruto leaned forward, interested, his gullible (now a rouse)
expression on.</p><p>"Say…
the loser gives the winner what he wants?" Anticipation curled in
the former fox's stomach. He waited to see if Naruto would take the
bait.</p><p>"Ah,"
the blonde agreed. "You are so on!"</p><p>Kyuubi's
triumphant smile was lost as the Jinchuuriki turned to the boxes and
attacked, throwing the contents every which way. Oozing confidence,
Naruto attacked with a triumphant smile on his face, mentally
declaring himself the victor.</p><p>He
didn't know better. Even having your love sealed inside you for
most of your life doesn't mean you know everything about that
person.</p><p>Time
slowed down before Kyuubi's eyes. Naruto looked like he was
trudging through water, movements exuberant but lacking speed.</p><p>'<i>When
I win, I'll have in on his knees,</i>' thought the fox,
continuing off into X-rated thoughts as he set to work. It was so
simple: open a box, walk leisurely around the apartment, setting up
the contents in appropriate places, then moving on to the next
cardboard container. '<i>I have already won.</i>'</p><p>His
thoughts mirrored Naruto's, too caught up in his enthusiastic
contend-brawling to notice Kyuubi's excellent progress. Great minds
(or those similarly focused) think alike.</p><p>They
unpacked a multitude of boxes, not everything but enough to have
found items ranging from a threadbare frog plushy to a box set of
brand-new rainbow colored markers. With nothing really having a
decided place, the apartment was cluttered with gutted box content
left vaguely in a direction it seemed to fit. Naruto's were thrown,
scattered near and far but in the direction of the room/area,
Kyuubi's sitting neatly in piles or lines, depending upon the item.</p><p>Naruto
took one look at this and huffed, sitting angrily on the only clear
spot (the couch), arms crossed, head turned, and posture tense.
Kyuubi attempted to cuddle beside him, getting only so far with an
unwilling body.</p><p>In
a last ditch effort, he wrapped his arms around the blonde and
forcefully tugged the teen against his chest. Naruto let out a
squawked cry of protested, quickly silenced by an urgent mouth
seeking his.</p><p>"C'mon,
I won," Kyuubi murmured against a slackened jaw, his blonde lax and
gulping for breathe against him. Nuzzling closer, he nipped at
Naruto's sensitive ears. The boy squirmed, gasped protest turning
into a moan, and Kyuubi smirked against his neck, nipping at the
junction between throat and shoulder.</p><p>"Kyuubi,"
the captive blonde whined, ending fading into an appreciative noise.
A slick tongue ran against the curve of his jaw, distracting and
scrambling his thoughts into pleasured mush.</p><p>Kyuubi
turned him, pushing Naruto back-down into the couch, continuing his
ministrations with devout attention. A true smile, so very rare,
tugged at the edges of his mouth-</p><p>Until
Naruto, again, pushed him away and darted to their bedroom.</p><p>Perplexed,
Kyuubi lay in a dazed sprawl, blinking eyes clouded in denied
satisfaction and confusion.</p><p>"Well?"
came from the bedroom. Naruto appeared in the doorway, waving a
familiar bottle tantalizingly. "Isn't this what you want?"</p><p>"Oh,<i>yes</i>," Kyuubi purred, following the turning blonde.</p><p>The
door closed with a slam, sudden noise vibrating through their messy
apartment.</p><p>They
didn't get much sleep that night.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>
