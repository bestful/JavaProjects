<div style='margin-top:2px'>Gensei. It means sacrifice. It's what I am, a fox sacrife. It's an honor to be chosen, apparently. I'm a substitute for one much greater, the clan head, the Kyuubi. I hate the guy. Stuck here in my cage that's meant for a giant, life has lost meaning. Can the blonde brat that looks like the one who tried to stop the boss change that. I doubt it. Yaoi, M for gore, swearing and sex.</div>

As it happens fate saw fit to open the heavens and let the rain pour to mask the tears on my face. Oh well. Not that it matters anyway. I've gone through far worse than a little water. Yesterday's beating for example. It was particularly bad, they had hospitalised me, as usual. Three broken ribs, a concussion, puncture and slash wounds ,infected of course and to top it all of my entrails where hanging out of my stomach from a chakra scalpel. And the funny bit? Released the following evening. Hilarious right? Haaa haa haaaa ha ha-ha. funny, but it frigging hurt, hurt like hell. Hahahahaha.</p><p>"Demon, demon brat, nine tailed, fox bitch and my personal favourite Kyuubi whore!" That's what Jiji calls me, self righteous bastard he is. So here I am sitting under the old willow in the academy yard, a familiar scene. This is where I come to listen to the hushed hate gossip that the other children's mothers think I can't hear and wollow in self pity. Haaahahaahahaha. Jokes on them. You see, unlike the other pathetic brats that come to this polluted cess pool known as the academy, with its idiotic students and equally idiotic teachers. I am not dumb. When someone called me the Kyuubi and told me to be ashamed of possessing the little boy I was sealed in, it didn't,t take a genius to figure out what had happened.</p><p>They had burned down my apartment earlier, not surprising, they always get bolder on my birthday for whatever reason. I was tired and cold and hungry and a multitude of other unpleasant things that I won't mention. The wisest option for relieving the pain was obvious, sleep. So I slept, deep and long. Not my smartest move In retrospect.</p><p>When I awoke, I found my self in a rusty sewer with pipes lining the walls and waste water knee deep. Joy. Everything was bathed in a green light that had no apparent source. Luminous fungi or something. The low corridor faded into darkness in either direction." Inie meany miney moe, catch a ba... Screw it. That direction." Procrastinating sucks so I don't do it. It was getting darker as I walked onwards until pitch black. perfect. Dark equals spiders and spiders equals legs and freak me out, especially if there are shoes attached. I hate shoes. So I wear sandels like most shinobi do. Anywaaay... Dark right, the blackness exploded into the dim lighting from before. I was in a long mainly featureless room with a high ceiling and a large cage type door of golden colour instead of a wall at the far end. Why was there a Cage there? It was about four stories tall with a little piece of paper in the middle that had seal written on it in kangi.</p><p>There was no colossal creature in it, not that I am complaining. Giant caged creatures are I usually a little pissed when disturbed. Trust me I have met Gamabunta and he wasn't caged. Quite cautiously, I approached the bars and slipped through the five meter gaps. It was dark in the cage but not the normal type of darkness. It was like a fog swirling and shifting on invisible tides, it was almost tangible. I could feel it sapping at my strength making me tired, yet another feature for restraining large caged beasts, interesting. I had begun to speculate as to where I was but I was waiting for more proof before making asumptions.</p><p>Twin beams of red light penetrated the gloom, little tiny pinprick small. They were in the corner of the cage there source hidden by the black mist. I, being an idiot, walked towards them to investigate ( I was seven, cut me a break.) in the corner was a surprise. I was expecting some sort of hidious mutant. But what I found was a very thin, very vulnerable, very nude seven year old boy with deep crimson hair.</p><p>Piercing red eyes looked up at me, blood shot and sore from crying. "Go away" he snarled, it wasn't scary or threatening, it just sounded sad and defeated. He then proceeded to bury his face in his shaking knees. Joy. Sighing I sat down beside him and draped my tattered orange( shudder) jacket about his shoulders. "Name.." Nothing "come on kid say something". A snort followed this" I am older than you by about 200 years, kid" he barked sarcastically. " oh so it talks now, so it can tell me it's name" I suggested playfully twiddling my eye brows. it looked at me angrily, noting my triumphant smirk. It looked down, blushing. " mmmmnmnb" it mumbled unintelligently. "Pardon." It stared at me. " Gesei" it mumbled slightly louder. " Well, Gesei it's nice to meet you. My name is Naruto Uzumaki and we will be seeing a lot of each other" I said sadisticaly. Gesei just gulped.</p><p><b>Ta-da. First chapter done, gesei is an OC for all those who can't figure that out. The pairing is NaruGes, naruto seme, gensei uke, obviously. I am considering a kakashi x iruka as a sub-pairing, mabey. Tell me what you want people. This is my first ever fanfic so please don't be harsh. Constructive criticism is welcomed. Flames will be ignored so don't bother. Feel free to make requests but remember I can't do them all.
