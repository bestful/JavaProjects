gonna go fuck C.C., and you can't. How does that make you feel?</P><P>Chief:....... Damn
you......</P><P>__________________________________________________________________</P><P>(Quick note, Naruto and
the Rookie 9 are all 18, they all are also wearing the clothes they
have in Shippuden, well not Naruto himself of course, he gets
different clothes)</P><P>It was September 22th,
Kakashi Hatake, Sakura Haruno, Sasuke Uchiha, and Neji Hyuga were
sent on an S-rank mission.</P><P>Their mission was to
retrieve a certain Naruto Uzamaki after being missing for 3 years.</P><P>He was reported to be
going to a major city with several other people in a strange bus.</P><P>The bus had the word
'Disturbed' on it, and featured a figure smiling evilly while being
burned.</P><P>Their guess that he was
going to a concert where a band named Disturbed was performing on the
10th.</P><P>They were told to
investigate, and if they found him in the city they were bring him
back, with force if necessary.</P><P>*October 10th, 9:44pm*</P><P>The shinobi team were
walking down a street heading to the Disturbed concert.</P><P>The night was still and
cold, with the moon shining brightly. However no one noticed it since
the buildings all had their lights on with cars passing every second.</P><P>They all went to an
alleyway so no one could see that they created tickets.</P><P>They each made a shadow
clone and transformed them into tickets. The exited soon and
continued towards the concert.</P><P>It was silent until Sakura
spoke up, "Even if goes to this concert how will we find him?
There should be like thousands there."</P><P>"Thats why we have
Neji with us, he can use his Byakugan and find him in the crowd."
Kakashi replied in his monotone voice.</P><P>"Yeah but even with
his Byakugan could he really find Naruto among thousands of people?"
Sakura asked.</P><P>"I'm pretty confident
that I will be able to spot him, after all he has the Kyubii's chakra
so it he would stick out among everyone else." Neji replied.</P><P>"Why the hell would
he go to a concert like this in the first place? What kind of music
would he listen to?" Sasuke asked.</P><P>"I think they call
this music 'Heavy Metal' or something." Kakashi replied.</P><P>"Well thats a strange
name for a type of music." Sakura said.</P><P>"Indeed it is."
agreed Neji.</P><P>"Wonder what it
sounds like?" asked Sasuke.</P><P>"Well it involves
guitars that use electricity to power them, drums, and singers from
what I hear." Neji stated, as if he was an expert.</P><P>"Guitars that use
electricity?" asked Sakura.</P><P>"Well if your all
done talking, were here." said Kakashi. They looked up in
surprise to see the concert building.</P><P>They soon got in the long
line and eventually 20 minutes later they reached the entrance.</P><P>"Tickets please,"
said a large man wearing black pants, a black shirt and white
sneakers.</P><P>They all handed them their
fake tickets and proceeded to performance hall.</P><P>They all stood near the
back while Neji activated his Byakugan, searching for any trace of
Naruto. His eyes kept shifting back and forth until he looked towards
the stage.</P><P>He gasped as he turned off
the Byakugan.</P><P>"What is it Neji?"
asked a worried Sakura.</P><P>Before he could answer the
audience screamed even louder. They looked at the stage and found the
band there coming out of the stage through a trap door with smoke.</P><P>When they reached the top
of the stage the group got a good look at who was there in front of
them.</P><P>The lead vocalist had
spiky blond hair covered by a hood and darkened blue eyes. He wore a
black sleeveless jacket over a black tank top, he also had a pair of
black pants with six pockets on each leg.</P><P>He wore black combat boots
with iron straps. How they were sure it was him was the necklace
Tsunade gave him around his neck. However there was another one there
as well.</P><P>It was silver and had a
very intricate emblem. (The symbol from Disturbed's album Believe)</P><P>They knew that they
couldn't take him now with so many people.</P><P>"My god," is all
Kakashi could say.</P><P>"N-Naruto?" is
all Sakura could say.</P><P>"No way," is all
Neji could say.</P><P>Sasuke didn't say
anything, he just stood there with his eyes wide and his jaw slack.</P><P>"We have to leave and
report this now." Kakashi said in a more serious voice than
earlier.</P><P>"Wait," they
stared at Sakura.</P><P>"I want to find out
how his music sounds like." was the only excuse she could think
of.</P><P>"One song and we
leave." replied Kakashi sternly.</P><P>(Cue song 'Guarded' by
Disturbed)</P><P><B>"GUARDING YOURSELF
FROM THE LOVE OF ANOTHER, LEFT YOU WITH NOTHING TONIGHT!"</B></P><P>Sakura covered her ears as
to how loud it was.</P><P><B>"WHY DOES IS IT
SOUND LIKE THE DEVIL IS LAUGHING, LEAVING ME HAUNTED TONIGHT!"</B></P><P>Neji winced at the level
of sound.</P><P><B>"YOU DID
DECIDE!!!"</B></P><P>Kakashi stood like nothing
happened but frowned.</P><P><I><B>"Now I want
you, when you're gone, and now it's like, you're holding something
just in front of me."</B></I></P><P><B>"Well then, I
can't allow this to become another, one of those times that I'm left
in the cold, dead, THERES NO COMPROMISE!"</B></P><P><B>"JUST ANOTHER TIE,
I KNOW I, need to sever.."</B></P><P>Sasuke winced at the last
words, remembering what he said to him at the Valley of The End.</P><P><B>"GUARDING YOURSELF
FROM THE LOVE OF ANOTHER, LEFT YOU WITH NOTHING TONIGHT!"</B></P><P><B>"WHY DOES IT SOUND
LIKE THE DEVIL IS LAUGHING, LEAVING ME HAUNTED TONIGHT!"</B></P><P><B>"YOU DID
DECIDE!!!"</B></P><P><I><B>"Ever haunted
by the trappings of this life, sweet redemption just in front of me."</B></I></P><P><B>"Well now it seems
once again that I've lost lost another, One of the ones who have
broke through the wall, damned, FATE WON'T COMPROMISE!"</B></P><P><B>"</B><B>I
HAVE SOLD MY SOUL AND NOW THE, devil's laughing.."</B></P><P><B>"YOU DID
DECIDE!!!"</B></P><P><B>"YOU WERE BOLD AND
STRONG AND READY, TO BEGIN YOUR LIFE. ALL FOR NOTHING, YOU WERE
SACRIFICED!"</B></P><P><B>"YOU BEGAN ALONE
AND SO IT, WILL BE WHEN YOU DIE."</B></P><P><B>"ALL FOR NOTHING,
WILL YOU BE REMEMBERED?"</B></P><P><B>"YOU DID
DECIDE!!!"</B></P><P><B>"GUARDING YOURSELF
FROM THE LOVE OF ANOTHER, LEFT YOU WITH NOTHING TONIGHT!"</B></P><P><B>"SO NOW YOU KNOW
WHY THE DEVIL IS LAUGHING, HE LEFT YOU WITH NOTHING TONIGHT!"</B></P><P><B>"YOU DID
DECIDE!!!"</B></P><P>The crowd cheered even
louder as the song ended.</P><P>Sakura was still covering
her ears but still heard every sound and word.</P><P>Neji and Kakashi only
frowned.</P><P>Sasuke stared at Naruto on
the stage while thinking.</P><P><I>'What the hell was that
dobe?' Sasuke thought.</I></P><P>Before
the next song began they shun-shined out of the building.</P><P>They were on top of a
building a couple blocks away.</P><P>"What the heck was
that?" Sakura asked as she rubbed her ears.</P><P>"Well you wanted to
stay and hear it." stated Neji.</P><P>"Yeah but now I think
I might have hearing problems now because of that." said Sakura
still rubbing her ears.</P><P>"We better report
this to Tsunade right away." said a stern Kakashi.</P><P>"What did you think
Sasuke?" asked Sakura seeming to recover from the music.</P><P>"Hmph," was the
only reply Sasuke gave.</P><P>*At Naruto's hotel room.
After concert*</P><P>Naruto made his way to his
hotel room. He opened the door and settled on to the red couch in the
middle of the room.</P><P>He sat down and sighed
heavily. He heard footsteps behind him.</P><P>Two feminine arms wrapped
around his neck while a redheaded women kissed him on the cheek.</P><P>"So, how did it go?"
asked the redheaded women in a comforting voice.</P><P>"Great, but something
didn't feel right. I felt like I was being watched." Naruto
replied.</P><P>"There were ten
thousand people there, of course you were being watched silly."
she said in a playful tone.</P><P>"No, like someone I
knew was watching me, I think, I think they might have found me."
Naruto said in a growingly tense voice.</P><P>"Why would they be
here?" she said trying to comfort the ex-shinobi/rock star.</P><P>"I don't know, maybe
I'm being paranoid." he said calming down while nine red tails
with white tips started to massage his neck.</P><P>"Thats better, now
come on to bed, I have a birthday present I know you'll enjoy."
she said seductively.</P><P>"Happy birthday to
me." he said while smiling.</P><P>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>Chief: Still want to kill
me Naruto?</P><P>Naruto: Depends, you
haven't described her yet.</P><P>Chief: Trust me, you'll
like it.</P><P>Naruto: Oh, and why did
you stop before I got laid? It's not fair ya bastard!</P><P>Chief: Hey, you'll get
laid in PROTO-FOX and this story so shut up.</P><P>Naruto: Are you sure?</P><P>Chief: Hey I don't pay you
to question my Chiefy ways!</P><P>Naruto: Whatever....</P><P>Chief: Thats right
whatever. <I>Ungrateful prick....</I></P><P>Naruto: What was that?</P><P>Chief: Nothing.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Demon's Blood</P><P>Chapter 2: Making Plans<p></P><P>Chief: Well ladies and gentlemen here is chapter 2 an-</P><P>Naruto: Seriously are you ever going to describe me having sex?</P><P>Chief: Why are you so worried about that?</P><P>Naruto: Because I have never been laid as far as the real story arc
goes.</P><P>Chief: Alright I'll explain it in another chapter.</P><P>Naruto: Good, god knows I need some poon.</P><P>Chief: ........ What is wrong with you?</P><P>Naruto: Don't know.</P><P>Akemi: Naruto! Please come back to bed.</P><P>Naruto: Hehe, sorry I gotta go. <I>Time for some more fun.</I></P><P>Chief: DAMN! UNDONE BY MY OWN CREATION! DAMN IT, DAMN IT, DAMN IT!!!
(lol robot chicken reference)</P><P>Chief: Oh, I'm making some of the other band members characters from
another anime, they will be explained some other time, also the
Kyubii's name is Akemi, meaning bright and beautiful.</P><P>Chief: SEQUENCE INITIATE!!!</P><P>___________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>*Inside Naruto's hotel room, October 11th, 7:23am*</P><P>Naruto awoke in his hotel bed with a comforting weight on chest.</P><P>He found Akemi on top of him, naked.</P><P>Her hair was as red as blood, shimmering in the light from the
window.</P><P>She had a slim figure with above 'average' size breasts and a nice
round rear.</P><P>All in all, she was a sight to behold.</P><P>He woke her up soft kiss, "Wake up sleepy." he said.</P><P>She fluttered her eyes open to have her deep crimson eyes meet with
his sparkling ocean blue eyes.</P><P>"Good morning Naruto," she said softly.</P><P>*At Konoha, 8:30am*</P><P>Tsunade was rubbing her temples furiously.</P><P>"So you say his chakra was different how?"</P><P>She was speaking to the shinobi team that had seen Naruto in his
concert.</P><P>"Well lady Tsunade Naruto's chakra was inhuman, but what is
troubling is that its not the Kyubii's own chakra, it was something
else," said none other than Neji.</P><P>"Is it a different presence in his body?" she asked.</P><P>The Hyuga shook his head. "No, its his own chakra, its not even
demonic, its something beyond that," Neji explained.</P><P>"I see, well is there anything else that any of you need to
say?" she asked.</P><P>They all shook their heads.</P><P>"Well then, you are dismissed." with that said all but
Kakashi left.</P><P>"What is it Kakashi?" she asked.</P><P>"Lady Tsunade, I have an idea that could lure Naruto here,"
Kakashi said in his monotone but serious voice.</P><P>Said Hokage raised an eyebrow, "What do you have in mind
Kakashi?"</P><P>"Simple, we get his band to perform here and we take him
afterwards." he said in the same tone.</P><P>"I see, but won't he be suspicious that the village after him
asked him to go there, even if for his job?" she said.</P><P>"Thats why I propose that we ask other bands to play here as
well. If we make it seem like a music festival he will be more
inclined to come." he said.</P><P>"Hmmm..... Interesting, it might work." she said.</P><P>"Shall we prepare then?" he asked, hoping she would say
yes.</P><P>"Alright, we'll have this music festival, I'll make for some
D-rank missions to help prepare for this. Thank god we have gennin
doing free labor for missions."</P><P>Kakashi nodded, "So, shall I spread the word?"</P><P>"Yes Kakashi, we also need some people going around the nations
telling them of this, we need it to seem like a genuine festival."
she stated.</P><P>"Yes Hokage-sama." He then shun-shined outside of the
Hokage Tower.</P><P>"I wonder how Naruto's music sounds like?" asked a curious
Shizune who was standing next to the Hokage.</P><P>"I'm going to buy earmuffs, from what they told me, it's gonna
be loud for sure." Tsunade said.</P><P>*Home of the Band, October 14th, 6:52pm*</P><P>Naruto was at the bands house, (His house), he was in the game room
of the house.</P><P>The game room was a floor down from the entrance of the house.</P><P>It was a large room with black walls with a white rug floor.</P><P>It had a black reflective fridge with nothing in it but energy drinks
and Gatorade.</P><P>It had a red couch with black lining on it in the middle of the room.</P><P>There were huge speakers on the wall in front of the couch with an HD
plasma screen TV above them hanging on the wall.</P><P>Connected to them both was an Xbox 360 and a PS3.</P><P>Keeping the room illuminated were circular lights on the ceilings
lined up on the sides like a movie theater.</P><P>Right now he was playing a Halo 3 online Slayer match with the bands
lead guitarist and his close friend, Lelouch Lamprouge.</P><P>"Shit were's the sniper rifle," asked Naruto, 'Getting his
Game On'. (God that sounded gay)</P><P>"Crap its gone, I think that guy ha- Shit." Lelouch was
sniped in the head by the weapon they were looking for.</P><P>"Ha, you got owned." said Naruto mocking him.</P><P>"Shut up, I still got more kills than you." Lelouch
retorted, trying to sound like he won the argument.</P><P>"Your just mad cause you can't get a single kill whenever
someones sniping your panzy a- Fuck." His mimicking was short
lived when 'someone' stuck him with a plasma grenade.</P><P>"Who's laughing now?" Lelouch said triumphantly.</P><P>Naruto only growled.</P><P>He was about to make another attempt to ague but was stopped by
Gaara, the bands bass guitarist. (He will be explained at the end of
the chapter)</P><P>Gaara walked up to them both followed by their drummer, Suzaku.</P><P>"Hey guys," said Gaara and Suzaku entering the room.</P><P>Naruto and Lelouch were to focused on their game they just said 'hi'
or 'hey'.</P><P>"Guys we're being asked to play in a village named Konoha.
Theres a music festival happening in a seven months and they want us
to be there to play." explained Suzaku.</P><P>Naruto dropped his controller. Everyone stared at him. Suzaku and
Lelouch were clueless, however Gaara knew.</P><P>Naruto's expression was blank, his head swelled with memories of his
village, the pain and suffering he had endured, it was catching up to
him.</P><P>The beatings, the chasing, the betrayal. It was slowly and painfully
going back into his head.</P><P>"Naruto, I understand if you don't want to go," said
Gaara.</P><P>"Why wouldn't he want to go?" asked Suzaku.</P><P>"Bad memories, thats all," replied a cold, serious Naruto.</P><P>"Naruto, if you don't feel like going we won't do man,"
said Lelouch trying to comfort him.</P><P>"No, its alright, if you guys want to, we go." said Naruto,
starting to sound like himself again.</P><P>"Alright then we go!" exclaimed an excited Suzaku.</P><P>*Naruto's Bedroom, 9:22pm*</P><P>Naruto was in his bed, thinking.</P><P>How could he go back there, after what they did to him. How his
closest friends betrayed him.</P><P>He shook those thoughts away, he had better friends now, ones that
understood him.</P><P>He most importantly had Akemi with him, what more could he ask for?</P><P>His train of thoughts were interrupted when Akemi came onto the bed
with him.</P><P>"Your worried about something. Whats the matter?" she asked
in a caring yet playful tone.</P><P>"We're going to perform in Konoha in seven months." he
stated coldly.</P><P>She sighed, "Naruto, are you sure you want to go? We don't have
to," she said in a less playful and more concerning voice.</P><P>"I'm sure, I can handle it."</P><P>"But what if you can't? What if they find out and you lose
control of yourself?" she said.</P><P>"I won't lose control, I never have." he said.</P><P>"Not yet you haven't, what if you lose yourself this time?"</P><P>"I control it, its part of me now, it will obey me." he
said reassuring her.</P><P>"Alright, you won't lose control of it, but what if they find
out? What if they keep coming after you?" she asked.</P><P>"They won't. I'll make sure of it." he said in a confident
tone.</P><P>"But what if-" she was cut off by him.</P><P>"Why are you so worried? What is it that would make you so
worried?" he asked.</P><P>"Well, remember back at the hotel three days ago?" she
asked.</P><P>"Yeah, we had sex, what else." he said.</P><P>"Well I didn't feel well so I went to the doctor and they found
out what it was." she said.</P><P>"What?!" he said getting worried.</P><P>"Well, I'm pregnant." she said.</P><P>________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>Chief: Aw, ain't I a bastard?</P><P>Naruto: ........ I'm going to fucking kill you.......</P><P>Chief: Come on man, I'l describe the sex as a flashback, how about
that?</P><P>Naruto: ........ Fine........</P><P>Chief: Good, now *Activates Geass* DIE!</P><P>Lelouch: Thats not going to work, he's built up an immunity to it.</P><P>Chief: .... Oh...... Well..... Fuck......</P><P>________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>Explanation of Gaara</P><P>In this fic, Gaara did have Shukaku removed like in the series, but
instead he did not become Kazekage, his sister Temari did. And so he
joined Naruto's band afterwards since he didn't want to be Kazekage.
So he left his sister with the responsibility of it and he left.
Thats it.</P><P>Lelouch and Suzaku will be explained some other time. I feel lazy
right now so ha.</P><P>________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>Chief: The Real Master Chief signing off!</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Demon's Blood</P><P>Chapter 3: Welcome to a Mad World</P><P>Chief: So Naruto, how's Akemi now that she's pregnant?</P><P>Naruto: Very moody, plus she eats more than me now that
she eats for herself and the baby. *sigh*</P><P>Chief: ........... Thats how baby's eat when their

legal license to own me.</P><P>Chief: True, but I'm writing this, I can make you do
anything I want you to!</P><P>Naruto: You wouldn't.</P><P>Chief: Watch me.</P><P>_______________________________________________________________________</P><P>"I IZ AN IDIOT!" exclaimed Naruto dumbly in a
southern accent.</P><P>_______________________________________________________________________</P><P>Naruto: Huh, huh, huh, WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT!!!</P><P>Chief: This is my fic, here, I AM A GOD!!!</P><P>Naruto: Oh god help me!-</P><P>Chief: GOD CAN'T HELP YOU NOW!

hidden by a spandex mask*</P><P>Naruto: Oh god.....</P><P>(lol, Awesome Gaiden reference)</P><P>Chief: How was that?</P><P>Naruto: Okay, note to self, never question Chief's
authority. Ever.</P><P>__________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>*Konoha, May 3rd, bands perform in 1 day, 5:34pm*</P><P>Konoha was once again filled with busy streets because
of the festival.</P><P>People from all over the nations came.</P><P>They each came either to see all the bands or just a
few. Either way there were thousands.</P><P>In preparation of this, Konoha made an entire new part
of the village before they started sending word of the festival.</P><P>It was outside the wall of Konoha but from a birds eye
view it seemed to be a another part of the village.</P><P>The new area had tall apartment buildings covering most
of it. There were three concert halls made for three performances at
once.</P><P>Building the area had cost a great deal of money,
however the revenue paid far more than the building cost.</P><P>Since many people came they paid for all the businesses
and charge of the hotels.</P><P>It was so good for the village's economy the council
decided to keep it and have this festival every year.</P><P>However for the Hokage that meant more paperwork around
this time of year then.</P><P>Tsunade was in her office, but was not frustrated.</P><P>She was lying down on the couch in her office drinking
while three shadow clones did her paperwork.</P><P>"Now I see why Naruto loved this jutsu so much."
she said happily.</P><P>"Lady Tsunade isn't this kinda, well, lazy of you?"
said Sakura who standing next to Shizune near said Hokage.</P><P>"Calm down Sakura, this isn't much of a big deal."
she said.</P><P>"Well its tha-" she was cut short when Neji
rushed in.</P><P>"Lady Tsunade! Naruto and his band have arrived at
their hotel!" he said in between pants.</P><P>Tsunade straightened up and stood.</P><P>"Alright, call in Sasuke Uchiha and Kakashi Hatake,
NOW!" she yelled.</P><P>"Yes Tsunade-sama." Neji said and shun-shined
away.</P><P>During the preparations for the festival, Tsunade had
chosen Naruto's former teammates to try and convince him to stay.</P><P>Since they knew him and his techniques he would be taken
down easy if they had to fight him.</P><P>Before she could think anymore Sasuke and Kakashi
shun-shined into the office.</P><P>"We're here Hokage-sama." said a focused
Kakashi.</P><P>"Good, now then, I want you to go to Naruto's hotel
and get him into my office. If necessary bring him back by force."
she said.</P><P>"Yes Hokage-sama!" said Sakura, Sasuke and
Kakashi. After that they shun-shined away to the hotel.</P><P><I>'Naruto, please listen to them. I don't want them to
hurt you.' she thought.<BR></I><p></P><P>*Naruto's Hotel, 5:39pm*</P><P>Naruto was in the hotel living room watching TV with the
rest of the band and Akemi.</P><P>"So Naruto, whats gonna be the name of the baby?"
Lelouch asked.</P><P>"If its a boy then Ryuu, if its a girl then
Kushina." he said.</P><P>"Not after me? Come on, I'm gonna be the greatest
uncle ever and you won't name him after me?" Lelouch asked,
feeling hurt.</P><P>"Are you questioning my ability to pick my own
baby's name?" asked Akemi growing angrier by the second.</P><P>Lelouch and the rest started to panic.</P><P>Whenever Akemi got mad it was like the Apocalypse.</P><P>When she got mad when she was pregnant was Hell on
earth.</P><P>Lelouch was sweating bullets and was thinking fast.</P><P><I>'Holy shit, this is worse than when Suzaku had to
stab me during the Zero Requiem!' he thought remembering that
day. </I>(Final episode of Code Geass)</P><P>In Lelouch's mind was a chibi version of him and Suzaku.
The chibi Suzaku turned into chibi Zero and took a sword and stabbed
Lelouch, who's eyes turned into on large X on his face.</P><P>"W-well I just thought tha-" he was cut off by
her.</P><P>"Thought what?" she asked while cracking her
knuckles.</P><P>"N-nothing!" he said, trying to get her to
forgive him.</P><P>"Okay!" she said happily and walked back to
the couch next to Naruto again.</P><P>The rest were scared out of their minds when she talked
like that.</P><P>But Naruto, throughout this all was sitting there like
nothing happened either.</P><P>It was seven months ago when Naruto found out Akemi was
pregnant with his child.</P><P>Needless to say he was surprised. But it also made him
the happiest man on earth.</P><P>After she told him they both planned out everything for
the baby.</P><P>They thought about names, picked out clothes, and got
everything they would need for a baby.</P><P>Since Lelouch pestered them so much about naming it
after him they threatened to make Lelouch's room into the baby's.</P><P>The reason? Because Akemi was pregnant, her tolerance
level decreased drastically.</P><P>If a fly bothered her, she would use a fire jutsu to
completely fry it.</P><P>Doing so always creeped the living hell out of everyone.</P><P>Even though she was a grouch most of the time, whenever
she was with Naruto she could care less about anything else.</P><P>There was knock on the door.</P><P>Naruto got up from his seat and went to open it.</P><P>He wasn't prepared for what he saw.</P><P>It was his former team.</P><P>Kakashi, Sakura, and Sasuke. All standing across from
him.</P><P>They stared at each other, neither saying a word.</P><P>Naruto's breathing was becoming harder.</P><P><I>'What? No, not now! I thought I had it under control!
Calm down, your just a little freaked out calm down.' he thought to
himself.</I></P><P>Sakura broke the silence, "Naruto? Is that you?"
she asked.</P><P>"What the hell do you want?" he
asked/demanded.</P><P>Everyone else saw who it was.</P><P>Lelouch pulled out a katana as did Suzaku, while Gaara's
sand was starting to swirl.</P><P>Akemi was sitting there.</P><P>She knew who it was. She didn't want to put stress on
herself.</P><P>But she was still connected to Naruto on a mental and
emotional link. She felt his feelings.</P><P>"Calm down, we just want to talk." said
Kakashi in his signature monotone voice.</P><P>"Talking's overrated, tell me what you want!"
he demanded, getting angrier by the second.</P><P>"Naruto, please! Just listen, let us explain!"
yelled Sakura.</P><P>Naruto's eye's were starting to turn red.</P><P>"Explain what? Explain how you broke my heart?"
he said to her. Sakura's looked down.</P><P>"Or you," he said looking to Sasuke, "Explain
why you stabbed me with two fucking chidori's in my chest!" he
yelled.</P><P>Sasuke started to feel a small amount of regret, only a
small amount.</P><P>"Or maybe you," he said looking to Kakashi.</P><P>"Explain why you only trained Sasuke and didn't
give a rat's ass about what happened to me, you even said I wasn't
worth your time!" he said to his former sensei coldly.</P><P>Kakashi only sighed.</P><P>"Don't explain anything, I don't need your crap. I
have a better life now, let me live it in peace."</P><P>"Damn it Naruto! Just listen!" yelled Sasuke,
getting angrier as well.</P><P>"NO! I HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR BULLSHIT! I DON'T
NEE-" he was cut short when he heard Akemi moaning in pain.</P><P>"N-Naruto, I-I think my water just broke." she
said.</P><P>Naruto's eyes widened.</P><P>"Holy crap! Come one guys we have to get her to the
hospital!" yelled Suzaku, helping her up.</P><P>The shinobi outside the door were only stunned at the
thought.</P><P><I>'Naruto, got a girl pregnant?!' the shinobi thought
simultaniosly.</I></P><P>Naruto was already lifting her up and shun-shined to the
hospital.</P><P>Gaara did the same while Lelouch and Suzaku were there
starting to leave.</P><P>"God damn it, why are we the ones that have to
walk?" asked Suzaku.</P><P>"They have to teach us that." said an angry
Lelouch.</P><P>With those two running out of the hotel, Team Kakashi
was just standing there.</P><P>Sakura felt somewhat betrayed.</P><P>Sasuke was just wide eyed.</P><P>Kakashi's eye was twitching.</P><P>*Konoha Hospital, 6:12pm*</P><P>Naruto was holding up Akemi when he shun-shined outside
the hospital.</P><P>He helped her inside and yelled, "HEY! SOMEBODY
HELP!"</P><P>His response was several doctors and nurses, with
Tsunade at the front of them.</P><P>Her eyes widened. It was Naruto.</P><P>She was brought out of her stupor when he said, "Yeah
don't mind her, she's just HAVING A BABY!" he yelled.</P><P>She and the other doctors quickly helped her and brought
her to a bed.</P><P>They moved her to a room and started the procedure.</P><P>Naruto was there right by her.</P><P>She gripped his hand tightly.</P><P>It was probably tight enough to crush solid steel. But
Naruto was stronger than steel. Literally.</P><P>He was probably stronger than Chucktanium. (lol)</P><P>________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>Naruto: .......... Chucktanium?</P><P>Chief: You know, what Chuck Norris is made of.</P><P>Naruto: Well, can't argue with that logic.</P><P>________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>It was probably tight enough to crush solid steel. But
Naruto was stronger than steel. Literally.</P><P>It didn't matter to him if he was stronger than steel,
what mattered to him was that he was here for her now.</P><P>*After the delivery...... What?....... Fuck you, I don't
want to detail how a baby is born. Its nasty*</P><P>"Its a boy," said Tsunade.</P><P>Akemi was on the hospital bed, more tired than she ever
was in her life.</P><P>She had just gone through bringing a new life into this
world.</P><P>Tsunade, wearing gloves and a doctor mask had finished
with the baby.</P><P>(Cue 'Mad World' by Gary Jules)</P><P>She wrapped it in a blanket and gave it to Akemi.</P><P>"Look Naruto, a beautiful baby boy." Akemi
said in a weak voice.</P><P>Naruto could only stare in awe at what he saw.</P><P>His own son. A beautiful son right in front of him,
being held in his mother's arms.</P><P>Akemi was holding the baby against herself.</P><P>"Wouldn't you want to hold your son?" she
asked.</P><P>He didn't say anything, he only reached out with his
arms.</P><P>She slowly placed the baby in his arms.</P><P>He held him gently.</P><P>He looked at his small, glowing face.</P><P>He had blonde hair, purple eyes that sparkled in the
light (Combination of blue and red), and three whisker marks on each
cheek.</P><P>He looked just like him. He was so proud that words
could not have described it.</P><P>He brought him up to his shoulders. His son slowly
breathing tiny breaths into his ears.</P><P>He whispered to him, slowly, his first words to his son.</P><P>"Welcome, my son, to this mad, mad world." he
said while smiling.</P><P>His son yawned into his ear.</P><P>He placed gave him back to his mother gently.</P><P>She smiled at the boy.</P><P>"Hello, my little Ryuu." she said smiling.</P><P>Tsunade could only smile.</P><P><I>'At least, now, he's happy.' she thought.</I></P><P>*Konoha Hospital, May 4th, 6:04am*</P><P>Naruto was standing on top of the hospital looking at
the sunrise, thinking.</P><P>The way the sky turned colors just seemed to relax him.</P><P>He was thinking back to when he left Konoha.</P><P>The betrayal he had suffered was in his mind.</P><P>He hit the chain link fence in front him. The memory was
getting stronger.</P><P>"Damn it!" he yelled, but not loud enough for
people to hear him.</P><P>The memory was becoming even stronger. He started to
feel pain in his chest.</P><P>"Sasuke, get your ass out of the damn shadows, I
know your there." he said.</P><P>Sasuke's eyes widened. How could he have detected him?
He completely hid his chakra signature.</P><P>He shook it off and appeared a few meters behind Naruto.</P><P>"What the hell do you want?" Naruto
asked/demanded without even turning around.</P><P>"Fight me." Sasuke said.</P><P>This did not catch Naruto off by surprise, he had
expected it.</P><P>"I don't need to kill you, just stay out of my
way." Naruto said coldly.</P><P>"Whats wrong dobe? Afraid?" Sasuke said with a
smirk.</P><P>Naruto turned around.</P><P>He was smiling evilly, with his eyes glowing red.</P><P>Sasuke was starting to get scared. He shook it off and
took a fighting stance.</P><P>(Note that this part goes great with 'Get Down With the
Sickness' or 'Awaken', both songs by Disturbed)</P><P>Naruto started chuckling evilly.</P><P>It was unnerving Sasuke. It was more disturbing than
Orochimaru's laugh ten fold.</P><P>It then turned into an insane laugh.</P><P>He stopped and looked at Sasuke.</P><P>His eyes were completely red and were glowing.</P><P>His mouth and had turned into an impossible smile with
ruined teeth.</P><P>His hood was tattered and casted a shadow on his face.</P><P>His skin was starting to turn grey and stitches were
appearing on him.</P><P>His tank top dissapeared and all that was left were his
boots, pants, jacket and hood.</P><P>On his wrists were prison cuffs with chains, on his neck
was a similar cuff with chains.</P><P><B>"Whats wrong Sasuke? Scared? I thought the
mighty Uchiha wouldn't be scared by little ol' me?" </B>Naruto
said in raspy, evil voice.</P><P>It sounded like there were two voices, Naruto's and the
creatures.</P><P>To say Sasuke was scared was an understatement. He
was scared shitless.</P><P>But his fear only fueled his anger and confusion, making
him activate his Sharingan.</P><P>"I'm stronger than you now, dobe. Your going down,
and I'll prove that I'm stronger." Sasuke said, anger lacing
each word.</P><P>Naruto was even happier. If possible his smile was
bigger, unnerving Sasuke more.</P><P><B>"Well then, lets see who the dobe is now, shall
we?" </B>Naruto asked.</P><P>Sasuke charged him while drawing his katana, imbuing it
with lighting chakra.</P><P>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________</P><P>Naruto: Hell yeah! Time to whup sum' ass!</P><P>Chief: Well then, I thought about giving you my Katana
from my other story Perfect Insanity.</P><P>Naruto: Which one?</P><P>Chief: The one from my other story, you know, Kanzen
Fuuten?</P><P>Naruto: Oh yeah, what does Kanzen Fuuten mean anyway?</P><P>Chief: Perfect Insanity.</P><P>Naruto: Oh, nice name then.</P><P>Chief: So should you have the enchanted katana or not?</P><P>Naruto: I dunno, make a poll, see what the people want.</P><P>Chief: Alright then, a poll will be made to see if you
should get a weapon. I'll decide the weapon though.</P><P>Naruto: YAY!!! I want a gun!</P><P>Chief: No. No gun for you!</P><P>(Chibi Master Chief beating chibi Naruto with a stick)</P><P>Naruto: Why not?</P><P>Chief: Because I FUCKING SAID SO!</P><P>Naruto Fine. <I>Jackass.</I></P><P>Chief: What was that?</P><P>Naruto: Nothing.</P><P>Chief: The Real Master Chief signing off! *Gives Salute*</P>

chakra.</P><P>He brought down his sword, ready to cut Naruto in half
when-</P><P><B>CLANK!</B></P><P>Sasuke was wide eyed. Naruto had brought a weapon out of
nowhere.</P><P>It was large katana.</P><P>The blade was black and had 'Perfect Insanity' on either
side of the blade in white. (Carved in Japanese)</P><P>The handle and guard were black as well, the guard had
red lining it, while the handle red streaking down the middle.</P><P>He was holding the sword in his left hand and the sheath
with the right.</P><P>(Cue 'Perfect Insanity' by Disturbed)</P><P>Naruto pushed Sasuke back with incredible force.</P><P>Sasuke flipped in the air and landed on his feet.</P><P>Naruto dropped the sheath and charged Sasuke.</P><P>He swung at Sasuke's left, then vertically at his head.</P><P>He then began attacking Sasuke with lightning fast
attacks.</P><P>It was vertical, horizontal, vertical, vertical,
horizontal, vertical and so on.</P><P>Sasuke barely blocked each attack.</P><P>Then Sasuke tried to sweep kick Naruto, only for him to
jump back land on his feet.</P><P>Sasuke rushed at him and charged his sword with more
lightning chakra.</P><P>In response Naruto charged his sword with fire.</P><P>The swords clashed, creating a shockwave as the swords
made contact.</P><P>There was a storm of lightning and fire, each element
trying to overpower the other.</P><P>Eventually, Sasuke couldn't handle it anymore and was
blown back.</P><P>As Sasuke got to his feet he saw Naruto in a position
that would horrify anyone who saw.</P><P>Naruto stood there in his alternate form, surrounded by
fire and lightning, while standing in the horizon.</P><P>It was a sight that would scare even the bravest of men.</P><P>He looked like the Devil himself, ready to collect
Sasuke's soul.</P><P>He then charged Naruto again.</P><P>What they didn't know was that everyone in the village
was watching this.</P><P>The tourists cheered, the gray skinned man from the
Disturbed album covers was fighting someone. And winning.</P><P>The villagers cheered for Sasuke to destroy the
creature.</P><P>The shinobi didn't get near them, for they knew they
would be caught in the crossfire.</P><P>Sasuke was panting heavily, he looked at Naruto with his
active Sharingan.</P><P>"Why? WHY THE HELL CAN'T I BEAT YOU?!!!" he
yelled.</P><P>Somehow, the image of the altered Naruto was starting to
look like Itachi.</P><P>Sasuke decided he was going to end it now.</P><P>He was about to activate his curse mark when out of
nowhere Gaara appeared in front of Naruto.</P><P>"Naruto, what the hell do you think your doing?"
Gaara asked/demanded.</P><P><B>"Showing little Sasuke here who the real dobe
was. I think my work here is done."</B> said
Naruto as he dissapeared and reappeared in the same spot but normal.</P><P>"I think he got the message, now lets go."
Gaara said.</P><P>"WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU GOING! GET BACK HERE AND
FIGHT YOU COWARD!" Sasuke yelled.</P><P>Naruto ignored him as he kept walking.</P><P>*Konoha Hospital, Akemi's room, 6:32am*</P><P>Akemi and Naruto were in her room.</P><P>He was beside in a chair while she had Ryuu in her arms.</P><P>She was currently playing with the baby when the door
opened to see Sakura and Shizune walk in.</P><P>Sakura saw Naruto with Akemi, but her gaze was fixed on
Ryuu.</P><P>He looked identical to Naruto in every way.</P><P>She had mixed emotions about it that couldn't be
described.</P><P>"Awwww, he's so cute!" Shizune said looking at
Ryuu.</P><P>"Thank you, he gets that from Naruto." Akemi
said looking to Naruto who blushed slightly.</P><P>"Well, anyway, what is it?" Akemi asked.</P><P>"We just came to check up on you." Shizune
answered.</P><P>"Well we have to go to check other patients, see
you soon."</P><P>"Ya, see ya later." Naruto said.</P><P>Shizune was leaving but Sakura was standing in the
doorway looking at them.</P><P>"Sakura, are you coming?" Shizune asked.</P><P>"Yeah." she said.</P><P>They exited the room but Sakura was still thinking hard.</P><P>*Performance Hall 2, The Crowd, 9:23pm*</P><P>All of Naruto's old friends were in the crowd of were
Naruto was going to perform.</P><P>They were looking around when the band came from
underneath the stage with fog around them.</P><P>They were all looking at the ground not moving.</P><P>The crowd only cheered louder.</P><P>(Cue, 'Get Down With the Sickness', by Disturbed)</P><P>The beating of drums echoed through everyone's ears.</P><P><I><B>"Can you feel that?"</B></I></P><P><I><B>"Ah shit."</B></I></P><P><B>"OOH AH AH AH AH!"</B></P><P><B>"OOH AH AH AH AH!"</B></P><P><B>"Drowning deep, In my sea of loathing, Broken
