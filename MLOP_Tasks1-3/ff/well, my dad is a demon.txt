Also he looked like he lived in the forrest as his hair was longer at his left and bound in 3 ponytails with feathers decorating the 3 golden blond locks.</p><p>She didn't understand, she was trieing to talk to him but he only responded in barks and growls like he could understand her but spoke in an animals language, no matter she tried again.</p><p>"h-hello…"</p><p>"…."</p><p>"i-I'm h-Hinata a-and y-you??"</p><p>"…." Still nothing, hinata sigs she could get a name or anything from the boy.<br>"naruto…. My name is naruto, y-you smell like human, I shouldn't be here my dad wil be angry if he knows I spoke with a human like yourself" hinata looks up at the deep growling voice <i>'human?? But he's human himself, why should his father get angry when he only talkes to his own kind?'</i>hinata looks confused at naruto "b-but naruto-san, you're human yourself why would your father be angry it's nice to get to know new people"</p><p>naruto shakes his head violently "n-no!! m-my dad said humans don't like yokai and halfdemons!! My dad can know, he was tricked by an red eyed man to atack the nearest villaged here!"</p><p>"b-but only kyuubi a-atacked 10 years ago a-and h-he was killed by the yondaime!"</p><p>naruto lookes stunned and then falls to the ground laughing his ass off "hahahahah yeah sure my dad, the demon king kyuubi killed by a mere mortal??? Sorry but that's soo unbelievible that it's funny!!" while naruto keeps on laughing, hinata become's red from shame and anger</p><p>"WEL SORRY MISTER BUT THAT'S WAS IS TOLD AT SCHOOL HISTORY CLASS!!!" a deep growling chuckle rises from the trees<br><b>"wel miss Hyuuga then your teatchers have lied a mortal can never kill me they can to some degrea control me for a short time but killing me is inpossible, after all I wouldn't be inmortal if I could get killed now would i?"</b> naruto shuts up and lookes as his dad slippes from the branch he was sitting on, the demon lord doesn't look angry but naruto has a nasty feeling it could come later.</p><p>"h-hi dad…. How's it rolling?" kyuubi's chuckle fades slowly and his wisker-marked face now stands serious <b>" wel I felt a human in my forrest and your chakra in the same spot, what in inari-sama's name did I tell you wenever you would meet a human beeing?!"</b> the last part shouted at his blond son.<br>"n-never come in contact with them and run away or k-kill them if you do ?" naruto answers a bit scared. He didn't want to kill his new friend and it was to late for running now, she already knew to much. <b>"very good son but why didn't you do either of them?"</b> red slitted eyes bore into naruto's blue ones.</p><p>"c-couse she was beeing nice to me a-and wel…."<br><b>"you wanna be friends?"</b> kyuubi looks amused at his so called son, not that he could blame the boy. The boy was part human afterall he could recall the first time he saw him like it was yesterday.</p><p>(flashback no jutsu)</p><p>kyuubi was bored… no scratch that he was livid and bored!!!! First he get's tricked by an damn man whit red eyes, beeing send to a village to demollige it and then their leader some blond pup!

It's like someone's fighting" and indeed the sound of fighting and cursing sounds on the other side of the closed door.</p><p>CRACK!!! A sandcollored blur trashes trough one of the ricepaper doors followed by a loud curse from said blur <b>"HOW DARE YOU TO CROSS A DEMON PRIEST YOU SON OF A *#$$!!!!!!/"</b> not even noticing that a 5 year old was listining too.</p><p><b>"sir get the hell out of here! You're corupting my son" </b>kyuubi growls at the man who stays cursing until he takes in the man's apearance, sandy blond hair in one short ponytail, weird purple tatoo's on his face and arms, pointed ears, golden eyes with slits in it,and then his clothes a little pries, freeloader kinda funny combo with a black muscle shirt without sleaves and a baggy white priestpants hold up with a black leather robe. Kyuubi only knew one demon who dressed that way. His youngest brother…</p><p><b>"SHUKAKU!!!!

A-are you sure ?" kotetsu looks at the blond boy . only one person in the whole village looked that way and he waas dead, sunkissed blond hair,saphire blue eyes and a cheecky fox grin. This boy looked so much like the yondaime hokage that it was scarry only the slight fangs,claws, slited pupils and the whiskers made him a wilder version of the late blond hokage 'this must be reported to sandaime and fast' kotetsu walks to the kids</p><p>'hinata-chan, narruto-san I'm sorry but you 2 must go to sandaime-sama now okay?

He handed the 3 iwa-nin over to ibiki who reported that the iwa-nin had badly injured uzumaki kushina, then tried to unseal the kyuubi and tried to kill baby naruto but failed when the demon lord escaped his card, send 10 of their nins flying in rage and beat them knock out. Sarutobi never heared of the fox demon or the baby again only a little letter was left <i>'I'll father the child'</i> singed with a bloody paw print.</p><p>The aged hokage still wondered why the demon never finished his job on destroying konoha gakure no sato, and he probably never would. (yeah right he's gonna know it duh) outsource the village never knew kyuubi was free only chuunin and up knew the truth about both kyuubi and naruto the gennin and civilians only heard that the yondaime's wife and offspring were gone.</p><p>Knock knock'</p><p>"yes come in" sarutobi could see the high stack of paperwork that would come in before his eyes,</p><p>"hokage-sama we have a child here without a pass that wands access to the village little hyuuga hinata says he's her new friend"</p><p>that wasn't what sarutobi thought he would hear when the door opened.</p><p>"oh hello kotetsu-kun well bring them in already" sandaime says while putting on a grandfatherly smile, kind, old and still serious.</p><p>Litlle hyuuga hinata walks in a bit but a tanned claw like hand holds her back a bit, the claws unnerve the old kage a bit but he keeps calm. What would the village be if their kage panicked by seeing a clawed hand, I mean the inuzuka clan kids had claws often too.</p><p>"c-come on Na-naruto-kun l-lord hokage isn't s-scary a-at all"</p><p>sarutobi almost drops his pipe as the blond boy walks in, the blond 10 year old looked almost like minato, only a few wild streaks showed the aged kage that minato wasn't reborn into the boy,the boy stood tall for his age being almost a head taller then the litlle heiress. A mop of spiky sun colored blond hair framed his face while 3 long ponytails were draped over his left shoulder decorated with different bird feathers. The boy looked stunning much like namikaze minato but had a more animalistic look, his sapphire eyes were cat like with those black feline like pupils and those whisker like marks on his cheeks, his canines were en longed and seemed very sharp, his orange kimono was surprisingly clean and a 3 tailed forest green fox printed on his right hip till his left ankle. Sarutobi put on his most grandfatherly face and looked at the 2 children with a soft smile.</p><p>"hello children, welcome. Oh hinata how is little hanabi doing? Is her fever getting down?"</p><p>little hinata nods while the blond looks wary at the aged village leader</p><p>"and I assume that you're naruto?" the blond nods but looks suspicious at the man.</p><p>"and naruto can I ask you a question?" again the blond, naruto, nods</p><p>"okey then who is your father naruto?"</p><p>"………." No answer</p><p>'please naruto could you answer the question please?"</p><p>"……." Again naruto doesn't answer the old kage</p><p>" please?"</p><p>"grrrr arf !"</p><p>a growl and a deep bark, sarutobi had never met a human child that barked like a real animal!!!</p><p>Hinata giggles " n-naruto-kun w-we d-don't understand a-animal s-sounds you know t-that"</p><p>The wild boy looks at the shy girl surprising her with his deep voice once again and shocking both the chuunin and old leader</p><p>"w-why do you stutter so much? In the forest you stopped for a bit and you sound pretty without the stutter" now the kage droped his pipe ' he sounded just like minato when he was in his late teens and this child is 10!!! His voice is much deeper then actually possible for such a small child, naruto what happened to you the last 9 years?'</p><p>the blond turn to the old kage</p><p>"sir, you asked for my father but I have to ask, did you mean namikaze minato or the kyuubi no yokou??"</p><p>sarutobi gasps, so his worst fear was true! The son of his late successor and sadly predecessor was raised by the demon lord!</p><p>"so y-you know?"</p><p>the boy smiles "yes I know about minato-tousan and kushina-kaachan, tou-sama told me a lot about them." Sarutobi looks warry at the blond, oke he is the son of the yondaime and the late princess of whirlpool but he's also raised by a demon!!!!</p><p>"n-naruto-kun? Who a-are minato a-and kushina?they sound familiar" little hinata says shy.</p><p>"he's the fourth hokage hinata-chan and kushina was his wife and konoha's akairo no uzu (the hidden leaf's red vortex)"</p><p>naruto smiles at hinata "yep and their my mom and dad"</p><p>hinata looks confused at naruto</p><p>"but what about kyuubi? You look around the age he attacked maybe a few days older, isn't he your father?" naruto chuckles "no he's my adoptive father but I've bin with him for 9 years and all the youkai made me half demon so he's half my real dad also" sarutobi perks up</p><p>"I just had a thought, do you by any chance know why your father attacked the village?"</p><p>"well I think he can explain it better sandaime-sama"naruto says and points to the window.</p><p>On the window stands a tall man with long furry red hair, fangs, clawed hands, whiskers,red slitted eyes and a long red cape over black shinobi gear.</p><p><b>"why hello old monkey long time no see"</b></p><p>"kurou takehiko! What what are you doing here?

I'll explain why I attacked my own friend!"</b> sarutobi looks wary at the redhead but sits down altough ready to defend himself</p><p><b>"oke so it happened when minato asked me to deliver this special scroll to kumo, and run into someone I hadn't seen since the shodai's time. I thought the fool had died in his fight with your sensei but madara uchiha was still very much alive and pissed at me for some stupid reason… the bastard, I still reared giving him the route to akare <i>(oc god of blood)</i>. Damn the whole sharingan wouldn't exist!!!"</b></p><p>"dad you're ranting again don't drift of topic again" naruto says cousing kyuubi, er tekehiro to blink.</p><p><b>"oh right er… well so he was kinda pissed and threw some genjutsu over me with his magenkyou sharingan, the bastard! And send me here to attack!! I didn't even have the choice to stop I was like some doll he used,it was frustrating, and then when I saw minato on bunta's head with a big card, seriously the pup watches to much TV! I mean he got the idea from that anime, yu gi oh!!!"</b> naruto kughs to get his father back on track.</p><p><b>"oh right well I saw minato's face and I just knew he would seal me, he started to apologize and said he would seal 10% of my chakra in his son so he could control the card when he was older. I yelled at him that I was sorry but I couldn't speak the human toungh then. madara cut it of my ability to do so, minato could still understand a bit of what I said so he understood who really did this to our village but he never had the change to say it to another. He had baby naruto with him tough, in case the card failed, he would use naruto to seal me. He then asked me to seal aportion of his soul in naruto-kun when I was about to get sealed by the shinigami and inari, inari was very trubbled that I was controlled like this and he blessed me so the mayenkou wouldn't affect me anymore, a year later kushina died, I was freed and took naruto on kushi-chan's request I didn't have my memories then but I gained them a few hours after I returned to my den, I've grieved for hours about what I'd done and vowed to rais naruto like my own son"</b> takehiko finishes.

Oh I also met some of the other buijiu and some jinchuriki and stuff, like aunt mai-necco and uncle hachji and their jinchuriki yugito and killerbee"</p><p>Sarutobi looks up from this "you mean nii yugito from kumo and killerbee as in the little brother of the raikage?" naruto nods happy</p><p>"yes oh and shukaku and his new apprentice sabaku no gaara the kazekage's youngest son."</p><p>Sarutobi looks trubbled for a while "when do they come here?"</p><p>Kyuubi smiles <b>" at the chuunin exam after naruto graduates saru, I'll be collecting my bro's and sister in the meantime, since the half of it is in iwa and other hostile countries of konoha"</b></p><p>Sarutobi looks up "you want to make a kind of alliance trough the bijuu?"</p><p><b>"no I'm gonna get my family together again. And hope to do so in the next 3 years while naruto stays here"</b></p><p>sarutobi looks at kyuubi "that's possible but why has naruto to stay here?"</p><p>kyuubi scowls <b>"because kiri and iwa didn't like minato verry much and naruto simply looks to much like him, I even heard they behead any child who strikes at least the simerelies of the blond hair and blue eyes saru that's why"</b> sarutobi signs "oke but where does he have to live?" kyuubi thinks for a moment <b>"well minato did see kakashi as a sort of son and kakashi was very obnoxious to get a little brother. I guess naruto could stay with the silver haired runt"</b> sarutobi smiles "you're right oh naruto, would you like to enter the academy to become a shinobi?" naruto nods "yes sir," sarutobi smiles " oke then go to this place tomorrow at 7 oke naruto-kun?" and sautobi gives the blond a map with 2 circles one saying academy and the other hatake kakashi's house .naruto bows to the old man.</p><p>"oke sarutobi-san… ehhmm dad can I go shopping for shinobi clothes with hinata-chan now?" both demon and kage nodd</p><p>"Thanx come on hinata!!"</p><p>And naruto runs out of the office dragging one litlle hyuuga hinata after him.</p><p>Sautobi chuckles "he acts so much like his mother" kyuubi nodds</p><p><b>"That he does you old monkey that he does"</b></p><p>Sarutobi looks at the redhaired man "you didn't change much takehiko, not at all"</p><p>Kyuubi smiles his fangs shining in the sunlight <b>"ofcource I'm not changing anytime soon either old man well… is arashi still here or not?"</b></p><p>"You mean your nephew?

Why didn't you say takehiko was the kyuubi?!!!" arashi blushes a bright red and chuckles nervous "you didn't know?"</p><p>sarutobi blinks and then shakes his head in negative "well I tought you knew sorry saru-sama" sarutobi looks up and blinks again " what does that kitsune family of yours have with calling me a monkey?" kyuubi chuckles <b>"becouse your name means monkey jump you old fool"</b></p><p>saurobi thinks</p><p><i>(inside sarutobi's mindscape )</i></p><p><i>sarutobi sees a chibi version of himself writing his name on a chalkboard, then he sees the chibi pull his name apart seperating it in saru and tobi, under the kata's he sees the translation under saru: monkey and under tobi: jump.</i></p><p>Back in the real world Sarutobi sweatdrops his name had to be something like that didn't it?</p><p>"Wel oke now we had that arashi takehiko want's to ask you something"</p><p>Arashi nods and turns to his uncle.</p><p><b>"Ehh… arashi you know your uncles and aunts right?"</b> arashi nodds thinking of the other bijuu<b> "well I'm gonna seek them our and bring the family together again so the akatsuki won't threaten us more then when we are all alone, I've heard they look for the bijuu and I don't like it"</b> arashi nods again <b>"so could you watch naruto for a bit?

Naruto looks at the board for a second befor walking inside.</p><p>"Hello? Anybody here?" naruto shouts out seeing no one in the shop.</p><p>"naruto-kun look at this" hinata says holding out a red muscle shirt, black anbu like cargopants and a orange/black jacked, naruto's face lits up "it's awesome I only need a forest green 3 tailed fox on the right side of the jacked and I'm ready for anything!!" naruto shouts.</p><p>An old man finaly come's from the back of the store looking at what is making so much noise</p><p>"oh hello kids what can I do for you?" naruto smiles</p><p>"hey mister could you put a forest green 3 tailed fox in 3 of these jackets? And could I get 3 more pair of these red shirts and these black pants?" the old man looks at the boy "ofcource anything else?" naruto nodds " 2 pair of black shinobi sandals please" the man nods will be done in a few minutes wait here" and the man disapears to the back again.</p><p>(with arashi)</p><p>'where the hell is he? I can't find him!!! Oh there he is stupid litlle…' arashi jumps from the roof landing before naruto and hinata, the later schrieking in fright however naruto only looks bored at the blue kitsune masked male</p><p>"hey arashi-san" arashi blinks "you know me?" naruto nodds</p><p>"yeah dad said that when I saw a male around 19 with a fox tatoo and a blue kitsune mask on I should adress him as arashi-san" arashi blinks that wasso his uncle damn him</p><p>"oke well the hokage asked me to keep an eye on you and takehiko-ojisan said you are a prankster so I need to pay close attention, let's go to kakashi-san's house"</p><p>(At the hatake apartment)</p><p>hatake kakashi the copy nin is a pervert he doesn't even denay it I mean he reads jiraya's icha icha series in the open !! but now the silver haired ANBU captain was reading a piece of paper from 9 years ago.</p><p>Kakashi was griefing... Why? Wel let's just say he failed, in what? In life he failed his teammate's obito, who was crushed in his first mision as a jounin, rin died in the kyuubiatack right before his eyes burning alive and his sesei died that same day asking him to look out for his wife and son. Wich he failed in also, he was on some stupid mission when kushina-chan was atacked by some iwa-nin's, kyuubi escaped and naruto-ototou disapeard, he failed them all and couldn't live with it, he storted his whole life in missions becoming a feared man kakashi the copy nin they feared him for a good reason too, obito's eye helped him a great deal as he was known for copieing over a 1000 jutsu whit that eye of him.</p><p>Kakashi signs "minato-sesei I failed you I couldn't even protect my own ototou" the man whispers tears flowing from both … KNOCK KNOCK… some one knocks on his door</p><p>"OKE WHO DARES TO INTERUPT MY GRIEF…." Kakshi falls silent with the sight before him, in frond of him stands a 10 year old boy, a boy with spiky wild yellowish blond hair and saphire blue eyes 6 whiskermarks on his cheeks and a toothy big smile on his face. That smile, kakashi never tought he would see that smile again. The last time was 10 years ago when his sensei smiled at him before dieing in the then 14 year old's arms. And yet now he sees a wilder version of his sensei in the form of a 10 year old boy 'naruto would've been 10 yesterday' tears yet again welling up in the lone ANBU's eye.</p><p>Then the boy speaks with a deep growling voice surprising the inu captain "are you hatake kakshi?" kakashi nodds "I am who want's to know?"</p><p>The boy smirks "why would your own otouto not want to know who his aniki is?"</p><p>Kakashi gasps "a-aniki??Otouto? W-who are y-you?"</p><p>The blond pouts "awee 9 years and you don't reconice the son of your own sensei? What a shame kakashi-aniki, and I tought you couldn't wait for my arival" kakashi's face becomes red with rage as he sees the sly smile on the brat's face " I don't know why you think this is funny but naruto was kidnaped 9 years ago and is most likely dead!!! I've searsed for him all these years and couldn't find him once!" tears flow freely out of kakashi's eyes not even caring that another anbu captain is watching, 'wait a minute another captain???' kakashi looks at the blue fox mask "oh kurou-senpai I'm so sorry I didn't see you why is this brat looking like a mini minato-sensei?"</p><p>Arashi chuckles "he already told you seems like my uncle takehiko took hi with him to a safe place and brought him here so naruto can live with you for the next 3 years in the least"</p><p>Kakashi looks agape at the blue masked man "s-so this is realy my otouto?"</p><p>Arashi nodds "yep so go talk to eachother and stuff I have a mission… oh kakshi ou have 2 weeks of to get to know the litlle fox here" and arashi disapears in a swirl of leaves.</p><p>"ehm well… come in I gues" kakshi says wary and leads the two 10 year old inside his house.</p>

Academy starts in 15 minutes time to wake up Aniki"</p><p>And he walked to his older brothers room</p><p>there in a king sized bed lay the (in)famous hatake kakashi the copy nin, a man who had copied over a 1000 jutsu, not that naruto was soo impressed about that his tou-sama had more then 225000 jutsu in the library wich is tou-sama could do all too. However naruto saw something he didn't before, on the nightstand lay the famous half face mask and hitai ate of the silver haired 24 year old man and so his older brother was bare faced now. Not wanna loose the sight of his aniki's face naruto crept to the bed looking to the smooth pale skin of his aniki, 'well it's obvious why he hides his face he looks like some poster boy'</p><p>takehiko told naruto that hatake sakumo, his aniki's father hid his face also,and his father being one of the arashi yo, he knew a lot about kakashi's father, minato-tou had even rescued kakashi when he was 4, the poor silver haired toddler was chased into the forest of death by a horde fangirls from his father and he stayed 2 ½ days their trying to survive from being eaten, well let's say after minato saved him he wore that facemask of his, and still he wears it because he still has the creeps for fangirls and… well it's funny to see all the a temps people make to actually see his face.</p><p>But now his face was as bare as it was when kakashi was born. And that face woke up with 3 bushy golden blond tails on it.</p><p>'what the ?... oh yeah naruto's tails' let's say kakashi freaked out the first time he saw them</p><p><u>*mini flashback no jutsu*</u></p><p>the first morning that naruto stayed at kakashi's home.

Only after naruto explained that his father sealed 10% of kyuubi's chakra in him and that beeing around kitsune that much his yokai grew and made him a hanyou.</p><p><u>*mini flashback, kai!*</u></p><p>"naruto w-what are you doing (yawn) it's just… ehhh now what time is it again?" naruto chuckles he couldn't believe that his aniki is the best ANBU captain at the moment but can't even wake up in the morning. "it's 7 aniki I'll be going in 15 minutes and you have to report to sandaime-ojisama in 20 minutes so see yah!"</p><p>kakashi grumbles "oh naru-chan?

I already have a present" hinata's head shoots up in surprise "r-really?" naruto nods handing her a big box that he had on his back</p><p>"it's a special present I hope you like it"</p><p>when hinata opens the box a violet fox kit jumps out nuzzling in her shoulder</p><p>"i-it's so c-cute naruto-k-kun"</p><p>naruto scratches the back of his neck with a goofy smile " this is murasaki-chan (violet or purple) she's kaen's (flame's) little sister, you know my fox partner?" hinata nods knowing the golden red firefox that always lay in the blonds crème collord bag, "well murasaki is a water-fox, I thought she would fit in since you feel like a water type" naruto says blushing</p><p>hinata smiles sweetly " y-you are r-right i-I am a w-water type that's w-why my juuken (gentle fist) is s-so bad because it's an earth styled combat style"</p><p>"well we'll just have to make it more smooth with special moves for water types so you can do it better"</p><p>hinata nods "oh naruto-kun i-I have s-someone to pick me u-up after s-school, can she come too?"naruto thinks for a second "yeah sure I mean some friend of aniki pickes me up too so I guess she could come too right?"</p><p>-3 minutes before end of school -</p><p>"IRUKA-KUN WHERE IS THE PERVERT'S GAKI?" naruto looks up as a tan collord blur races into the classroom. Iruka-sensei chuckles nervously</p><p>"to early again mitarashi-san?" iruka says from behind a big banner that's stretched before the chalkboard</p><p>'THE SUPER, SEXY AND SINGLE CHUNIN MITARASHI ANKO HAS ARRIVED!'</p><p>the blur, now revealed to be a woman looks around the classroom, her pupil less, moka-brown eyes scan the whole room before resting on naruto, a sadistic smirk crosses her beautiful face, walking up to the blond while swinging her hips, her stretch coat swaying behind her. as she leans over naruto's desk he sees that she only wears a fishnet shirt,and a tan collerd miniskirt, so showing her rater sized bust. "hey mini blondaime" naruto purrs as her fingers brush over his whisker marks 'damn why are my whiskers so sensitive?' the women's smirk widens</p><p>"ah foxy-kun really likes to be petted like the demonfox he is?" anko whispers in his ear cousing him to stiffen in his seat. "anyway I heard you were go…" the bell cut's mitarashi off and then the door opens, stepping inside comes a tall raven haired chuunin, her body wrapped in white bandaged and her left arm covert in a long kimono like red sleeve,her headband holding her curly hair out of her wine red eyes.</p><p>"anko? What are you doing here?" Anko looks at the chuunin "heey kurunai-chan how are you picking up the hyuuga girl?"</p><p>kurunai nods " and you?" anko poses in a sexy maner "I'm here to pick up pervy scarecrow's gaki blondaime!" hinata and naruto facefall. "pervy sca… you mean kakashi has a brat? Since when does he have a son?" anko smirks at her shocked friend "nai-chan nai-chan, it's his litlle brother that I'm talking about" kurunai looks the kids over "where?" anko smirks "this little yondaime blondaime look alike" the whole class looks at naruto, and indead he resembels a great deal with the young deseased kage.</p><p>"oh…. Well hinata what do you want to do today? I mean we have all day together" hinata nods shyly before hiding inside naruto's jacked, embarresed. Both chuunin smile</p><p>"a-ano kurunai-san… ano me and n-naruto-kun wanted to go celebrate m-my birthday s-since he isn't allowed to come to m-mine tomorrow"</p><p>kurunai smiles soft "well we could celebrate it with the 4 of us if anko agrees ofcourse" anko's sadistic smile widens "ofcource I agree but blondaime gaki has to pay!" naruto huffs "why do I have to pay?" anko leans toward his ear as does kurunai "because little yokou you have your fathers wealth and I'm sure that your kyuubi-otousama would find you a gentleman if you would pay for 3 ladies" kurunai looks shocked at the blond then at anko and lastly at hinata " you 2 know this?" hinata nods "k-kyuubi-sama is very nice actually naruto said that his biological parents knew him very well" naruto nods "yeah and the atack wasn't his fault but sandaime-jiji knows so don't sweat it let's make a party for hina-chan"</p><p>-10 minutes later at the dango shop-</p><p>"happy birthday hinata/brat/hina-chan/hyuuga-sama happy birthday to you" the 3 sing loudly while the rest of the shop's customers sing with them in a bit quieter voice. Hinata blushes very much and hides in naruto's jacked.</p><p>"awwe hinata-chan don't worry oh my father send a few presents by the way they're from my aunt, uncles and killer bee, yugito and gaara!" hinata's eyes bulge "b-but they don't even know me" naruto chuckles "my friends are their friend well that's what hachi-ojisan always says and niiobasan always says to shear friendship so I send dad a letter and he was with gaara and ichiojisan in cloud so yeah…." Naruto blushes and gives 3 different colored boxes, a blue one with purple cats one white with black oxes and a sand colored one with red tanuki on it.</p><p>Hinata opens the first one, a beautiful outfit, a bit too big for now comes out of it, a purple top that exposed the belly and an even purple collored skirt, a long white piece of silk was sewn in the kirt so it would cover part of the legs a black belt was also included as was 1 long sleeved fingerless glove, knee high ninja boots and a long purple whip with a black hold.

My dad is away with hanabi and I don't really trust the e-elders" naruto nods "sure…I think I'll need your shoulder tough I feel kinda dizzy" and then naruto's legs collapses on themselves letting the boy fall to the ground "naruto-kun!" hinata's violet colored fox, murasaki jumps out of her bag followed by kaen from naruto's becoming as big as a small pony " naruto-sama you know that gaining a tail is tiering why did you go outside?" murasaki asks her voice sounding like a beautiful harp, "you know me saki-chan I hate resting" murasaki looks at her brother's partner and her prince</p><p>"well… you climb on kaen and hinata will be carried by me oke naruto-kun?"</p><p>naruto nods and both ride out of the academy shocking and scaring several villagers to see pony sized FOXES in konoha… as the 4 ride to behind the hokage mountain and into a quit good disguised cave entrance they didn't sense the raven haired boy following them</p><p>*in the cave*</p><p>"kaen I can walk now" kaen lowers down and let's his buddy get of of him, murasaki walks a bit further and comes by a wall of leaves? Brushing the long leaf like curtain aside hinata sees a breathtaking sight. There was so much water! Naruto's clan home was more like a cave with the ceiling missing where a huge lake lay, islands of varying sized littering the lake where giant three houses grew, not like a three house that children made but the houses where literly growing from the three itself! And the bridges connecting the islands where beautyfull and grew out of the threes and ground too. It just looked like a place from a fairytale.</p><p>Naruto seeing the awed look smiles gently at his best friend " like it?"</p><p>The girl only nods making naruto's smile wider making a funny presentating stands he says: "then my lady welcome in the fox realm"</p><p>Hinata giggles " it's wonderful naruto-kun where is your home?" naruto smirks leading the girl over 5 bridges and a path of Grey steps coming by a small waterfall. Next to the waterfall, in the rock stands a dark blue gate, not too big or anything but not too small tough… jiraya could fit inside that gate 6 times but that's just a mini detail.</p><p>hinata looks at the threes this part being different then where she entered as these threes where red, yellow and pink, she even saw a bush with blue leaves. Naruto smiles as a little group of 2 tailed fox cubs runs up to him snuggling his legs</p><p>"naruto-niichan!"</p><p>"naruto-nii, are you gonna play with us now?"<br>" hey kyo I wanted to ask that"</p><p>"no i wanted too ask"</p><p>"too bad chou, akaru I was first"</p><p>"naruto-nii!

Sasuke looks wide eyed at the so called dope of his class,</p><p>"your father can do that but only demon lords can…your father is a demon lord?" naruto smirks " let me introduce myself: kurou naruto, gobi no yokou and son of kurou takehiko the kyuubi no yokou, the lord of bijyuu"</p><p>sasuke's eyes widen as the foxes in that heared naruto cheer with loud roars</p><p>"y-you're the k-kyuubi's s-son?" naruto's smirk turns a fox like evil</p><p>"who do you think is the lord of a FOX clan you baka?" sasuke glares "so what if kyuubi's your daddy I need the power to kill 'him' I just need to!"</p><p>naruto's brow goes up an inch "who do you need to kill…you're brother?"</p><p>sasuke's head turns red from anger "YES I NEED THE POWER TO KILL ITACHI HE KILLED MY CLAN!

Your enemy does everything to stun your growth to grow stronger you have to do exactly the opposite of what he says!"</p><p>sasuke's eyes widen 'why would his bro..no that man help him and advice him to hate him to get stronger?'</p><p>"you have a point dope but what should I do then?" the blond smiles "get friends, precious people to protect that's how you get truly strong"</p><p>the uchiha falls onto the ground his mind in overdrive at what the blond said to him just now 'could I really have friends?

Iruka was at the end of his patience…it was his job to educate the next generation of konoha's ninja but some didn't even show up on time. The chuunin,replacing mizuki came in with the team assignments as soon as the chuunin left iruka heard laughter from around the corner 'is that sasuke?,I never heard him laugh before' "I swear sasuke he is still alive"the room hears a snort "yeah right not even uchiha live that long , how old where you anyway?" the deep voice of kurou naruto answers "4 but I'm serious dad was super pissed he caused dad's aTtack after all" the door opens revealing a smiling uchiha sasuke</p><p>sakura looks jealous at the blond 'how dare he to make my sasuke-kun smile? Although it is cute he smiles nice' 'SHANAROOO SASUKE EVEN LOOKS BETTER NOW!'</p><p>iruka looks at the 2 clan heirs "mind to tell me why you where late?" naruto looks at the brown haired dolphin "yes, you see there were these 3 foxes from my compound that wanderd to sasuke's house so he had to bring them to me and my house is a mile from the village so it lasted some time and before we could go I had to attend a meeting and sasuke stayed so we could walk to school together." Iruka signs not knowing if naruto was telling the truth or if he go the excuses learned from his older brother.</p><p>"oke let's get to the teams team 1….</p><p>Team 6 is kuroshi raiko, utsusemi sakemi and mako tskune your jounin teacher will be mitarashi anko" naruto shivers 'poor poor souls'</p><p>"team 7 under hatake kakashi will be uchiha sasuke, kurou naruto and hyuuga hintata"</p><p>several girls glare at the kurou and hyuuga heir and heiress</p><p>hinata shivers while naruto just dozes off knowing that their sensei will come in 3 hours</p><p>*2 ½ hours later*</p><p>so naruto what did you tell about your father and that uchiha?" naruto looks at sasuke "sure look it was like this</p><p>*flashback no jutsu*</p><p><i>4 year old naruto lay in the sunshine with another 1 tailed foxkit, his father and shirou the 1 tailed tribe leader where playing shogi when a knock was heared on the frond door</i><br><i>"I'll get it daddy!" and he runs toward the door. The door opens revealing a man with sp ikey black hair and cold black eyes. Naruto smirks at the man, the raven man just looks down at the little blond boy " boy, is kyuubi there I would like to get back something" naruto scowls he wasn't a little kid anymore even at the age of 4 he was quit mature beeing the son of the kitsune tribe leader. However, before he can even say anything he sees a tan clawed hand infrond of his face. He looks up seeing his father, his long red hair spikier then usual letting naruto know that he was on edge… and quit pissed too, if his scowling face said anything about it. Naruto smiles evilish, he just loved it when his dad was pissed it showed how awesome his dad was, the demon was just ubber bad ass! XD</i></p><p><i>the black haired man looks at the redhead "so kyuubi did you miss me?"</i></p><p><i>kyuubi looks at the man with discust <b>"uchiha madara…what are you doing here?"</b></i></p><p><i>madara's eyes bleed into red en ternal magenkyou sharingan "I came to get you back my pet you belong to me kyuubi, so bow for m….." madara couldn't even finish his claming of awesomeness as kyuubi threw him trough the door in a fit of rage…heh naruto loved his father soo much and his temper was sooo awesome when he was glowing red with rage his father's chakra swirling around his shaking body, that's how angry his father was.</i></p><p><i>After 2 ½ hours of marteling the uchiha kyuubi had enough.</i></p><p><b><i>"MADARA BE GONE AND IF YOU EVER DARE TO CALL ME YOUR PET AGAIN YOU'LL BE NOTHING MORE THEN A SMEAR OF RED UNDER MY MIGHTY PAW!"</i></b></p><p><i>*flashback no jutsu.. KAI!*</i><br>"and we never heard of him again but it was so much…fun"</p><p>both gennin look a bit cheeped out at their sadistic teammate but smile as they see the sad eyes of the 5 tailed hanyou.</p><p>"y-you must miss him very much naruto, I-I mean your father he sounds really fun to be around" hinata stutters with a small blush</p><p>"yeah he's awesome I can't wait till the chunnin exams and introduce him to sasuke"</p><p>sasuke snorts " I would like so too, that madara character sounds like a disgrace of my clan's name,where is our sensei actually?" naruto and hinata sign</p><p>"kakashi-sensei has a problem, since his friend moriko died on a mission he hasn't been the same…he's late, he's very unfocused and he started to read the whole day he even forgot that he has yuuki" and was feeling more and more down because kakashi was so depresst.</p><p>Sasuke looks at the door where footsteps are heard. Standing in the now open doorway stands a 6 feet tall man around 26 with gravity difying silver hair. His stormgrey eye roaming unfocused over the room standing shockingly still at naruto's sad face.</p><p>"n-naruto? I haven't seen you in days! Where were you? I was worried sick about you!"</p><p>naruto looks up,tears threatening to spill from his sapphire like eyes "k-kashi-nii why do you act this way?" sasuke looks shocked at his now friend, he never imagined seeing naruto of all people cry. Looking at hinata next to him he sees her crying too 'do I fit in here?' naruto dries his tears looking at kakashi in anger "you have to get over this aniki! Moriko wouldn't want you to act this way! You're late, you don't focus, you're taking suiside missions on your own and you're ignoring yuuki, Hinata and me! How can I know that we'll be safe? You can't even take care of yourself at the moment!" Kakashi freezes solid as naruto continues screaming to the silver haired jounin.</p><p>A lone tear rolls down over his masked face darkening the dark blue to almost black.</p><p>Falling to his knees he starts sobbing,letting the icha icha book fall out of his hand.</p><p>Naruto stops screaming looking shocked at the man he calls older brother</p><p>The man only cries apologizing over and over again. After what seems like years hinata walks toward the jounin followed by naruto, both hug the jounin sobbing into his vest also apologizing to the jounin.</p><p>Sasuke looks at the little family, sitting in the door opening of their old classroom</p><p>'could I be a part of this family?' kakashi looks up at the lone uchiha eye smiling although his face…or at least what's visible of his face</p><p>"hello sasuke, I'm sorry you must think that I'm really weak right now ?"</p><p>sasuke shrugs "not really" kakashi eye smiles "good them welcome on team 7, as we all know each other well maybe sasuke doesn't know me so well but we'll tell with some lunch so let's go"</p><p>*…*</p><p>the inari's den a very famous restaurant in konoha gakure, now why would it be so famous? Well… the first and second hokage came here to celebrate tsunade's 6th birthday,the sandaime came here to celebrate his team's new title as the sannin. Then jiraya came here with his gennin team after minato made chuunin… minato came here the first day with his gennin, he and kushina had their first date in this restaurant and this restaurant was the favorite eating place of the arashi yo. And all this time it has been owned by the kurou family.</p><p>"so this place is owned by your familly naruto?" said blond looks at his friend and teammate</p><p>"yep and where's getting the vip seats" sasuke nods he'd bin there once when his father had a formal family dinner with the fire lord.</p><p>"welcome naruto-sama the vip table I guess?" a green with black haired girl asks the blond. Said blond signs "hello kumiko hows kuroshi?" kumiko blushes "v-very well we plan to make it official next summer when takehiko-sama is back" naruto nods "I can't wait, could we please get the inari meat and rice plate? Extra meat and you know how to spice them"</p><p>kumiko nods "yes sir you know the way"</p><p>* lunch*</p><p>"oke team let's introduce one selves I'll start. I'm kakashi, I'm 26 and the adopted older brother of naruto I like hmm…. A lot and especially yuuki and naruto, I dislike hmmm I'm not gonna tell and my goal is to, well let's keep that to myself, you go moon-eye"</p><p>hinata nods shyly "I-I'm hyuuga hinata and I-like flower-pressing,naruto-k-kun and my s-sister, I d-dislike the way my family lives and I will change their ways! That's m-my goal"</p><p>kakashi nods "raven your turn"</p><p>sasuke nods "I'm uchiha sasuke, I don't really know but I do like the company of these 2 and also to spend time with naruto's family, I dislike my brother for what he did and I will get to know why he did it then upon that I'll decide if I'll kill him or forgive him"</p><p>kakashi's eye widens 'he changed already ? when?' "oke fox-boy go"</p><p>naruto snorts " you say it wolf-chan, anyway I'm kurou naruto, my likes include my family and friends I dislike any type of harming my precious people from anyone, if someone hurts my friends they'll have to pay, and my dream is to surpass my father"</p><p>kakashi nods "oke now that we know each other we can ea…"</p><p>an annoying voice cuts kakashi off " kurenai-sensei why is th dead-last eating in the most fancy restaurant ever?" naruto looks behind him, seeing team 8 with kiba,sakura and shino standing next to kurenai, he smiles and pats the place next to him. "he nai-chan wanna sit here?" kurenai nods happy " sure naruto-kun how's may?" kiba looks confused at the 2 "those 2 know each other?" shino shrugs "seems so" sakura just huffs " so, our sensei is a weakling if she knows him" kurenai freezes and naruto stops dead in his way to pick some meat from his plate… slowly he turns around looking pissed at the pink haired girl, his eyes glowing an golden blue."what did you say?" sakura pales "y-you heard me our sensei m-must be weak if she knows you" suddenly the restaurant seems very empty only their 2 teams and the suddenly fox-like restaurant crew are left. The waiters begin to chuckle evilly and sharp canine are shown by them, tails and fox ears appear even a few change into hybrid foxes towering over her at 7 feet tall. <i><b>"so you think we're weak? haruno my clan is the most powerful demon clan on earth, only kami-sama herself could ever stop our clan if we would start a war"</b></i></p><p>sakura shivers, her pink hair looking a few shades lighter going to a baby pink instead of a hard candy pink.</p><p>"kai!"</p><p>sakura's world starts to fade away and chatter returns to the restaurant. The fox hybrid waiters are gone and back are the formal dressed maids and waiters, however kurenai stands beside her in a genjutsu releasing handsign. Naruto has an evil smirk on his face " enjoyed my genjutsu sakura? I learned it from nai-chan and anko-chan" sakura nods fearfully and sits back down eating in silence.</p><p>Kurenai glares playfully at naruto mouthing a thank you to him. " naruto did may send new clothes again?" she nods her head to his form. Wich was covered in a skin tight, black shirt, black ninja pants and a dark blue almost black coat with a black sash over it and 2 flowing pieces at the frond. On the coat in silver stands the clan symbol of the kurou clan with the kanji 5 over it in metallic blue. His shoes are just regular black ninja sandals. Naruto nods to the red eyes beauty. She smiles at the blond going back to her terriyaki.</p><p>Smiling, the blond starts eating again.</p><p>"naruto-sama is everything to your wishes?" the newest cheff kurou kitsuko asks blushing, she was just 3 years older then naruto himself and she was his sparring partner in the 5 tailes tribe. Naruto nods thankfull "yes I would say you improved on inari's recepy I think I'll let father promote you to assisting head cheff of the kitchen when he get's back" kitsuko's eyes widen "thank you naruto-sama thank you" and she kisses himon the cheek. Naruto just chuckles " it's alright now kitsu-chan go back there are more customers you know" kitsuko bows and runs back to the kitchen.</p><p>"oke team 7 meet me at training ground 7 tomorrow morning oh and don't eat you'll just puke." And kakashi dissapears in a sunshin.</p><p>*next day*</p><p>naruto sat in a high three at 7 am reading his fathers latest letter.</p><p>"/ heey kiddo, heard from the geezer 8 tailed tribe leader mamoru that you kept the tribes good the last 2 years.

The 3 gennin shoot up and turn around facing their sensei "DON'T SCARE US LIKE THAT KASHI!" naruto and hinata shout sasuke just nods angry. Kakashi just eye smiles and waves " ma ma just get along to the tower sandaime-sama already knows you passed he asked me to pass you now"</p><p>"so no bel €test then?" naruto asks kakashi nods " no bel test naruto"</p><p>the boy looks at the silver haired jounin and smiles "let's go then</p><p>"KAKASHI!
