I don't know what Couple i'll use but i'll just go with the more popular one as the story continues.</p><p>Dinner Plans Chapter 1</p><p>Naruto Uzumaki opened the door to his duplex apartment only to be greeted by darkness; usually Kyuubi would at least keep the lights on, meaning he was probably out or sleeping. Shifting the groceries in his hands Naruto walked in and closed the door, the dark completely surrounding him "I'm home." The blonde called out into the darkness sliding his sandals off at the door.</p><p>"Welcome back" a voice called from the shadows. Naruto looked up and peered cautiously around the dark living room, "hello?" he continued to watch for a shift of movement "do you want something?"<br>When the voice didn't respond, Naruto nerves twitches anxiously, slowly the blue eyed teen began to feel for the light switch on the smooth walls.</p><p>A warm hand tan brushed against a cool pale one, pulling back Naruto shuddered, there was some one there. Bringing his free hand to his chest Naruto looked around again searching for a figure outlined in the darkness. Slowly Sasuke Uchiha made his way from out the shadows smirking happily at Naruto illuminated by the sole light of the moon light streaming though the blinds.<br>"Hi Naruto"</p><p>"What the- , Sasuke?" Naruto's azure eyes were huge and the bag had managed to slip from his grip as he stood motionless staring at his old team member. The blonde reached forward and touched Sasuke's face, as if expecting it to disappear in a puff of smoke.</p><p>"You were with Orochimaru" He said his hands continuing to rub Sasuke's face in disbelieve.</p><p>" I'm sorry I left", the dark haired boy whispered pulling the shorter boy into his arms.</p><p>"I forgive you." He whispered back into the pale teen's ear. It had finally happened Sasuke came back to the leaf village after all these years. "That's good" Sasuke said in a sigh of relief.</p><p>Though Naruto would never admit it, Sasuke broke his heart. Though the blonde teen searched for him his feelings had slowly began to disappear. Naruto wiped his tears trying to hide them from Sasuke, It was weird he was getting all choked up over his return when he promised himself it would be like a friend returning for a long vacation. "How'd you get away?" he asked.</p><p>Sasuke looked down at the crying boy. "I killed him." He stated simply. "That was my plan all along, after he trained me I'd kill him."</p><p>The blonde nodded sighing into Sasuke's shirt. He smelt nice like strawberries, a soft gentle smell that made the blonde want to close his eyes and sleep.</p><p>Sasuke petted Naruto's soft golden locks enjoying the feeling of the blonde in his arms just a bit longer before slowly releasing him.</p><p>Once Naruto was free he flipped the light on and noticed Sasuke' wince meaning he probably wasn't used to the brightness. "I can turn them off if they annoy you?"</p><p>Sasuke shook his head "it's ok."<p>The blue eyed male nodded picking up the groceries. "Sasuke, have you seen Kyuubi?" He said looking around not sensing the kitsune's chakra</p><p>"Oh he went out." Sasuke said with a small smirk. Naruto looked back at him slightly puzzled by the mischievous look in his eyes.</p><p>"Well I guess he was hungry." The blonde said shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>Naruto slowly made his way into the kitchen placing the bags on his table.<br>"You can watch TV in the living room Sasuke. I'll treat you to dinner." he said.</p><p>Sasuke sat on the couch grabbing the remote relaxing. "Ok"</p><p>Naruto hummed to him self as he cooked a full anti ramen meal. It seemed that though Kyuubi used to live in his body the male really disliked it. Since the two lived together Naruto learned to enjoy other things.</p><p>"I'm back." a voice called from the door.</p><p>"Welcome back Kyuubi "Naruto called from the kitchen.</p><p>The tall male took off his coat and hung it up kicking off his sandals. "Naruto who's the emo on the sofa?" He asked gesturing to Sasuke.</p><p>Looking back Naruto peered at the Kyuubi "Oh that's Sasuke, you know the guy in the picture." He said stirring the beef being careful not to but the searing meat.</p><p>"Oh that's great the fan girl magnet. Lock the door." Kyuubi said annoyed putting the locks on the door.</p><p>"That's not nice you know." Sasuke said.</p><p>Kyuubi looked at the Raven throwing him a dirty look. "Quiet uke boy." He said aggressively.</p><p>Sasuke Glared at the male annoyed, the red head was really on his nerves if it wasn't enough that the male has stolen his beloved blonde, he was insulting him now as well. "You have a problem?" The raven growled out.</p><p>Kyuubi gave the boy an icy stare. "Yea I do actually." He said straightening him self baring his fangs. Sasuke clenched his fist and prepared to jump off the couch waiting for the demon to make the first move.</p><p>"Then why don't you solve it?"</p><p>Kyuubi's chakra flickered slightly. "I was just thinking that myself."</p><p>Naruto watched the two, Kyuubi's face was in an upper pissed expression and his looked like he was ready to tear the raven apart. Sasuke on the other hand was trying not to seem flustered by Kyuubi's show of testosterone but it was obvious he was. His eyes held deep anger and hatred and Naruto could tell that either male could jump at any moment.</p><p>Kyuubi Glared at Sasuke and the two stared in a dead lock for a while before Sasuke's stomach grumbled in protest.</p><p>"Neh that's enough now!" Naruto shouted from the Dinning room setting the table for dinner. "You two go wash up!"</p><p>Sasuke smirked "You've turned into a mother I see dobe." He said.</p><p>Naruto glared and him before pouring drink into cups and serving food ignoring the raven hair comment.</p><p>Had Sasuke said that when they were in the same team the blonde would of gone off but since he was older and wiser and wasn't sure whether or not Sasuke could kick his butt he chose not to give it any thought.</p><p>Kyuubi went to the bathroom hall and washed his hands and face, Sasuke glanced at him and spotted him fixing his appearance as well as hair. It made him wonder, 'who was he fixing up for?'</p><p>Cautiously Sasuke washed his hands as well sparing looks at Naruto occasionally when he knew Kyuubi wasn't looking.</p><p>"It's going to get cold!" The blonde shouted sitting after washing his own hands. Kyuubi came over behind Naruto and kissed his cheek tenderly touching each whisker mark sending soft shivers down the boy's body. "Excellent as always." He whispered huskily in the boys ear before nipping on it.</p><p>Naruto shifted uneasily in his chair blushing and Kyuubi walked over to his seat.. "mmm looks good," he said sniffling the food slightly.</p><p>Naruto blushed a bit as Kyuubi gave him a warm spine melting smile.</p><p>"T-thanks." Naruto said fighting to keep himself from getting flustered.</p><p>Sasuke joined the table and felt a bit awkward not knowing what to do.</p><p>"Let's dig in~" Naruto chimed. "I hope you both like it~"</p><p>A/N: This was a remake, i think I want to take out the yo mama bit and make it a bit more aggressive and detailed to emphasis their hate for eachother.</p><p>Like it so far? Tell me.</p><p>I do NOT own the character of Naruto!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Dinner Plans Chapter 2</P><P>Kyuubi cleared his throat smiling evilly at the Uchiha in front of him. "So sauce GAY, what caused you to visit besides wanting to get into my kits pants." The Demon said frankly.</P><P>Naruto swallow hard and made notion to protest when Kyuubi turned and smiled at him giving him a gentle shut up look. The azure eyed boy looked down blushing before returning to the food in front of him.</P><P>Sasuke glared at the red head who smiled seductively in response. "What am I being too blunt?" He said his smirk widening. "Is that the problem Uchiha?"</P><P>Sasuke like Naruto just looked down and returned to the meal in front of his picking up his chop sticks and trying the beef and rice.</P><P>He chewed slowly enjoying the flavor closing his eyes keeping his sight from</P><P>Kyuubi. He swallowed "Amazing Naruto simply amazing."</P><P>The blonde blushed violently and Kyuubi scoffed. "What do expect from my kit?" leaning closer to the smaller male Kyuubi stole a kiss from him taking the beef from right out of his mouth. "Delicious as always..."</P><P>Sasuke's eyes narrowed and he glared at Kyuubi. How dare that demon kiss HIS Naruto but then again the really question was what was Kyuubi talking about, the food or his little blonde Naru chan.</P><P>"K-Kyuubi..." Naruto whimpered turning his head away from the demon. Kyuubi gently touched his chin bringing his attention back to him. "You aren't embarrassed are you, kit. I know I haven't touched you in a while but I'll make it up to you tonight." With that Kyuubi captured the blonde's lips one more time sneaking a small glance at the infuriated Uchiha who just continued to eat.</P><P>Naruto pulled his face away. "We have guest."</P><P>Kyuubi smirked "that never stopped us before."</P><P>Sasuke glared down at the table. What exactly was he witnessing?</P><P>"Are you guys-" He began.</P><P>Both Naruto and Kyuubi turned their attention to the raven haired teen.</P><P>"Lovers." Kyuubi stated simply, Naruto's face heating up again.</P><P>Sasuke looked up clenching his fist resisting the urge to kick Kyuubi hard under the table.</P><P>The pissed raven returned to his food and the dinner returned awkwardly as Kyuubi made comments of Naruto and his sexual features.</P><P>By the time they made it to desert the only thing the Uchiha male could think of was new erotic ways to drizzle the caramel and fudge on the uke blonde.</P><P>Sasuke watched in slight interest as the Kyuubi began to lick and nip at the spoon taking the vanilla and toppings off. Surprisingly the blonde was watching as well both completely mesmerized.</P><P>Sasuke felt his cheeks flare up and Kyuubi's lustful gaze caught his own. He looked at his lips. Those smirking lips were taunting him.</P><P>"You know it's funny."</P><P>Kyuubi said breaking the two teen trances. "I never craved for sweet stuff until you Naruto. The dark chocolate really brings out the flavor of the Vanilla."</P><P>Naruto blushed coyly "you give me too much praise Kyuubi."</P><P>Kyuubi licked his lips removing some of the desert "oh the contrary. I don't give you enough, Kit. By far you are the most beautiful, amazing, and caring and lavishing lover I have ever had."</P><P>The blonde's face heated up so it resembled the kitsune's striking crimson hair. Sasuke looked from Kyuubi to Naruto then back to Kyuubi again "I think I should go…" he whispered light getting up from the table, His eyes tearing slightly.</P><P>"Thank you for dinner. It was great…" Sasuke turned from the couple and went to pick up his shoes.</P><P>"Feel free to stop by again." Kyuubi said kisses the blonde and Sasuke fled from the house.</P><P>What was wrong with him this wasn't like him? Getting all riled up over some guy. He was an Uchiha damn it and Uchiha's weren't gay! Sasuke wiped his eyes removing the salt water clouding his gaze.</P><P>No one knew he was in the village so he might as well keep it that way. That's when he ran into something familiar. There standing outside of the Uchiha mansion was the very odd member of the rookie 9. Shino Aburame. Sasuke stared at him from the shadows for a few minutes and when he didn't move any his curiosity got the best of him.</P><P>"Shino?" he questioned sliding from behind the shielding tree. "Why are you here?" Shino turned slowly looking at the Uchiha from behind his shades "Sa-Sasuke?"</P><P>Shino pulled off his glasses in disbelief so Sasuke could see his light brown eyes. "What are you doing back here?"</P><P>Sasuke looked at him queerly. "Shouldn't I be asking that question?" Shino nodded "Well I asked first. Sasuke looked left the right then made his way past Shino to the door. "Let's talk inside…"</P><P>"Ah… Kyuubi what are you doing." The blonde asked watching the taller male clean the kitchen. Kyuubi smirked to himself "I'm taking care of my kit. Now you go and take a nice relaxing shower and I'll come join you after I finish cleaning."</P><P>Naruto sighed and rubbed his shoulders. "If you're sure…" turning Kyuubi leaned in and kissed Naruto's forehead "positive."</P><P>The blonde blushed and went off the bathroom, Kyuubi finishing the kitchen.</P><P>It was funny the two had been lovers for about 3 years now but he never felt closer to the red head. It almost made him remember all the evenings they spent cuddling on the couch and kissing on the beach.</P><P>He felt his face inflame once again and he shook his head. It wasn't time to think like that. The last thing he needed was for Kyuubi to see him like this, Vulnerable.</P><P>Turning the pipe hot water erupted from the spout filling the tub slowly. Walking over to the cabinet Naruto pulled out the Lavender candles and bath salts.</P><P>You see lavender was Kyuubi's favorite scent. When ever Naruto took a bath in it, Kyuubi would spend all night sniffing him. That's one of the reasons he changed his shampoo though he changed it back when his golden lock weren't as shiny.</P><P>He lit the candles and dimmed the lights. Running the soap in the water along with the crystals the room encasing it self with the lavender scent. Naruto breathed in and closed his eyes. Relaxing a bit her took off his clothes turned off the pipe and slid into the tub.</P><P>This was the first time Naruto had allowed himself such a guilty pleasure. It wasn't often the blonde could just relax and lounge about; He was usually busy training or learning new recipes for Kyuubi.</P><P>Strong hands gripped his shoulders working the muscles gently. "Feel better?" Kyuubi's deep voice asked.</P><P>Naruto closed his eyes and let out a soft sigh in delight. "Much."</P><P>Kyuubi smirked and continued to massage the tense muscle. "Well I have something that will make you feel great." He said.</P><P>Naruto opened one eye and looked up to see that Kyuubi had placed a can of whipped cream at the edge of the tub, insuring that the two wouldn't have any sleep that night.</P><P>A/N: should I continue? Or no? Let me know please.</P><P>Should I write out the smut in the next chapter? Or onward to more plot?</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Naruto is owned by Masashi Kishimoto</P><P>Naruto: 17</P><P>Kyuubi: 22</P><P>Previous: Naruto opened one eye and looked up to see that Kyuubi had placed a can of whipped cream at the edge of the tub, insuring that the two wouldn't have any sleep that night.</P><P>Chapter 3</P><P>Naruto's eyes widened and he looked down with slightly pink cheeks. "Will you wash my hair for me?" The blonde asked the older male. Kyuubi blinked at his lover a bit astonished "Alright." He smiled softly.</P><P>Kyuubi took the shampoo from the little basket near the head of the tub and poured some in his hand. He took a deep breath, Lavender. Carefully as the Kitsune's lover leaned back he started to lather his hair gently massaging his scalp making sure not to use his nails.</P><P>Naruto moaned lightly feeling Kyuubi's hand massage his locks, usually Naruto would wash his hair himself considering his sensitive scalp but tonight, tonight was different.</P><P>As his lover's hands worked their magic Naruto closed his eyes enjoying Kyuubi's company. Though Naruto wouldn't deny that he would do anything for his lover. When Kyuubi was released from his body it was his salvation and the Kitsune had promised never to leave the blonde alone again.</P><P>Naruto snapped back into reality when his lover's lips found his own. Kissing him gently tasting the sweetness which was the desert the blonde had prepared earlier, the sweet taste of Vanilla and dark chocolate. Naruto let out a soft moan as Kyuubi's strong tongue rolled in his mouth, stealing away every taste of desert. Not too long after there was nothing but Naruto left. Kyuubi loved that taste more. It was awkward kissing in that position so the blonde stood unsteadily turning on the shower, rinsing himself his face red from the heated kiss. Kyuubi watched this interestedly as chuckled. The blonde struggled to condition his locks and finish his shower.</P><P>With out being asked Kyuubi stripped himself IMMEDIATELY stealing the blonde's attention. Kyuubi had a body that was for damn sure; a perfect gorgeous body, toned and muscled with not one battle scar. His hair was stunning, down to his waist and the color of fresh blood a color mimicked by his eyes, those intense sensual eyes that have seen so much pain eyes that made Naruto quiver every time Kyuubi graced him with his attention.</P><P>As if on cue Kyuubi looked at the blonde a smirk playing on his lips delighted with the response from his blonde, happily the man got into the bath with his lover. As always Kyuubi Praised Naruto's body starting from the oh-so perfect blonde locks down to those smooth tan legs. Kyuubi showered the blonde with endearing kisses, on his neck marking him in places his saw fit drawing deliciously loud moans from his lover that were swallowed up by the spray.</P><P>Naruto took a shaky breath Kyuubi's erection was pressing against his back hard and ready, the blonde swallowed harder and turned tippy toeing to kiss the males broad shoulders. Kyuubi bent down to capture Naruto's lips letting out a soft moan of desire as he licked the blonde's lower lip seeking entrance into the sweet cave that was his boyfriend's mouth.</P><P>With a heated sigh Naruto granted it to him. The two kissed at a slow steady rhythm, Kyuubi completely dominating his uke as his tongue caressed the others male's mouth. Naruto pressed against Kyuubi creating a friction of Kyuubi's length against his stomach. That was more than enough foreplay for the two. It always was short but intimate.</P><P>Kyuubi stirred a fire in Naruto that no one could ever extinguish. Theolder man drew a heavy palm down the blondes back his fingers seeming to leave a burning feeling before he cupped the firm tan buttocks. "Now." He seemed to growl in an animalistic manner, vocally expressing his needs to his lover. Naruto understood and stumbled back slightly turning off the shower before starting to climb out of the tub. He wasn't fast enough of course. The demon scooped him up and dried the blonde before he could say anything. He was gently but hurried as he got the two into the bedroom water evaporating from his skin.</P><P>The blonde looked at him and let out a moan of yearning before pulling him in for a kiss, his own member was hardening as he felt Kyuubi's heavy hands all over his body encouraging him, giving him confidence, and confidence he had. With some deal of effort Naruto pushed Kyuubi's shoulders hard making His lover turn onto his back. A perfect crimson eyebrow wet up questionably but the blonde had already begun kissing down his boyfriend's stomach leaving an enthusiastic trail of kisses as he did so.</P><P>Kyuubi admired his lover's beauty as he went down on him. Those beautiful cerulean orbs so transfixed on what they were doing, that perfect sun kissed skin that was so delicious and so smooth against his, his golden locks that framed his face making him look like an angel though right now Kyuubi was savoring those sinful pink lips, lips that he had kissed so many times, lips that he has had screamed him name, right now lips circling around his length.</P><P>He let out a groan of pleasure as he watched his blonde work his magic, his tongue darting out to taste and tease his man hood, the blonde licked from base to tip blowing gently on the wet patches delighted by the moans he got in response. He held Kyuubi's hips as in place as he could before his took it all in his mouth. Closing his eyes he swallowed up all of Kyuubi's sweet skin bring his hard member down into his throat. He started to bob his head encouraged by his partners pleasure he rolled his tongues in random patterns, his hummed in his throat sending vibrations up into Kyuubi's very core. Naruto felt him grow in his mouth and he pulled the length from his raw pink lips with a pop licking the head giving it loving attention while watching Kyuubi's face.</P><P>The Kitsune let out a ragged breath entranced by the blonde's beauty by the blonde's forwardness; it was turning him on, making him want the male on a different level then their normal love making. Kyuubi took back his charge flipping the two so he could loom over his pray, he held three fingers to the blonde lips his eyes clouded by lust. "Suck." He commanded his arms shaking slightly. He was struggling to contain himself, his ultimate pleasure so close, maybe it was because of the Uchiha's presence but for some reason the great Kyuubi no Yoko felt vulnerable.</P><P>Obediently Naruto took the finger and suckled on them rolling them in his mouth his eyes closed coating them completely with his saliva. Kyuubi played with the fingers in his lover mouth before removing them guiding them down the blonde's body to that delicious entrance where he had found relief so very often. A finger probed the blonde lightly before Kyuubi allowed the slickness to slip in. Naruto let out a breathless sigh of pleasure holding his head back eyes closed, it didn't hurt, it never did Kyuubi never would hurt him.</P><P>Playing the finger in and out of the blonde Kyuubi growled his member aching uncomfortably as he prepared his lover with the utmost care, he wanted to lose control but he couldn't. He licked his lips and the smaller male let out another sweet chorus of moans causing the demon's member throb painfully. He slipped another finger in starting to scissor them stretching the muscle loose playing inside of the tight heat before starting the thrust the finger upwards searching for the blonde's sweet spot.</P><P>With a high pitched mew the blonde arched his back feeling a familiar sensation when Kyuubi pressed against his prostate. Naruto began to pull Kyuubi's hand away licking hot moisture back into his throat as he looked at him with lust filled azure orbs. "No more, I want you in me now." He said slightly aggressively.</P><P>Kyuubi smirked and spread his legs his length fully erect and he positioned himself to enter the blonde. He felt his tip press again his entrance hot tightness encircling. "Ready?" he asked. Naruto nodded fervently raising his hips slightly. "I want you now!" He shouted.</P><P>With a nod Kyuubi made a hard thrust up into his kits tight heat his eyes nearly rolling in the back of his head in pure pleasure. Simultaneously Naruto threw his head back letting out a hot airy moan. Kyuubi leaned in and began his pace, fast and dangerous hitting up deep inside of the blonde his body tingling in excitement as he felt himself fully sheathed. Under him Naruto clung to the sheet crying out in both pain and pleasure as Kyuubi's fully hard erection moved inside of him.</P><P>Kyuubi watched his lover never moving his eyes from Naruto's face, capturing every second of his beauty of the sweat dripping down his body as he worshipped it with Physical love. As he started to thrust deeper inside of him Naruto opened his eyes to stare into Kyuubi's. He let out moans of appreciation holding onto Kyuubi's shoulders as if his life depended on it. The Kitsune pounded deeper finally hitting the blonde g-spot ramming against it, trying to milk an orgasm from his mate. Sneaking a hand down he started to pump Naruto's length, toying with the flesh as he moved at a increasing pace starting to move his hand same place.</P><P>"O-Oh God Kyuubi!" The blonde shouted breathlessly, feeling him self being pushed over the edge of passion. The Red head leaned down to steal a sweet kiss from his lover fascinated at the deeper angle. Kyuubi Ravished the blonde's mouth his hand never loosing pace and he continued to thrust into his blonde's tight heat. His member began to throb with the need to cum and pulled back from the blondes lips down to his neck starting to suck on one spot remarking his kit.</P><P>Naruto screamed loudly so close to his ultimate pleasure feeling like he was about to have a thousand deaths. His body quivered under his lover's as he tried to control himself, but there was no use he was being swept away the wild fire spreading.</P><P>Growling in his ear Kyuubi spread Naruto legs wider placing them on his shoulders ramming deep within him. "Don't you cum. don't you Dare cum." He said lowly his movements become more aggressive more animalistic. Naruto didn't think he could take anymore. The blonde threw his head back and cursed. His body moved to meet his partnered covered with sweat the satin sheets clinging to his back. His erection rubbed painfully against Kyuubi's abs as he stopped stroking him and his eyes were closed tightly.</P><P>"Who do you love?" Kyuubi asked the blonde hitting his sweet spot. "Who makes you feel good?" he asked closing his eyes rocking deeper into the blonde unable to slow down.</P><P>"Y-You Oh God Y-You! You and O-Only YOU!" the blonde managed to moan out his throat starting to feel raw. Kyuubi leaned in and nibbled the blonde's ear before pulling the blonde into his lap Naruto's legs falling into his arms as he bounced the blonde on his length. "I don't believe you. Make me believe you." Kyuubi Growled into the blonde's ears.</P><P>Naruto screamed out in pleasure his body quivering, shaking, and unable to hold any control over it as Kyuubi made him revisit a new kind of pleasure. "Say my name." the red head demanded. "Scream my name like it's the only word you know."</P><P>Kyuubi's manhood was throbbing hard inside of Naruto he was close, so very close to his ultimate pleasure the blonde's tightness driving him insane. Timidly he heard his lover cry out. "K-Kyuubi"</P><P>With a growl Kyuubi gave a slightly more violent thrust into his blonde. "Say it Louder." He demanded almost going completely insane as he pleased Naruto. "Let the world know you are mine and mine alone."</P><P>Naruto nearly came as Kyuubi started to hit inside harder. The blonde clung to Kyuubi with all he has his pleasure almost too much. "K-KYUUBI!" He screamed as the demon took all of him moving inside at a pace he couldn't keep up with. A pace that made his legs give out in pleasure and his spine feel like it was melting. "OH SWEET KAMI! KYUUBI!" he screamed. He repeated his name religiously as he was pleasured, his body set on a passionate fire. Without being able to say another word the blonde came all over his lover's stomach, his body tightening in euphoria.</P><P>Kyuubi let out an animalistic grunt before he exploded inside of his mate covering Naruto's wall with his seed his throbbing length freed from his painful need, reluctantly his arms quivering. Kyuubi pulled out his softening length slowly, cum leaking down Naruto's legs.</P><P>Unknowingly the blonde had clenched Kyuubi so tightly that he had drawn blood. Naruto flushed before crawling off of his weakly and falling onto the bed a sweaty mess. "I-I don't think you've even came that fast." He said breathing heavily the affects of his orgasm still rippling through his system.</P><P>Pulling Naruto closer Kyuubi growled possessively. "Don't get used to it my lover. I will be redeeming my self very VERY soon." The red head said running his hand down His kit's face tenderly, and just like that, both covered in sweat unable to tell whose was whose, both so deeply covered in each other's scent they were ready again.</P><P>In the home of Sasuke Uchiha.</P><P>Sasuke looked at Shino shocked at the boy's sudden confession. "I always have. You were just so…so" Shino looked down his deep voice had emotion breaking through. "After Kiba tossed be aside I felt so vulnerable I couldn't snap back. My father wouldn't even speak to me. I was a disaster."</P><P>Sasuke nodded for the boy to continue. "it was then I remembered you, that thirst for power… that longing for revenge, it made me feel so close to you so alike you." Shino looked up before he took his shades off. "I wanted you and before I knew it, I was walking here every night hoping for acceptance hoping for love that never came."</P><P>"Cut the bullshit." Sasuke said frankly looking at the male. "You want revenge on Kiba, you want some one that will help you with out judging you .Believe me." The Uchiha said darkling. "I'm you're guy."</P><P>Shino looked shocked but placed his shades back on, smirking. "Can't get anything past the last Uchiha can I?"He said smirking. "What's you're payment?"</P><P>The raven hair smirked, leaning back in his chair a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Pay me with his body." He said licking his lips. Shino rolled his eyes behind his glasses unaffected by the suggestive gesture. "No really."</P><P>Sasuke laughed. Why hadn't he ever hung out with the male before? He was fun as hell. "Alright" He said a bit more seriously. "Help me bust up Naruto and Kyuubi."</P><P>Shino nodded. "done." He said desperate for revenge.</P><P>The two started plotting late into the night, stopping taking breaks to switch over plans and stretch their legs. The made a pretty good team Sasuke thought. Shino had a dark side, a side the Uchiha was getting to know very well. He also had a soft spot though, one that Kiba fully penetrated and left broken. What a sick puppy. Sasuke yawned and rolled over. Sleep threatening to consume him. "May I stay here for the night?" Shino asked the Uchiha curiously.</P><P>Sasuke yawned falling asleep as they spoke, the toll of the day finally setting in. "Sure, fine a spot to crash." He said his head feeling heavy against the pillow.</P><P>"Thank you."</P>
