severely weakened by the sound/sand invasion, giving Sasuke Uchiha
the chance to defect during the night. It had been two days since
then the retrieval team had left the only one left was Naruto
Uzumaki.</P><P>……………………..</P><P>Sakura Haruno stood at
the gates of Konoha waiting for her teammate to bring Sasuke back to
her. Her eyes where red and puffy as she had been crying over her
'Sasuke-kun' for days, she had watched as the others returned and
knew that Sasuke would be back soon.</P><P>……………………..</P><P>Naruto limped down the
path to Konoha which was just barely visible in the distance, his
vision was blurry and he could feel his consciousness being to fade
in and out. His hair was matted down with dry blood; his face was
pale and covered in multiple cuts and bruises, he had a large
third-degree burn that covered the upper-right side of his face
completely destroying his eye and blood ran down his chin covering
it. His jumpsuit was covered in burns, torn to shreds, and stained
red from blood flowing out of the multiple cuts and gashes that
covered his body; the most noticeable wound was a fist sized hole
that went clean through his chest.</P><P>He felt heavy, his left
arm was numb, and his legs felt like jelly and the fact he was caring
an unconscious Sasuke on his back wasn't helping. Sasuke was in
much better shape as he only had a few cuts and bruises along with a
swollen jaw.</P><P>He looked down the road
and he could barely see the gates of the village entrance, he could
also see three blurry figures rushing over to him. The first appeared
to be a man with spiky brown and a bandage across his face; the next
also looked to be a man with hair similar to the last but was kept
under his hiate. The last figure was a girl with short pink hair in a
red ninja dress.</P><P>'Sakura-chan' he
thought; his mind barely comprehending his surroundings</P><P>He felt Sasuke being
lifted off his back making it slightly easier to stand; the guard
held Sasuke in a bridle carry he looked to his partner who nodded and
they leapt off in the direction of the hospital completely ignoring
Naruto. Naruto watched as they took his teammate, his friend, his
brother; his attention then shifted back to his pink haired crush.</P><P>"S-saku-ra-ch-an I
k-ep-" he was cut off as a chakra enhanced fist slammed into his
face knocking a few teeth out along with knocking him back multiple
feet and on to his back</P><P>"Naruto you bastard,
I asked you to bring Sasuke-kun back; not almost kill him. Kami are
you that pathetic that you can't even do that simple little thing.
Naruto ever since you were put on my and Sasuke-kun's team you've
done nothing but bring him down. If it wasn't for you Sasuke-kun
would be mine and I wouldn't have to compete with Ino. Naruto I
will worn you once if you ever come near me or my Sasuke-kun again I
will kill you where you stand." She threatened her voice heavy with
venom as she too took off for the hospital.</P><P>Naruto watched as his
crush ran off to his rival. On the inside he felt broken; his love,
the person he had devoted his ninja life to protecting had just
openly told him if he came close to her she would kill him; after he
could no longer see her form he began to give-up but he remembered
all the people that did care like Tsunade, Jiraiya, Kakashi, Iruka,
and the other members of the rookie 9. He then knew he had to make it
to them to his real precious people.</P><P>He tried to stand only
for his good arm to be able to lift him solely by its self. He began
to crawl to the guard station using a chair he began to lift himself
to a hunched over state his arm against the table his only support
till he stood upright. He tried to walk only to find his legs would
not support his weight; he pushed him self against the wall using it
for support. He could feel his legs tighten underneath him and he
knew he had only a few minutes till his legs were completely useless.</P><P>As he moved through the
village people would glare and mutter about 'demons and dirtying
their village with its vial blood' a few would even trip him
causing him to have to get upright again. As he moved through a few
would even throw stones and other items they found on the ground. But
he wouldn't let them stop him.</P><P>……………………..</P><P>Kurenai and her team
sat at Konoha's best dango shop with her best friend Anko
Mitarashi. They had heard about the retrieval mission from Shino. The
reason the group had gone out to lunch was while Shino would not show
it Kurenai could tell that he was disappointed to not have gone and
she wanted to cheer him up.</P><P>Their lunch had been
uneventful other than the occasionally blush and faint from Hinata
when Anko would talk about ideas on how she and Hinata should team up
to win Naruto. Kurenai had supported Hinata's crush on Naruto
because she had seen how it had affected her training; she also knew
how Anko had develop a crush on the blond.</P><P>She herself had to
admit that he had grown on her his sun-blonde hair those cerulean
blue eyes that held such depth and unreturned love; those eyes that
were like gates into his soul; a soul that had lived through so much
pain and suffering. At first, she didn't think much of the little
blond boy; she had seen him a few times being kick out of stores and
being picked on by others but never intervened. She only really
paying attention to him after he defeated her student in the Chunin
exam; she suppressed laughing at the interesting victory.</P><P>"Kurenai; do you
smell that?" she was broken out of her thoughts by Anko</P><P>"What"</P><P>"Do you smell that
it; it smells like-"</P><P>"Blood" Kurenai
said cutting her friend off</P><P>Her students look at
her one in worry the other apathetically. The apathetic Shino spoke
first "My bugs say it is coming closer" the group the left the
shop not a moment later; it didn't take them long to find the
source.</P><P>"Naruto-kun"</P><P>………………...</P><P>Naruto's legs had
finally given out leaving him with only his right arm still being
able to move. He tried to move his body grate against Konoha's
gravel roads causing his already bleeding wounds to tear and rip open
worst than before. His eyes could no longer see anything more than
what was more than a foot or so away.</P><P>He could still feel the
rocks being thrown at him by the villagers. He knew that he was in a
hopeless situation e was bleeding more than any human should he
guessed it was Kyuubi's doing. He continued to crawl a his sluggish
pace till he heard a familiar voice</P><P>"Naruto-kun" Hinata
yelled louder than anyone had ever heard her speak before he tried to
look but he could not.</P><P>As the group reached
him they took in the damage he had received. Hinata puked at the
sight of her crush in such a destroyed state; Anko was not much
better off only hold back due to years of training and experience.
Shino looked at his comrade's broken form and could tell his friend
was at deaths door the only thing that kept him in the land of the
living was his unfaltering will. Kurenai looked over his injures he
was bleeding profusely from a large hole in his chest, his right eye
had been burned shut, along with multiple gashes and bruises all
along his body. She could see Hinata beginning to loose consciousness
"Hinata don't faint. We need to get him to the hospital"</P><P>Hinata looked at her
then back to her dieing crush, before steeling her resolve. Anko
lifted Naruto onto her back and they took off for the hospital.</P><P>"Hold on Naruto-kun"</P><P>……………………..</P><P>Naruto could feel
something lifting his body at first he thought it was the warm
embrace of death till he heard</P><P>"Hold on Naruto-kun"
the voice was familiar but he couldn't remember who it was</P><P>……………………..</P><P>The group reached the
hospital in only a few minutes. Inside the hospital was empty except
for the receptionist. Kurenai rushed to in front of the woman.</P><P>"Help he needs a
doctor" the nurse was about to call a doctor till she saw who the
women were carrying; and sneered at them</P><P>"Like hell we help
that filthy demon" the sneer on her face never leaving her face</P><P>Anko was about to beat
the shit out of the nurse till she felt Naruto beginning to slide
off. "Aburame come here I need you to hold Naruto so I can the shit
of this little bitch"</P><P>Shino took Naruto
putting his arm over his own shoulder for support.</P><P>Naruto could feel that
his body had shifted again. He tried to open his eyes only that it
was hard ... harder than most things he had done in his life. When he
did get hi left eye open he could see what looked to be a person in a
gray coat and had spiky brown.</P><P>"W-w-wh-o" his
voice was barely audible. Shino looked at only hearing due to the
close proximity they where in</P><P>"It's Shino;
Naruto"</P><P>Naruto took severally
minutes to respond his brain barely functioning "w-whe-"</P><P>Shino sensing the
question "we're at Konoha's hospital"</P><P>Naruto heard him and
felt relieved at the knowledge he had reached his destination. He
knew that he had only one more thing he had to do.</P><P>"S-sh-shi-n-no" his
voice was growing weaker with every word he forced out</P><P>"Naruto; save your
strength" Shino while it didn't show he was worried for his
friend</P><P>"N-n-no; l-li-s-st-en
I-i ne-e-ed y-ou to-to g-go-o to" he stop because he started to
cough up blood; after it stopped "mu-my h-ho-hou-se i-in mu-my
ro-roo-room t-th-e-re i-is a lo-loo-se f-flo-or-bo-boa-rd i-in t-he
co-cor-ner; u-nd-der ne-eath i-it i-is a-a b-o-ox. B-bri-ng i-it t-to
Ji-ra-rai-ya" His voice could barely be heard after his lengthy
speech</P><P>"Naruto I don't
think I-" he was cut off when Naruto spoke again</P><P>"Please" his voice
was worse than ever</P><P>Shino could hear it in
his voice while it was weak it still held his undeniable
determination. Shino nodded as he helped Naruto in a chair and then
into an upright position.</P><P>"A-ri-g-ga-to-u"
Shino only nodded before running out of the hospital</P><P>'Good bye; my…friend'
Shino thought to himself as a single tear ran down his cheek for the
first time since he had begun his ninja training.</P><P>……………………..</P><P>Kakashi ran through the
streets of Konoha following a trail of blood that Pakkun had
identified as Naruto's. He had been following the trail since they
came across it at the Valley of the End. He saw that since he entered
the village the trails had grown in size. He could see Konoha's
hospital not far off and ran at full speed almost crashing into the
front doors.</P><P>When he entered he
could see Kurenai, Anko, and surprisingly Hinata arguing with the
receptionist. He turned to see his student sitting in a chair to
right his attention was then redirected to the nurse at the desk.</P><P>"Why is Naruto out
here and not being treated" he yelled at the bitchy receptionist</P><P>……………………….</P><P>Pakkun walked over to
Naruto's weak form; he sniffed his leg before jumping into the
chair next to him; he then walked next to his hand giving it a nudge
it responded slightly moving to pet the animal only to fall back
limply back to his side; Pakkun then gave the hand a small lick
before began to speak</P><P>"Sure got your self
fucked up this time gaki" Naruto didn't respond; the only
indication he was alive was the irregular movement of his chest.
Pakkun climbed next to Naruto and rested his head on is bloody thigh.</P><P>"Pa-pa-kun" the dog
could barely hear the voice coming from dieing boy's mouth</P><P>"Naruto you still
there"</P><P>"Pa-ku-un; t-te-ell
Sa-saku-r-ra-ch-cha-an" he stopped as he coughed up more blood "
t-te-ll h-er I ke-pt m-my pr-pro-mi-se o-of a li-lif e t-ti-ime;
pl-e-ease" Pakkun could only nod "A-ri-ga-ga-to-u" his voice
gone as his body fell limply out of the chair and onto the floor; a
small smile on his face the only sign that he died at peace.</P><P>Pakkun turned his
attention to the arguing people. Kakashi had formed his Raikiri and
was threatening to use it on the woman. "Kakashi, stop there is no
point any longer" his usually calm voice was little more than a
growl.</P><P>The group turned to see
the little dog looking at them his lip curled in anger; but no one
actually saw the dog only the now dead Uzumaki Naruto on the floor.</P><P><U><B>PROLOGUE</B></U></P><P><U><B>END</B></U></P><P>Okay that's the first
chapter to my NARU X BLEACH.</P><P>Review I want the help</P>
