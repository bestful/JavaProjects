you like it</p><P>i dont own naruto</p><P>why. why was all the young man could
think. why was he being beaten by these strangers every night? why
was everything blamed on him. all he would here was "you are the
scum of the earth shi-ne!"..."why couldn't you have just
jumped of a cliff and save us the trouble demon-brat". after
about 10 more minutes, they disided they where bored with beathing up
this "pathetic exuse for a life" and went to find the
closes shinobi bar and drown there sorrows in a pint. We now cut to
the victim, 15 year-old naruto just laying there on the ground with a
stotic face and his eyes glazed over almost if like all his body is
just a emty vessel with no soul or emotion in it. The people never
really hurt him, because naruto was not a normal human or human at
all no, he was a half-demon. a son of the shinigami who's child is
told to have unimaginable power.as he lifts himself up he heads
toward the outskirts of konoha toward training area 44 of the "forest
of death" as he heard some jounin's call it. he just sighs as he
looks to his left and his right to se if anyone is near, even going
to the extent of checking for any chakra in the imidiate vincinity.
as soon as naruto deemed it safe, he disappeared without a trace in a
flash. we cut to the forest of death to find naruto appear in another
flash. he just walks silently into the forest blasting a giant snake
with a blast of his deadly charkra. the village didn't know that
naruto was powerful enough to destroy this village with two fingers.
he finds a tree and lets sleep consume him giving him his only solace
that his miserable life will alow him.</p><P>naruto doesnt look like the average
citizen of konoha. he is wearing a black version of his origanal
clothes. the reason he wore the orange when he was younger was
because he wanted to stand out, to be noticed. now he has grown up
and droped the mask of happyiness realizing now that all people will
see is the "demon-brat"</p><P>naruto awoke to the sun shining in his
eyes temporalaly blinding him. he jumped out of the tree and landed
with little to no noise</p><P>"lets see what shit can go wrong
today" he grimly thought.</p><P>he made his way over to a hot spring he
found when he started sleeping in the forest because his last
sleeping spot has been found out by the villagers. the demon doesn't
deserve a good nights sleep right?. he stripped down and jumped in
just trying to forget all his troubles.</p><P>"well, at least it cant get any
worse" and as if on que he heard "i saw him! i saw the
demon go in there!" "alright men, split up and when you
find him kill him and despose of the body". "but sir"
said another man "what if the gondaime finds out, he'll strip us
of his rank and kill us! you know he knows that brat pretty well..."
"we will tell the hokage that we saw him leave the village and
we couldnt catch up to him" the original man replied.</p><P>"oh fuck me" naruto said with
a sigh and he hops out and gets dressed while getting ready to
hirashin to his destination for today: the hokage tower. he makes it
to the tower effortlessly. good morning naruto she says with a true
wholesome smile, something that is rair for me. if there was a reason
i stay in this village and put up with this torment is tsunade. the
well-endowed hokage is the only one i dont want to kill. she makes
life a little better. i go to her office every 3-4 days to just sit
down and talk. it would be nice to think that tsunade talks to me
because she wants to but i can see that see just talks to me and
makes me feel better so i dont just snap and kill everyone in sight.
i realized this the first time i talked to her. when you live with a
beating around every corner, you get to read people real fuckin'
quick.</p><P>"how are you naruto-kun?" she
asked</p><P>"..."</p><P>"I saw that the villagers burned
down your house, where do you live know?"</p><P>"..."</p><P>"naruto-kun, why dont you answer?"</p><P>i just get up and walk out without
saying anything.</p><P>"naruto-kun, where are you going?"</p><P>"...food"</p><P>"i'll go with you"</p><P>i just keep on going not really carring
if she comes or not. as im walking I get the same hateful glare that
i get day after day. actually, today was different someone actually
threw a rock straight at my head. it hits its mark and i just keep
walking, i dont even notice the pain because im so used to it. i
didnt care, all they were doing was digging a bigger hole for
themselfs. tsunade didnt really take to the rock throwing as well as
i did. i didnt even look back, all i heard was a high pitch screem
and a huge crash before she caught up to me. she gave me a smile when
i looked at her. i wanted to smile back but i didnt have the will. so
i just stared at her with my usual expressionless face of mine. for a
minute i see a pang of guilt in her eyes before she looks away. we
keep walking pass the market district and pass the resturant
district. we keep on walking until she finnaly asked "where are
we going?"</p><P>i dont answer and keep walking. until i
reach the forest and i throw a kunai at a bush. i walk over and grab
my original target, the rabbit. tsunade looks at me with a imanginary
question mark on her forhead but her question is soon answered when i
take a bite out of the rabbit. she looks at me horrified until i eat
the whole thing.</p><P>"..." her mouth was open but
nothing was comming out.</p><P>i just stare at her, suddenly she grabs
my hand and drags me toward konoha</p><P>"im getting you some real food"</p><P>she draged me to some place i didnt
recognize and demanded some food, the man at the register just glared
at me and a glared right fuckin' back showing my now red slited eyes
from absorbing the kyuubi. he just looked away and gave her the food.
we went back to her office to eat. she dug in and i just stared into
space.</p><P>"what's wrong naruto-kun? do you
not like it?</p><P>i just sniff it and throw it in the
trash.</p><P>"why did you do that?" she
said with a slight hint of rage in her voice</p><P>"...poison"</p><P>"...oh.." she said while
looking at the ground in shame</p><P>"goodbye hokage-sama"</p><P>she watched as naruto walked out with
one thought on her mind "<I>he didn't call me obaa-chan"</I></p><P>please read and review, flames are
accepted</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>hey everyone! im sorry that it has been
so long and i have no excuse exept for pure laziness and me being
constantly overtired. also, i have a poll: im already making naruto
with kyuubi as a pairing but should i add another girl(and i mean
ONE) and if so, who should it be? i will let you diside, anyone exept
sakura, hanabi, moegi, tsunade. you know, all the ones that are taboo
or is just a bitch.</p><P>and another poll: who thinks sakura is
a bitch?</p><P>2 weeks later...</p><P>naruto was walking toward his teams
meeting spot, recieving hateful glares along the way. as he is
walking, he thinks back to the event that finnaly broke him, the
event that made him an empty shell...</p><P>FLASHBACK 1 MONTH AGO...</p><P><I>naruto was walking towards his teams
usuall meeting spot for a B-rank mission with the rest of team 7. he
sees what he sees every day, kakashi reading his beloved porn and
sakura still sucking up to sasuke. he chuckles to himself thinking
'somethings never change'. he sees sakura get turned down once again
and go sit on a rock away from the team. now being the nice guy that
the is, he goes and sees whats wrong and tries to comfort her.<BR></I></p><P><I>"are you ok sakura-chan?</I></p><P><I>"..."</I></p><P><I>"you should give up on sasuke,
he is never going to aknowledge you, so why dont you move on, sasuke
is just an asshole"</I></p><P><I>now being the queen of bitchiness
that sakura is, no one is going to insult HER sasuke-kun so she says
the sentence that would change naruto's life forever.</I></p><P><I>"WHAT DO YOU KNOW NARUTO-BAKA!
SASUKE-KUN IS WAY BETTER THAN YOU, HE HAS PEOPLE THAT ADORE HIM, WHAT
DO YOU HAVE NARUTO? NO ONE THATS WHAT! NO ONE WOULD CARE IF YOU
DIED!"</I></p><P><I>that did it, that broke naruto's
soul. no matter how he played it in his mind, she was right, he had
no one. after she said that, her eyes widened as what she said sank
in. she started and apology but i wouldnt give her a chance, i just
walked away. i felt a hand on my shoulder; it was sasuke.</I></p><P><I>"what, the dobe cant take a
little put down from a girl, huh? you will always be we...</I></p><P><I>he didnt get to finish as naruto
slamed his fist into his stomach, knocking the wind out of sasuke
making him keel over. naruto continues to walk away with sakura
screaming at him. he paid her no mind as he went to the forest of
death to do some serious thinking.</I></p><P><I>END FLASHBACK</I></p><P>durring that time, his house was burned
down by a determined villager. ever since then he has been training
non-stop, useing his fathers scrolls he got from the hokage. he knew
who his father was, his father was the yondaime hokage, the greatest
ninja ever produced in this village, but what people didnt know was
that his father was the shinigami, the death god. he used up the rest
of his little remaining power in human form to seal the great Kyuubi
no Kitsune. he then resumed his position as shinigami.</p><P>After using the kitsune's chakra so
much, he found out that the attack on the village was on purpose,
apparantly stated in her own words: "i saw such a pretty
village, i had to knock it down". naruto didnt even berate her
for doing it because he hates the village as much as she does..</p><P>as we see our hero leap from the tree
he thinks "this village will <I>burn</I>".</p><P>please read and review, flames are

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>hi everybody! i have
discided to ubdate the story as soon as posible and to TRY and fix my
grammer. it gets a little hard because i am using wordpad because i
dont feel like paying $200 for the product key for microsoft word. On
another note, keep on voting on the two polls!(sakurabitch and
another girl for naruto).So anyway...enjoy.</p><P>We find naruto walking
down the street recieving hateful glares from the populace of konoha.
hey just chuckles to himself thinking "i cant wait to wipe the
glares off there face and replace them with looks of terror as I'm
killing them off like little flies". He smiles darkly as he
continues his walk toward the place where his "teamates"
are meeting.</p><P>as he arrives at the
trainig grounds, sakura imediatly repremands him for something he
cant remember doing. "pinky's the first one to go" he
thinks as he tunes out his bitchy teamate. he settles under a tree
and disides to take a light snooze before his pitiful exuse for a
sensei arrives...</p><P>CUT TO MINDSCAPE</p><P>as he comes to in the
sewer he is all to familiar with and walks over to the gate that
contains his only companion and lover.</p><P>"<B>greetings
naruto-kun"</B> she says. naruto walks over to the cage and
see's the women he loves. kyuubi is dressed in a long kimono that is
barely conceiling her...assetts. the kimono is completely black
with a great fox head on the back. kyuubi herself has flaming red
hair that reaches the small of her back, milky white skin due to all
the years in the seal with no sun, and a pair of fangs that would
instill fear into all accept her container.</p><P>"hello kyu-chan"
he says as he walks over into the cage to greet her. She saunters
over to HER naruto-kun and says "<B>naruto-kuuuuun, why dont you
visit more often, it gets sooooo lonely in here"</B> she
procedes to fiercely kiss him, expressing her need fr her naruto-kun.</p><P>"woah" was all
he could say. after he pulls himself out of his stupor he remembers
the reason why he came. "oi, kyu-chan, the day is drawing close
where konoha becomes nothing more than a crater of blood and ash"
he says with an insane smile which for an odd reason, kyuubi find
incredebly sexy."<B>hai, naruto-kun, i cant wait to see you in
all that pretty blood...". </B>he smiles and gives her the
smallest of kisses and says "kakashi-teme is here, i got to go"
and with that he left her in flash leaving her to
do...whatever she does in the darkness of the seal.</p><P>CUT TO REAL WORLD</p><P>he awakes to kakashi and
sasu-gay staring at him. he opens his eyes for them to see blood-red
eyes where the deep blue ones once were, frightening them and making
them back away. he catches a look his sensei gives him "i came
to tell you that i have quit this team and i do not intend to see any
of your faces again" and with that, by a feat of pure speed,
dissapears leaving the others speechless.</p><P>we find him back in the
forest of death standing in a clearing. "i hope you like my gift
kyu-chan" with that he makes the ram seal while shouting
"SHIKIFUUIN KAI!" a great flash of light covers the entire
clearing and remains until it clears and a feminine figure emerges.</p><P>"welcome back to the
planet earth kyu-chan."</p><P>hey everyone, i just want
to remind you to vote on another girl because if i dont get any
within the next few chapters, he is going to stick with kyuubi. on
another note, please vote if sakurabitch.</p><P>also, i need a beta reader
for this story because i cant find all the kinks i need to work out.
so just email me at: R and R flames are
