takes place post time skip, but I doubt there be spoiler</p><P>THIS
IS A FEMKYUUBY FIC NO YAOI!</p><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><P>He
didn't remember when his addiction started, maybe those lonely
nights when ero-sennin was peaking, drinking and going to brothel
houses, but he knew he couldn't get enough. Her blood red hair that
always smell of lilies, her blood red eyes, her full lips that always
laid those rough and forceful kisses or those soft and tender
depending on her mood. He loves her she is his addition but he could
help wondering what she thought of him, was he really what she said
he was of her nothing but a pet.</p><P>He
was shaken of his thought by the voice of is love</p><P>"<U>Why
so deep in thought my pet" Kyuuby asked</U></p><P>'I
am not your pet' he thought but he knew he would never said that
she was his addiction his everything.</p><P>"Nothing
wrong my love" he said his blue eyes, bluer then the sky said
something different.</p><P><U>"Don't
lie to me tell me what wrong my pet" She said </U></p><P>"I
am not your pet, is that all I am to you? He asked his voiced
sounding hurt.</p><P>She
narrowed her eyes at him and asked "<U>Aren't
I just a addiction to you?,</U></p><P>Naruto
leaned back as realization hit him while he may say he loves her all
he truly think of her is as am addiction. "Your right, you aren't
my addiction you're my Kyuubi-Hime and I love you.</p><P><U>"And
you are my Naru-chan and I love you" She said, </U>her
voice soft yet carrying such emotion that make his heart flutter and
they kissed soft and tender making him realized he prefers this type
of kiss more.</p><P>And
he realized that while the relation started has a pet/addiction all
that matter his the now and the love he shares with the one he loves.</p><P>The
end</p><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</p><P>I
