This is a must note to people who noticed and spoke up: this takes place awhile after Pain attacked the village, so most of the kids are between 17 and 20. Naruto has never had the memory of using the Kyuubi's power in this one but he had used it before. Also this is only a fan fiction, think of it as a movie. In short IT IS JUST A STORY PEOPLE. Now shall we begin…</P><p style="text-align:center;">The Beginning of the End</P><P>Sunlight lanced through the trees coated in the morning dew and the sounds of animals playing could be heard as Naruto Uzumaki walked through the forest. "Well it sure is peaceful. Too bad I have to waste it searching the damn woods for a lost pet." Naruto came across a pond and stopped to rest and drink. The water was cool and refreshing. He splashed some on his face.</P><P>He looked at his reflection and liked what he saw. Slightly messy yellow hair like his father, Minato and sea-blue eyes showing fiery determination, along with the markings on his face from having the Kyuubi sealed inside him. He stood and his mirrored twin did the same. Naruto never noticed but he had grown a bit since the last time he checked. But the one thing that never changed was the Day-Glo orange clothing he always wore. <I>Not bad at all. </I>He thought.</P><P>He started walking when a noise caught his attention. Swift reflexes from years of training went into motion as he had a kunai in his hand, ready to fight. "Hold on. It's just us." A voice called out from the trees and two figures appeared from the shadows. It was Kakashi Hatake and Sakura Haruno. Kakashi was his gloomy-like boring self as usual, wearing his uniform and looking like he was about to fall asleep. Sakura wore her everyday outfit, a red sleeveless shirt and white shorts, and from the look of it she wasn't in a very happy mood as she came up and struck Naruto square in the face and making him fall into the pond.</P><P>Naruto broke the surface, spitting out water. "What the hell was that for?!" He yelled. "For all the time me and Kakashi-sensei wasted trying to find you, you idiot!" She exclaimed. "We have been looking all morning for you just to find you checking yourself out. I've got have a mind to beat the stupid right out of you." "Easy Sakura, I think he gets it." Kakashi said. He stepped forward and pulled Naruto out. "Okay, at the risk of getting hit in the face again, why are you looking for me?" Naruto asked using his chakra to try and blow the water off him.</P><P>"We were trying to find you so we could tell you that the mission is done. We found the cat and returned it to its owner." Kakashi said. "Also, the Hokage has a new mission for us to take on." <I>God, I hope it isn't another D-ranked one.</I> Naruto thought.</P><P>(Fifteen minutes later)</P><P>The three of them were in the Hokage's office; standing across from them was Tsunade, one of the three Sonnin and current Hokage of Konoha. With long golden yellow hair, size-G breasts and enough power in her right hook to level a building, Tsunade is as lethal as she is drop-dead sexy. "Alright, two hours ago I sent out scouts on their daily check of the perimeter and they found something interesting. One has seen two figures that match the descriptions of rogue ninjas Itachi Uchiha and Kisame Hoshigaki. I want to know what it is that they are doing here and why." She said. "Yes ma'am." They said in unison.</P><P>They turned to leave when Kakashi stopped. "Something's on your mind, isn't it?" He asked. Naruto and Sakura stopped, interested in hearing what their sensei had to say. Tsunade sighed, "It shows that badly?" She said. "Only to those who pay attention, and when you know what to look out for, it helps. What's wrong?" Tsunade stood from her seat and stared out the window. "It's just…we haven't seen these two ninjas in particular for a while and out of nowhere, they just appear. They've seen and followed for the past hour and so far they haven't done any harm. It's been on my mind since I heard they were sighted. That's not the only matter, how is it that two seasoned fighters get seen by rookie scouts in the first place? Something's just not right, and it worries me."</P><P>Nobody moved or said anything for a bit, and then Naruto spoke. "I understand Grandma Tsunade. I know what it's like not to know what's going to happen or what's going on right now. And to make it worse you're the Hokage, you have the great responsibility to the people who live here. You have the right to worry. But that's why people like us, Kakashi-sensei, Sakura and me, are around. No matter what it is, a friend, an enemy, we all have things like this on our minds but in the end, we have to see what it is and face it. So you shouldn't worry, whatever happens we can take it. Believe it!" Tsunade smiled. "Thank you Naruto. I needed that. Now, go and see why it is they are here."</P><P>The gang left and Sakura smiled. "<I>I</I> can't believe it. That is probably the most sense you have ever made while talking like an idiot. And," She said jumping in front of Naruto. Naruto braced himself for another punch instead Sakura hugged him. Naruto blinked, still waiting to get leveled. "It's definitely the nicest thing I've ever heard you say to anyone." She stepped back. And then hit him in the arm. "Ow!" Naruto said rubbing his sore. "But it would have been nicer if you left out calling her "Grandma"!" Sakura said smugly. Kakashi chuckled, "Alright you two, let's get to work."</P><P>(Out in the forest)</P><P>"Alright Itachi, how long do we have to keep pretending that there's no one following us? Those runts are getting on my nerves." Kisame said angrily. "Easy, my comrade, only long enough to find what we're looking for. When we do, then you can have your fun. Until then…we don't harm anyone or anything. " Itachi replied. Kisame sighed, "Okay, have it your way. I'll play nice, for now. But when we're done with this job you owe me."</P><P><B>A/N: </B>Right, well from my point of view I say that's not bad. But hey, I'm the one writing it. It's up to you guys, the readers, to see it its worthy or not. Reviews!</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>A/N: Okay same deal. In this this one there's going to be some decent fight scenes and a small plot twist. See if you can tell what it is. Reviews!</B></P><p style="text-align:center;">Ambush!</P><P>(Two hours later)</P><P>Naruto and the others had been scouting the forest around Konoha, jumping at every broken stick or moving leaf. Sakura and Kakashi had been running around the southern and eastern area while Naruto was checking out the northern area. "This is Sakura sighing in. So far it's been quiet on my end. What about you Naruto, Kakashi-sensei?" Sakura said into her communicator.</P><P>Kakashi was running through some trees and stopped. "There's nothing in the south. It's all quiet." He replied. "Naruto, what about you, have you got anything?"</P><P>Naruto was near a meadow far north of the village, sitting on a rock and keeping watch. "Nothing interesting to tell from my spot so I'm going to move. I'll head towards the western area and start searching from there." He stood and ran through the field. <I>Jeez, I don't get it. Why bother to come at all? And then not do anything but run in a circle. What's their game?</I> Naruto thought. He was so deep in his thoughts that he almost missed a shadow flash by a nearby tree.</P><P>His eyes just caught the movement when another one came from behind. A large shot of water came rushing at him but he managed to evade it at the last second. As he landed another water shot came at him. He jumped and ran as they kept coming, not giving Naruto a chance to retaliate. "Okay, that's enough!" He yelled out and threw down a smoke bomb as he landed again. As fast as he could, he made some hand signs. <B>"Shadow Clone Jutsu!"</B> He yelled and five Narutos appeared, charging out through the smoke to try and confuse who was attacking him.</P><P>Before any of them could get far, ten kunai each were thrown at them and they all disappeared in a wisp of smoke. For a moment all was silent and then a figure came from the trees. Kisame looked around for Naruto. "Argh…where did he go, I was starting to have fun." He growled in anger and swung his sword at a tree, tearing it in two. "He must have run away during the smokescreen while I was busy with the clones. I got to hurry up." He said. With that he ran off in one direction in frenzy.</P><P>A few moments passed and then a nearby rock suddenly transformed into Naruto. "Whew, that was close. I thought he almost had me there. I can't believe that shark-face actually fell for that old trick." He said to himself. He tried to hail the others, only to find that his communicator was broken. <I>Shit! It must have broken when I was dodging the water.</I> He thought. "I have to get to Sakura and Kakashi-sensei before either of those two does!" He said. He turned and started running in the general direction his teammates were, hoping to get there in time.</P><P>(With Sakura)</P><P>"Oh, what's wrong with this thing?! I can't reach Naruto!" Sakura said. She was waiting up in a tree, patiently for Kakashi-sensei to meet her. She kept trying to get Naruto but to no avail. <I>He probably just broke it messing around like always. </I>Sakura thought. Kakashi showed up near a large boulder with moss coming towards her. "Finally," She said, standing up and stretching her tired limbs. "I thought you were going to be late like you always are for a lesson." Kakashi said nothing as he approached her. <I>Hmm, that's strange. </I>She thought. She jumped down to greet her teacher. Sakura came up to Kakashi, "Alright, so for I have seen no sign of the two rogues, nor have I heard anything out of the ordinary." She reported. Kakashi nodded and then stopped, turning his head to the trees behind Sakura. "What is it?" She asked. Preparing herself for an attack she took out a kunai and turned to the woods that surrounded them.</P><P>Right then she had a disturbing feeling and looked to Kakashi to see a fist connect to her head, knocking her out cold. Kakashi caught her as she fell and placed her at the base of a tree. Then a puff of smoke covered him and where Kakashi was, Itachi now stood. <I>One down, two to go. </I>He thought and disappeared.</P><P>Kakashi was heading to Sakura as fast as he could when he ran into Naruto on the way. "Naruto, are you okay?" "Yeah, I'm fine, just tired. I ran into Kisame on my way to the next area. Somehow I got away and I've been running like hell to find you guys before they did." Naruto panted.</P><P>They leaped from tree to tree at full speed while trying to watch out for the rogue ninjas and Sakura. Some time had passed before they managed to locate their fallen comrade. Kakashi placed two fingers to her neck and sighed in relief. "She's okay, just unconscious. We should-" He began when Sakura's eyes opened and swung her fist at Kakashi. He dodged it and jumped on a branch. "Sakura, what the hell do you think you're doing?!" Naruto said. Sakura didn't say anything as she glared at Kakashi with a fierce hatred. "Tell me something, Kakashi-sensei. Tell me something only the three of us would know." She blurted out.</P><P>Kakashi turned his head to the side with confusion, but said nothing. They stared at one another for a while when Kakashi jumped down. He landed near Sakura and slowly walked over to her. Sakura kept her guard up when Kakashi got close and bent over to whisper something in her ear. The look on her face changed from malice to relief. Kakashi leaned back, "Are we good?" He asked. Sakura nodded.</P><P>Naruto came up to them. "What is it? What did you say?" He said. Kakashi turned to Naruto with a grim look in his eye. "That's not important. What is important is finding the two ninjas and finding out why they are here."</P><P>They all told each other's story about their findings. "Alright, let's assume that we know why they are here. Why go through all this trouble of walking aimlessly around the woods for hours on end only to attack one person and knock out the other? It makes no sense." Sakura said.</P><P>"I don't get it either, but the best plan for now, is to wait. Given time, they will come to us." Kakashi said. Naruto and Sakura nodded in agreement and so they waited for the outlaws to find them.</P><P>(Thirty minutes later)</P><P>Two shadows began moving of their own accord and came into view. Itachi and Kisame walked towards the others. Naruto, who was lying on a large branch, was now ready to fight. Kakashi and Sakura stepped away from the tree where Naruto was, Kakashi's hand reaching for his headband while Sakura was preparing herself by flowing chakra through her body.</P><P>"It seems that they have been expecting us. Itachi, can I deal with them now?" Kisame said. Itachi sighed. "Very well, tend to the other two, but make sure not to…unintentionally harm Naruto." Kisame smiled revealing all of his pointed teeth. Kisame drew his sword and laughed. Kakashi stepped forward. "Wait! If you're really so focused on fighting us, at least tell us why!" All eyes were on Itachi who kept silent, his eyes closed. He opened his eyes and stared Kakashi in the eye. "We are here as bounty hunters on a job to capture Naruto and take him with us. That's all you need to know." He said.</P><P>Kisame charged and swung like a madman, his sword aimed for Sakura. She jumped away and Kisame's sword struck the ground with great force, causing dirt to go everywhere. <I>To hell with this! </I>Kakashi thought. He moved away and pushed his headband up, revealing his Sharingan. He vanished in an instant and reappeared behind Kisame, a kunai on hand.</P><P>He aimed for Kisame's neck but missed as Kisame ducked and swung his sword at Kakashi's legs. He jumped over Kisame's head and threw a kunai as he landed and stepped away. Kisame deflected it and laughed. "Is this the best you can do? A child could do better!" He boasted. "Then let's test that theory." Sakura said. She made some hand signs. "<B>Illusion Release!"</B> She called. Several bushes and shrubs disappeared, showing other kunai with tags wrapped around the handles implanted into the ground. Itachi looked around curiously. "Hmm…what is all this?" He spoke.</P><P>"We setup a trap for when you guys got here." Sakura said. "The tags on these kunai are part of a new weapon prototype we had made for a special test run and we decided to try them against you two. The markings on the tags of the kunai placed in a general area can create a powerful water barrier by utilizing the oxygen in the area and combining it with hydrogen that five kunai have sealed in the tags are released into the air. The other five assist by using chakra sealed away to help create the barrier and reinforce it. Even when it has been turned on, the hydrogen gas is still being released inside. By using a second kunai with a stronger-than-normal paper bomb on a time lag after the barrier has been active, it buys time for us to ensure the enemy stays within the area. The beauty of it, the water is so thick that once the explosion happens, it becomes compressed by the barrier and grows stronger in power. In theory no one can escape from it, save for those who have this." Kakashi said holding a kunai with a gold band on it. "This one is special because it can negate the effects of the barrier when it gets close to it, and the effects leave the instant it moves away." Kakashi grabbed Naruto's arm and thrust the kunai into the water. A hole opened up and they flew out into the air and landed in time to see it close back up. They were out of the blast range while Itachi tried to escape, only to be stopped by the powerful barrier.</P><P>He looked at Naruto with a strange light in his eyes then shut them; before a flash covered everything in the area with light then an explosion happened. The ground shook with such force, but the barrier held strong. When it was over the shield had vanished and the kunai were destroyed. But in the mists in the center was an enormous bubble of water. "No!" Naruto exclaimed. "The <B>Water Shield Justu</B>,Kisame must have been able to fuse the gases together just like the kunai." Kakashisaid.</P><P>The bubble burst sending water everywhere, hitting Kakashi and Sakura and knocking them down. Itachi with his eyes still closed, walked towards Naruto who was ready for whatever Itachi had planned. As Naruto was about to charge ahead, a large group of crows surrounded him so he couldn't run. Itachi ran through some hand signs and placed his hand on Naruto. <B>"Way of the Cursed Seal Jutsu."</B> He whispered. Itachi's hand began to glow with an eerie violet light and markings appeared on the back of his hand. All the while Naruto was in a daze and didn't react in the least. Itachi looked over at Kisame. "Hurry up! When I take my hand away from Naruto I'm going to need backup!" He hollered. Just as Kisame began to move, Sakura managed to stand up and attempted to stop him. She threw a chakra-filled punch at his head and missed as Kisame batted her aside. While in midair she threw a shuriken at Itachi causing him to take his hand away from Naruto. The moment he did the markings had disappeared from Itachi's hand and reappeared on Naruto's forehead.</P><P>Nothing happened for a moment, and then the earth started to tremble. The air grew heavy with some kind of pressure everyone could feel. The ground around Naruto's feet cracked and the trembling grew worse. Suddenly out of nowhere, a shockwave of chakra emitted from Naruto blowing everyone away. Dirt and rocks were blasted apart; trees were nearly uprooted from the ground. "What's going on, what the hell did you do to Naruto?!" Kakashi yelled over the destruction. The waves of energy stopped and everyone got a good look at Naruto. He had been transformed: his eyes were crimson-red and the pupils were silted. The whisker marks on his face were more profound. His teeth elongated into fangs and his hands, claws. A dark-red energy swirled around him with no warning and great force.</P><P>Naruto dug his hands into the ground and spun on the spot, sending more rocks flying into Kakashi and the others. They moved, jumped and dodged everything that came their way. <I>What the hell is going on with him? If someone doesn't do something soon, he'll tear up the entire forest!</I> Kakashi thought. Then he stopped. Naruto had stopped, turned and ran away surprising everyone.</P><P>"Where is he going?" Sakura said. She went to go after him but was stopped by a motion from Kakashi. "Wait, in the current state you're in and with Naruto like that, you could get fatally wounded. First things first," He said turning towards Itachi and Kisame. "It's time you talked. What did you do to Naruto? Why are you really here?"</P><P>Itachi and Kisame looked at each other. Itachi was the first to speak. "If you'll let us explain, we will tell you because now it concerns you. But first we must find and capture Naruto. I don't care if you trust me or not, but you will listen to me when I say now the entire world is at stake, and that boy is its only savior."</P><P><B>A/N:</B> <B>I put more detail into some parts that needed it and for those who only bother to read ones that are 1k to 2k, here you go. To anyone who would like to point anything out that I may have missed that could be helpful, you know what to do. R&R!</B></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><B>A/N: so far, I hope that you have enjoyed the newly remade versions. At the very least they're longer :) Reviews!</B></P><p style="text-align:center;">The Kyuubi Speaks</P><P>(Moments ago with Naruto)</P><P>Naruto couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that the explosion didn't work as the smoke cleared and a sphere of water had appeared in place of the two ninjas, keeping them from harm. "No!" He exclaimed. <I>How is it that didn't work? I should expect nothing less from an elite ninja. </I>Naruto thought. The sphere blew apart, hitting Sakura and Kakashi and knocking them down. Naruto managed just to dodge the oncoming water and pulled out a kunai, going to help his comrades.</P><P>He tried to run to them but was halted by a wave of crows, all flying around him like a cyclone of black feathers. He looked around for a way out instead he found himself face-to-face with Itachi. Itachi placed his hand on Naruto's forehead and whispered something he didn't catch. But when he did, Itachi's hand began to glow a pale violet. Naruto started to feel drowsy, to lose feeling in his body. His vision began to blur and he could barely stand. He looked up at Itachi. <I>What is he doing to me? I…I can barely move and I feel so tired… </I>He thought. Then he passed out.</P><P>When he awoke, he was on his back lying in some water. He looked around finding himself not in the forest anymore, but a large dank hallway. <I>Where am I? </I>He thought. He stood up and checked his surroundings. The hallway was slightly flooded, the water coming to his ankles. The walls covered in rust and dents. Further down it seemed endless as the darkness just kept going and Naruto could feel something in its depths: an old power, filled with malice and hatred. Seeing that he couldn't do anything just standing, he walked deeper into the shadows.</P><P>As he walked on he could feel an odd sensation that he had been here before. <I>This place seems so familiar to me. Why is that? </I>He kept wandering in, getting closer and closer to the center. After some time passed, he discovered the main chamber: a massive room with an enormous cage at the far end bearing a seal of sorts. He went to inspect it when he felt something stirring inside the cage. He cautiously walked over to the cage bars to get a closer look when he heard a voice, from inside. <B>"Who dares disturb my slumber?" </B>It spoke out.</P><P>Noise could be heard from behind the bars and Naruto jumped at the sudden motion of two giant blood red eyes with slits appearing from the darkness. "What are you?" Naruto asked with hesitation in his voice. <B>"It's you again. I see…" </B>The voice said. Naruto frowned and went forward with wonder. "Where am I? Who are you?" He asked this time with more force in his voice.</P><P>The voice chuckled, <B>"Easy young one. I am known as the Kyuubi, the nine-tailed fox demon. As for where you are, we are in your "mindscape". It's where two minds of separate entities meet." </B></P><P>"My mindscape…so we're inside my head?" Naruto said. <B>"Yes. For many years I have been locked away behind these bars, hoping that the day of my release would come soon. But things don't normally come to pass as such. So I had made safety measures in case something like this happened." </B></P><P>"What do you mean? What safety measures?" He said.</P><P>"<B>Answer me this: have there been times when you use your chakra that it seems too strong or too dark, to you and to others around you? That you can do feats unseen or seem to be impossible for others?" </B>The Kyuubi asked.</P><P>Naruto looked back on some of his fights when such things happened: the fight with Haku after his belief that Sasuke had died, one time in the Forest of Death during the exams, and several other cases that matched. He tried to look farther back but couldn't bring anything up. He looked at the Kyuubi with astonishment as he now knew the demon spoke the truth. "How do you know all this?" He demanded.</P><P>The Kyuubi smiled, showing many sharp teeth and laughed. <B>"I know all of these things because I am sealed within you, young one. You see, when the 4</B><B>th</B><B> Hokage put me away he cut my chakra in half; one of said halves resides deep within you. In order to keep such power intact your chakra has naturally grown to be able to rival the amount sealed away. But in many battles you overuse your strength and begin to go into mine. That is why your power was so great whenever you tapped into the vastness of that chakra. You were using MY power in dire situations. However, I still got the last laugh. Before I was fully sealed away, I used the last of my own chakra to seal the other half with me while I was imprisoned." </B></P><P>"Why did you do that?" Naruto asked. <B>"So that on the day I can be free again, I will still have power to get my revenge on those who stood against me all those years ago. You see, with the seal I placed the unused chakra will grow in quantity, so when I have need of it I will have massive reserves of energy to use as I see fit.</B></P><P>"<B>However taking recent events into account, your earlier fight with the Uchiha boy and his partner, I've had to call you down here to show you the reason why they attacked you."</B></P><P>The eyes moved to the side and Naruto could see in the darkness, a red glowing seal on the far end of the cage. He started walking towards it, stopped, and then looked at the eyes. "How do I know you won't try anything?" He said. The Kyuubi laughed and backed away even further.</P><P>He crept slowly towards the markings all the while keeping an eye on the demon. When he got close enough he inspected it. The seal had several small cracks running through what Naruto thought was the wall. He put his hand to it and to his discovery it was the seal that was really cracked. His eyes widened and he turned to the Kyuubi for confirmation. The red-eyed beast nodded its head. <B>"You see. That seal was put up so I would have my power returned to me upon my release. But because of the Uchiha, that plan has backfired severely. The justu he used, could you tell me what it was?" </B></P><P>Naruto thought about it and threw his hands up in frustration. "No! I can't because I don't know myself. All I can tell is that he put his hand to my forehead and that it started to glow some kind of purple." He admitted.</P><P>The Kyuubi's eyes widened and then were shut for a moment. <B>"'Way of the Cursed Seal'…it's a special and rather cruel justu I have heard of that's been used very rarely. It is a technique used on all kinds of seals. Its effects normally depend on the type of seal it's used on. Since this is one kind that keeps some amount of chakra from the caster, the seal will slowly but surely deteriorate and then…"</B></P><P>Naruto was getting anxious. "So what, you get your chakra back. What then? What happens next?" The Kyuubi bent low towards Naruto so they could see eye-to-eye. Naruto didn't move an inch as the beast face was only a breath away. <B>"It means that you must listen very carefully, young one. Due to the justu that was cast onto the seal, it will continue to break away whenever disturbed by any nearby chakra flows and uses, namely your own and the large amounts of mine within you. A time will come that when the seal breaks, the chakra that has been building up over the years will be unleashed, the power of its unsealing will set me free." </B></P><P>Naruto startled but was cut off by a growl from a big set of teeth near his head. <B>"But that is not the worst of it. The main problem is when that much power is released at one time, it will destroy not only me, but you as well and everything around you. The fallout will be unlike anything you or anyone has ever seen in history. When it happens and with my level of chakra the way it is now the blast will annihilate everything within 22,500 miles; that's almost the entire continent." </B></P><P>Naruto was silent. He looked at the cracked seal, and then looked back at the Kyuubi. "What do we do then?" He asked. <B> "We must find a way to repair the seal. Fortunately, I still have outside resources that tell me everything I need to know about what is happening in the world. There is word that far up north there is something that can aid us in this troubled time: a sword that has the power to break and fix any known seal. We must find this sword, so we can fix the seal and keep both you and me alive." </B></P><P>"Ok we have a way to fix it, but how do we get there without Itachi and Kisame catching us?" Naruto asked. <B>"There is a way: when you tap into my power you usually get much stronger. Now that you know better about where this power comes from, I will be able to let you use more of it for what I have in mind. This time when you do it you will enter a feral state of semi-consciousness where you are focused only on where we need to go. On top of that you will be able to run faster, hit harder and feel less pain than anyone. </B></P><P>"<B>However, when you use this you will revert to your most primal instincts and attack anything and everything in your path and will not recognize friend from foe. Along with that the power will tax you greatly. By the time we are a quarter of the way there you will be tired, I guarantee it. Doing this also puts stress on the cracked seal, but I can dampen the effects and slow down the process. The only question is, with the concern of your friends as well as the world now being in danger, will you risk your life even at the chance of dying, to save others? Now that you know the situation, I won't blame you if you don't do it."</B></P><P>Naruto pictured Sakura and Kakashi and their smiling faces (or at Sakura smiling and Kakashi laughing, 'cause no one ever sees his face). Seeing this and feeling the need to help them at any cost Naruto smiled. "Huh, if that's the case then there's no question. It's high time I got a real mission anyway and saving the world sounds more like my style. Let's get moving!" He said. The Kyuubi wasn't in the least by Naruto's response. <I><B>Of course you would say something like that. Watching you over the years you have become so predictable to me. You're always willing to risk your own life for the sake of other people who hated you, some don't even know you and yet you still don't know when to stop. That may soon end your life someday. </B></I>The Kyuubi thought. The demon smiled and stepped aside allowing Naruto to step out of the cage. <B>"Very well, now we will begin. To use my power to its extent you must first focus on your destination, then you dig very deep and try to use my chakra; it will feel different to yours, more heavy and unstable than you own. Once that's done, your body will act and react to anything in the real world while you keep a steady mind on where we're going from in here. Now let's get started!"</B></P><P>Naruto took a deep breath and tried to use that demon's chakra, going as deep as he could into his own reserves until he found it, it was like wading through a sea of blood, it was so red. He went in deeper and began to see himself change in his mind's eye. His fingernails lengthened into claws and his teeth into fangs. His hair was more wild and the whisker markings on his face more visible. Along with that his eyes had changed from sea-blue to blood red just like the Kyuubi's. When he opened his eyes he checked his reflection in the water on the ground. "Whoa, this power…it's something else." He whispered. He stood and started to flow the Kyuubi's chakra through his entire body. That's when the Naruto on the outside had changed and fled, to find the last hope for the world.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P><B>A/N: I apologize for the wait; thinking up these next few chapters in advance is taxing. I hope everyone likes it and is still with me. </B></P><p style="text-align:center;">Stories are told</P><P>Kakashi, Sakura, Itachi and Kisame were chasing after Naruto's general direction. Waves of tension could be felt from both parties as they called a truce until they caught up with the runaway blond. On the way they saw the destroyed terrain in Naruto's wake: small trees had been ripped free from the ground, boulders crushed to pebbles and dust. <I>Damn! I knew the Kyuubi's power was strong, but this is…</I> Sakura thought. "I don't understand. I've seen Naruto use the demon fox's power. This doesn't seem like his kind of rampage; he's usually more all over the place than one point." Kakashi said. He looked to Itachi for an explanation. "Exactly what did you do to Naruto? Why are you doing this in the first place? Who hired you to get him and for what purpose? I know you said you would explain but I'm a little impatient."</P><P>Itachi stopped, causing everyone to stop. He said nothing as he thought about something. "It might make more sense with a tale of old. The story goes that a long time ago a great swordsman went to a blacksmith, an old man to have him make a sword unlike any other. When he got there the old man refused to make him the sword for he didn't have the materials needed to make it. The old man told the swordsman that in order to make the blade he needed metal not seen on this planet.</P><P>"The swordsman recalled that a star had fallen not two nights ago near the old man's home, so he decided to get it and have the old man make the sword with that. He went for a day and came back with a small meteorite, the same star that fell some time ago.</P><P>"The old man finally agreed to give the sword to the swordsman but told him to wait three days and nights, then come back to claim his prize.</P><P>"Three days and nights passed and the swordsman came to collect. The sword wasn't of traditional make; it was a broadsword with a shining silver blade and a golden handle that seemed to have strange markings.</P><P>"The old man told him what the marks were: special seals that when active, can seal and unseal any type of jutsu; to cut it would break the jutsu, and to stab it would repair it. And once the sword repairs any seal the user of the sword can use the same seal any time, without wasting chakra or the need of hand signs. Simply think of the seal you wish and use the sword."</P><P>"But what happened to the swordsman?" Sakura asked now curious. "The swordsman used it many times in many battles, but one day a thief came and took the sword, killing the swordsman in his sleep for good measure. It's been going all over the world since then. One day a wealthy man up in the Light Country named Goturo bought it off of a merchant who didn't know what he had. He however had heard of the stories and tried to use it to see if there was any truth to it. The sword had worked to an extent, but there seemed to be some sort of problem. What it is, he hasn't said. But apparently, when he heard of Naruto and his amazing feats, he hired us to find him and bring him." Kisame finished.</P><P>"I can follow with the bounty hunter business, but how does Naruto going demonic all over the place and then suddenly running fit in?" Sakura asked.</P><P>"We needed a reason to take him with us in case the idea of him coming with us willingly didn't swing. So I was forced to use the Way of the Cursed Seal technique, a rather old and strange technique that has a different effect on whatever seal it's used on. We had used the knowledge of said justu to use as a trump card. When this justu is used on a seal that is restricting something like the nine-tailed demon fox the seal will slowly but surely break and any disturbances surrounding the seal will only speed up the process. Eventually it will be gone and the beast will have been set free."</P><P>"Damn! Well, it worked as we can see. The question now is how long will it take for us to get to Naruto and then fix this." Kakashi said. "I'm going to bet that since you two had placed the justu on Naruto, the only reason that you would have is because this Goturo is able to fix it, am I right?"</P><P>"You are. Right now the only good thing out of this is that inexplicably, Naruto seems to be headed for the Light Country." Kisame said. The group looked to him as he stared into the trees and nothing else. He turned to the others and smiled. "The reason why is because the way to the Light Country is part land, and mostly water; we can catch him on the way."</P><P>Sakura was ballistic. "And you're telling us this JUST NOW!? Have you been thinking about that the whole time?" She said and started taking swings at him. While Kisame and Sakura were going at it Itachi and Kakashi were contemplating on the newly given information. "That's right, even at his current speed I doubt Naruto can beat us all the way there. But we have to hurry; we can't waste any more time standing here." Kakashi said. Itachi nodded in agreement.</P><P>Kakashi looked over at the two fighting. "Hey, if both of you are going to fight, then fight on the way. We have to move double time to catch up to Naruto before he reaches the water." Sakura and Kisame stopped on the spot, Sakura holding half a tree and Kisame about to take a swing with Samehada. Sakura leered at Kisame. "We'll finish this later, chum-for-brains." Kisame smiled evilly showing off his pearly whites. "I'm looking forward to it." And with that they rushed after Naruto at full speed, Itachi leading and Kakashi backing them. <I>I hope we can get to him in time. If they're right when we get to Goturo we had better be careful. A weapon like that can make anyone a powerful ally…or a very dangerous enemy.</I> He thought and ran faster.</P><P>(With Naruto)</P><P>Naruto was plowing through any and everything in his path. Trees were split in half, rocks were crushed like a boy stepping on an ant, and everything living either ran from him or was blown away by the speed he currently possessed. In the mindscape Naruto kept steadily building chakra ever so slowly, so as not to disturb the seal and end it for the both of them. He looked back at the Kyuubi with irritation on his face. "Hey, how long are we going to keep running like this? The speed boost is fucking amazing but it's really tiring me out just keeping this level of power focused on going in one direction. Are we even going the right way?" He complained.</P><P>The great beast chuckled, "<B>Easy there, young one. It will take some time to reach our first destination. We must first travel for two days until we reach water. At this rate it will still take some time to get halfway. You should be thankful you even have my power right now. It normally takes a week by your standards to get to the water.</B>"</P><P>"What water? I thought we just had to keep going north." He said. Kyuubi nodded its head. "<B>True, however there is only so far that we can go on foot. In order to get to the Light Country and then to this Goturo we, above all else, must cross a large part of the ocean that separates most of the other countries of the world and with the Light Country being one of the farthest up north to reach even with the fastest known ways of travel by human means, we have quite a journey ahead of us.</B>" The demon smiled strangely and an odd gleam shone in the redness of its eyes. "<B>That being said, we may as well enjoy each others' company, seeing as until nightfall you'll be stuck in here with me.</B>"</P><P>Naruto startled and almost broke his concentration on the demon's chakra. "WHAT!? What do you mean I'll be stuck with you until we get there!?" He yelled. Being near someone he didn't like for a while was something, but being stuck with someone who knows almost everything in your life and HELPING them was something he hadn't expected. The Kyuubi shifted its arms and laid its massive head on them, eyes still on Naruto. "<B>In order to keep this power contained properly there has to be something to channel it through your body safely and effectively, and since I'm in here,</B>" It said motioning the cage with its eyes. "<B>I can't do anything to help. The thing of it is that you have a base of raw power and if there is nothing to control it…in any case, you must remain here until we arrive. When the sun sets on this day I will take back control and hold back the seal's power for a bit while you rest, to slow its effects.</B>"</P><P>Naruto went back to "channeling" the demon's power. "I know that, I just wish I could help the others more. That I could do something other than lead them to some random place and hope they can follow. I never wanted anyone of my friends to be hurt or in danger after all that they have done for me and now, now nearly the whole freaking world is in trouble. I wish… " He said with a troubled look.The Kyuubi noticed the pain on Naruto's faceand stared at it for a while. <I><B>All of this emotion is something I never understood. It was never necessary for me, a tailed beast of power to learn or understand the ways of the human world, save for how to blend in.</B></I> The Kyuubi thought. The fox started to slowly creep up to Naruto. Naruto was paying too much attention to notice until he turned when he thought it was too quiet.</P><P>He was about to break away from channeling the energy when it stopped just before the cage bars. <B>"Listen and listen well child, I will only say this once: while I do not know or understand your care for your companions, I do acknowledge it. You wish not to bring them harm, for them to be safe and sound? That is not a possibility. You can never keep someone from danger forever. However, what you can do for them is lessen the blow by dealing with this problem laid out before you and the world. I am not accustomed to doing this, but come sundown and only if you want to, I shall aid you and bestow onto you an ancient technique long since used in this time and age.</B>"</P><P>Naruto was speechless before the demon's statement. <I>A gigantic monster stands before me and its willing to help…the odds on this one happening, ah it hurts my head trying to wrap around it.</I> He thought. The Kyuubi growled and turned away. "<B>Don't get the wrong idea. I'm only doing this to increase the chance of my survival. The stronger you are, the better our chances are of getting to this man and his sword. I may have to live in this cage for the rest of your life but I will be alive. That is all that matters.</B>"</P><P>Naruto pondered this for a moment considering the boost in strength and power he had now obtained was helpful so far, it made things interesting to see what else the Kyuubi knew. "Alright, I'll do it! Any kind of help you're willing to give, I'll take." The Kyuubi closed its eyes and smiled. "<B>I thought you would say that. I'm going to rest for a bit, wake me when dusk approaches.</B>" Naruto started something about when that was and how he was going to be able to tell when that happened, but the Kyuubi was drifting of too quickly to pay attention to him.<I><B> You have grown much and surpassed many who wished to stand in your way, no matter what it was or who it is you have always done your best and never backed down from the thought of pain or death if it was to save someone who was precious to you…hmm, I guess this is the emotion humans call pride.</B></I> The Kyuubi thought. Then the beast smirked. <I><B>Of course, half of the troubles this boy had gotten out of were thanks to my power. So it shouldn't be surprising to say that he has gotten stronger. The question is, is he strong enough to learn from the likes of me?</B></I></P><P>(Five hours and twenty minutes later)</P><P>Near the point of sunset Naruto continued running through various dips and rises of the landscape until a full blown canyon surrounded his sights. Giant figures of rock and stone were jutting out from the ground in all sorts of forms. By this time he had been released by the demon's hold to save what energy he had left. But Naruto wasn't paying attention to the area, or that he had been freed; after hours of almost nonstop running the only thing he was focused on was his stomach.</P><P>"Ah, so hungry…and so far there hasn't been anything around that I can eat." He said bent over holding his growling belly. The Kyuubi growled. "<I><B>Quit your whining! It's almost sundown.</B></I><I><B>You should find a place to rest safely until morning</B></I>"<B>.</B></P><P>A few minutes of searching lead Naruto to the discovery of a large cave with some small brushwork near the entrance. He went inside to inspect it and found nothing out of the ordinary. "This place should fine for now." He said to himself. "<I>Alright, now what do I do?" </I>He thought. "<I><B>Sit in meditation. I will summon you to me.</B></I>" The Kyuubi replied.</P><P>Naruto did as he was told, going over to one side of the cave and sat cross-legged and placing his palms on his knees. "<I><B>Now close your eyes and concentrate on my voice…</B></I>" He closed his eyes and listened carefully. Within moments he was back in the mindscape with the demon fox again. The beast smiled mischievously. "<B>Welcome back, young one.</B>" It said. Naruto frowned, "You know very well why I'm here. So let's get started." The smile grew wider.</P><P>"<B>Very well, mind you that this will take up much time and focus on your part. It will tax you of your strength and take you to the edge of your abilities. You will undergo many changes on this trip using the knowledge from me, and once we are done with your training one thing will be clear to both of us: if you are able to fully contain and use the power with me, and the power within yourself. You will learn how to feel the movements of many things around you, see what cannot be seen, act and react to any kind of threat and stop it cold. Among all these things, if you can handle them, you will be able to learn the teachings of the demon world. All of our studies, powers, and uses will be at your disposal. You are lucky to have someone like me around in this troubling time, so be grateful that I am doing any of this at all. Are you prepared?</B>" Naruto simply nodded and readied himself for whatever was coming.</P><P>(In another cave somewhere)</P><P>A bedridden figure was pouring over an open scroll by candlelight when something in the shadows, approaching the person. The man came close and whispered something in the other's ear. The person holding the scroll put it down and smiled. "So, it's finally reappeared again, has it? I believe it's time to get moving, don't you, Sasake?" Another person came to the bedside, a man with a sword to his back and eerie eyes; red eyes with three commas rotating. He bowed in respect. "Yes, Master."</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P><B>A/N: Reviews! Also I have remade the other crappy chapters. Enjoy.</B></P><p style="text-align:center;">Training Troubles</P><P>"<B>We are about to begin your training. Are you ready?</B>" The Kyuubi said. Naruto simply nodded his head and readied himself for whatever was coming. "<B>First, we will work on something you already know: your Shadow Clone technique. You know by channeling your chakra properly and, through hand signs you can make realistic clones of yourself. But what you don't know is that you can take it further, simply by using those clones. I will show you how this is done.</B>" Naruto's eyebrow was raised a little and he crossed his arms. "Don't you need hands to make hand signs?" He asked skeptically. The beast smirked at the comment. "<B>Yes, indeed you do. Come closer and I will show you something fun.</B>"</P><P>Naruto walked towards the cage bars as the Kyuubi closed its eyes and dark smoke started to appear, covering the entire area. The smoke startled him and slowed his approach but he kept coming. He went through the bars, peering through the smoke and noticed a figure at the center. When all was visible again, Naruto saw the Kyuubi had vanished and in its place was a person: a beautiful woman with flowing red hair ending at her waist. She had the face of an angel and the eyes of the demon Kyuubi itself. She wore a blood-red kimono, covering a voluptuous body and only slightly revealing an incredible bust. She would have appeared normal to anyone, except she had red eyes, pointy fox ears sticking out of the top of her head and a long red tail coming out of her back. Naruto started at her for a few moments then she smiled, revealing her fangs. When she spoke she sounded like a human. "What's the matter, fox got your tongue?" She said.</P><P>Naruto shook himself out of his stupor and slightly blushed. "It's nothing…I just didn't think demons could take on human forms." He looked away when he said it. She looked at him oddly, and then shrugged. "Back when I wanted to be entertained, I would visit the human world in disguise. But of course you wouldn't know that. The humans, they normally run at the very sight of me."</P><P>He walked over to her, inspecting her new form. When he was done he looked her square in the face. "So, what do I call you now?" He asked. She was taken aback by the question, a surprised look on her face. "What do you mean by that?" She replied. Naruto placed his arms behind his head. "Well, you are going to teach me new skills, right? Normally sensei would be the right title, but that is given to people who you respect and are your superiors, like a teacher to a student. I just met you and I barely know you. Besides, I can't just keep calling you Kyuubi over and over. "</P><P>She crossed her arms and thought deeply. Her eyes were closed for some time when she snapped her fingers in enlightenment. "What about Yunika? Yunika…Kitsune. Yea, that's it! Yunika Kitsune, I like it." She said. Naruto put his arms down and stared at her again. "Why that?" He asked. She came close to his face and said softly, "What's the matter? You don't like it?" Naruto leaned back a few inches and give her a wary eye. "I thought it sounded cute. Yunika sounds a lot like "unique", and Kitsune does mean "fox"…so it makes sense." Yunika said, sticking her tongue out at Naruto. <I>Unique, huh…she's more like a little kid when she's in this form.</I> Naruto thought.</P><P>He sat cross-legged and rested his hands on his knees. "Alright, so what's first?" He said. Yunika got a serious look on her face and approached him slowly, almost seductively. "First off, you will learn how to utilize the power of your clones. Yes, you can make many clones thanks to my power, and with your quick thinking they prove useful, but you have only scratched the surface of the full potential of them."</P><P>She did some hand signs and two clones appeared beside her. "As you know, Shadow Clones have about one-tenth of your normal chakra, so they can't do much other than be used as decoys and the like. However, there was a time when they were used even more efficiently."</P><P>Naruto was skeptic as Yunika made another hand sign and started to concentrate. Naruto's eyes widened when he saw red chakra come out of the clones and flow into her body. The chakra flow stopped and the clones vanished. Yunika smiled, placing her hands on her hips. "It's a simple technique that allows you to summon your chakra back to you after using the clones. It's nothing special though; the main use was to get your strength back before dispelling the justu."</P><P>"Alright, and this was the technique that you wanted to teach me? All it does is give you back your chakra. It seems pretty useless to me." Naruto said.</P><P>"Of course not, this is one of the many justu I know that will help both of us. Consider it part of your training. I am correct to assume that you have done the tree-climbing and walk-on-water exercises?" Yunika asked. Naruto nodded. "Then you should know the basic principles on the subject of chakra, on how to control and maintain the flow of chakra. Think of it as when you were training to use sage mode, but with one difference: while preparing to use sage mode you must first slowly collect a steady amount of chakra from the environment. With this justu, you will have to focus on where you want to gather the chakra from.</P><P>"But you must be precise; you don't want to try this on a living person you know and lose control on how much chakra you take. The one thing that makes this justu different to your sage mode is you have a limit to how much you can take from a living source of chakra. That's why we are going to start with your clones: they are expendable and you'll have your strength back when you master it. I'll explain later, but for now this will be what you must put your focus on the most while we are alone. You'll just have to trust me." She finished.</P><P>Naruto stood and called, <B>"Shadow Clone Justu!"</B> and two clones appeared. He placed his hands together for the focal point of his chakra to concentrate and closed his eyes. "Ok, since this will be slightly different to how I trained with sage mode, what do I want to do…?" Naruto whispered. He could hear Yunika's voice in his head. <I>"First you must imagine yourself tied to your clones and try to see the chakra link that is made between you and the clones. A chakra link is when two minds are connected by a justu of sorts. We too, have a chakra link which allows us to talk to one another. It's also how you've been able to utilize my chakra in dire times. In theory, you should be able to do the same thing with your clones."</I> She said.</P><P>He focused on his clones and saw them in his mind's eye. He pictured his chakra connecting the clones and him together in an invisible link and then he pictured himself trying to draw the flow of chakra towards him. He kept at it for a few minutes and then stopped when nothing happened and the clones disappeared. "Why did they vanish?" He asked. "When all of the chakra is sucked out of the clones they will naturally go away. The process works like trying to catch the ocean tide with your hands. When you try pulling the chakra out it won't just come to you, it goes everywhere. It's up to you to be able to gather the chakra under your control and bring it to your body." She answered.</P><P>"You won't get it on the first try." Yunika said. Naruto frowned. "I figured that. This is going to take some getting used to." He said. <I>Not much else to do except keep going at it.</I> He thought. He tried again, this time with more attention to the clones. Yunika smirked and turned to the cracked seal. She walked over to it and placed her hands on it and started to rum her chakra through her arms, into the seal, trying to use what power she had to slow the effects of the justu. <I>At least one of us should have some progress by the morning.</I> She thought.</P><P>Hours had passed since the training began and Naruto was exhausted. He was covered in sweat and his chakra was nearly tapped. His breathing was weak and his eyes drooped with fatigue. "I'm…going to…get this…justu down any moment." He gasped. Yunika laughed. "You may think that, but look at you! You're about to keel over, and you've only been at this for seven hours. If you don't stop and rest, soon I'll start to feel the effects." She said.</P><P>Naruto's arms fell to his sides and he dropped to his knees. "Can't stop…have to get this…justu mastered…or else…" He started as his eyes closed and he collapsed, his body falling to the floor.</P><P>Yunika sighed and went to Naruto. "See, I told you." She inspected his body. <I>You always did take things too far when it came to training. It's understandable though, with the entire world at stake, not to mention my life. Still…I have to admit, he has determination.</I> She thought. She turned him over to check his face and an odd look spread across hers. Naruto had on his forehead a strange symbol: a simple diamond inside a circle. <I>Hmm…what's with this mark? That wasn't there before.</I> Yunika thought.</P><P>She went to touch it but it started to fade away. <I>Well, no skin off my bones if it's gone. But it seems strange…</I> She stood and walked back to the seal. Hearing the snores of a good night's sleep coming from Naruto, she shook her head and shrugged. <I>At least he's resting. Anymore training and then he would start tapping into my chakra, and considering the situation…but I wonder what that mark was about. </I>She thought. <I>Oh well, at least we've begun. Let's see how long it takes for him to wish he'd never been born. </I>Yunika smiled as she placed her hands back on the seal, dark thoughts beginning to brew in her mind.</P><P>(Eight hours and thirty-two minutes later, with Kakashi's group)</P><P>The four were resting nearby a cave across from a stream as the morning's light just started to shine over the cliffs that hung overhead. Kakashi and Kisame were keeping watch over their comrades in the branches of a tree as they were sleeping, weapons at the ready just in case if the need to fight arose.</P><P>The two were silent as the leaves blew across the land. Kakashi was ever wary when it came to being cautious, but tonight something had been nagging at the back of his head. He looked over at Kisame and spoke his mind. "There's something you guys haven't told us, isn't there?" He asked. Kisame smiled, his teeth gleaming in the early morning light. "What makes you say that? We've told you all you've asked of us." He replied.</P><P>Kakashi bowed his head. "Okay then, tell me this: this Goturo, how is it he knows about Naruto's condition? Not many people know that he has the nine-tailed fox spirit sealed within him. Also, why hire S-rank criminals as bounty hunters? Goturo has no doubt heard of you two so you can't really expect to get paid. On top of that, how is it that he knew about what was wrong with the seal placed on Naruto?" He pressed.</P><P>Kisame's smile grew wider and he started to chuckle. "I'm not entirely sure. But I have to admit, I didn't think he'd be right on the money about you."</P><P>Kakashi's eye narrowed at the comment. "What does that mean?" Kisame turned to him. "Itachi asked the same thing about it to Goturo and he simply replied, "I know because I need to know. No doubt this Kakashi will ask the same question and if he does, tell him that I am the only solution to this predicament that has been laid out, and that he will need to hurry if he has any hope of meeting the time limit." Those were his exact words." He said.</P><P><I>It seems like this man is hiding something besides a powerful weapon. The question is what is it?</I> Kakashi thought.</P><P>"I don't fully understand this guy's motives either; all I care about right now is that we're doing a job and getting paid for it. What happens on the way happens and there's not much we can do about it, unless of course it's part of the job." Kisame said.</P><P>"What about your main objective? What about getting the Kyuubi from Naruto? Doesn't this job get in the way of that?" Kakashi asked. Kisame lowered his head. "Itachi and I have decided to wait until this whole ordeal is over. What's the point in getting one of the most powerful beings this world has ever seen if the world is going to be destroyed anyway?"</P><P>Kakashi laughed. "Isn't that noble of you to wait until after the world is saved, only to try and capture the beast." Kisame laughed in return. "It is, isn't it?" The two laughed quietly for a time. Kakashi stood up and stretched. "Well, I believe it's time to get moving. Wouldn't you agree?" He said. "That suits me just fine." He replied. He dropped down and went to Itachi. Kakashi nudged Sakura awake and helped her to her feet. "Are you ready?" He asked her. She rubbed at her eyes and nodded. He looked over at Itachi for a response. He too, nodded in reply. Then the group started running after Naruto with earnest, hoping to catch up with all haste.</P><P>Kakashi had been running things through his mind about what Kisame said, trying to find some loophole, something that didn't fit. So far, everything seemed fine. But other things were troubling him now, and it was nowhere near pleasant.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">The First Hunt</p><p>When Naruto awoke he was back in the outside world. He prodded around in his head for signs of Yunika and found her essence next what he believed to be the cracked seal within the cage. <i>She must be sleeping to save what strength she has left for later.</i> He thought. He stepped outside and stretched his limbs in the morning sun and climbed up the wall just on the side of the cave to get a better grasp of where they were.</p><p>Over the great distance the landscape showed nothing but more large rock formations jutting out of the ground in which there were dozens of craggy areas surrounding the many protrusions. <i>Jeez, I really hope the landscape changes soon.</i> He thought. His stomach rumbled like a mini earthquake in his body. He held his gut and groaned in hunger. "Oh man, I haven't eaten since yesterday. I'm starving!" He said.</p><p>He sat once again in meditation and prepared to gather chakra from the environment for sage mode. <i>I figure that if I can feel out anything with life, it might be edible.</i> He thought. Just as he began to collect the energy, Yunika yelled throughout his mind. "<i>Wait! Don't you remember what I said about using your chakra in ways that could increase the strain on the cracked seal?! Attempting to use sage mode is one such danger because of the amount of outside chakra you have to obtain would speed up the process and we need all the time we can get.</i>" She said.</p><p>Naruto jumped at the sudden verbal assault. "Sheesh, I thought you were sleeping. I didn't think that trying to collect chakra would be such a risk. But you can't exactly blame me; using chakra is second-nature to all ninja." He said.</p><p>Yunika growled. "<i>Well think next time before you use your chakra! Any kind other than your natural chakra and my own chakra would enhance the damage done already, so you must be careful. What were you trying to achieve anyway?</i>" "I was hoping I could find something to eat and the best way that I can do that is to sense around the area with sage mode for food." Naruto explained.</p><p>Yunika mumbled for a bit and sighed. "<i>If that's all then consider it a problem solved. When I call you down to my cage, do you know how I do it?</i>" Naruto folded his arms in agitation and grumbled a no. She snickered, "<i>It doesn't surprise me. It works on the principle of chakra links. When two or more entities are connected or summoned by means of a justu it creates a chakra link, an invisible connection that only those who were used in said justu can sense. Your clones, and how we are talking to each other at the moment, are a form of a chakra link.</i>" She explained.</p><p>"Okay, I get that part. So give me the short story on how to bring you to me." Naruto said. "<i>You must search out my essence and try to summon it to you with your chakra and will. Once you have, you and I will share a mind together. Your body and skills will be united with my instincts and knowledge for use of many things; in this case I will teach you how to use the animal senses that will follow with the combination. </i></p><p>"<i>The differences from sage mode and your normal five senses to this are while in sage mode you can feel out for the many chakras of living things and your normal senses are merely human, while when we are combined you will be able to hear the heartbeats and determine the position of your enemy. You should be able to see the blood of anything living or dead and track it down with my eyes. With these skills you talents will be keener than normal, more importantly this will help teach you how to zone in on the target you want to use the technique on.</i>"</p><p><i>I'd hate to hear the long version…</i>"What's the name of this old justu anyway?" Naruto asked. Nothing was said for a minute and then Naruto discovered something hilarious. "You, you don't remember?" He said and when silence was his answer he started to laugh. If he could see Yunika's face he would see her scowling at him. "<i>Of course I haven't! It's just been so long that anyone has spoken to me about it and besides, it was named in a different language that can't be said in your tongue. However now that it comes to mind, I remember it does translate into "Kyuuketsuki Hankestu," which means "Vampire Judgement" because of the principles it works on and how it affects both caster and victim.</i>"</p><p>Naruto began to look worried. "What does that mean? What's going to happen to me if I use it?" He asked. "<i>Hmm, that's hard to say. It hasn't been used in so long I can't even guess at what could happen. The only way to know is to for you to find out." </i>She said.</p><p>Naruto sighed. "Alright, let's give it a whirl." He closed his eyes and concentrated on Yunika's presence and attempted to draw it into his consciousness. He felt her out again just like before and without noticing, something clicked and in an instant he and Yunika were of the same mind and thought. Naruto could hear Yunika's voice more loudly and clearly than before. "<i>Very good and on the first try too. Still you'll need to be able to do better in the future. Now first off, go and find a pond. No arguments, just do it.</i>" She said.</p><p>Naruto leaped from pillar to pillar while keeping an eye on any reflective surfaces on the ground. In the corner of his eye he saw a good sized watering hole under a massive overhanging cavern. He raised an eyebrow. <i>That should work.</i> He thought.</p><p>He stopped at the water's edge and leaned over to see his image. His face went from interest to shock. Like before when he dove into Yunika's power his appearance had changed. However this time he saw new characteristics added. His hair was a few inches longer and lighter in color, a pale yellow. His ears were slightly pointed and the whisker marks looked as though they had begun to fade away.</p><p>It wasn't just that; when he stood up he saw himself taller than he remembered and strangely, more muscularly. "Whoa, what did you do to my body?" He said inspecting his newly acquired features. "<i>When you and I are as one in this state, some of my features will be meshed in with some of yours, such as the eyes, teeth and hands. It doesn't matter whether you are in my prison with me or you call me in your head. </i></p><p>"<i>Like this I can see what you see and hear what you hear, I can even grant you better focus when we're like this. But the ears and the hair I can't explain. It's possible it could be a side effect of your training with the justu. I did say that it transforms the body of the caster. What amazes me is how fast it works or that you didn't notice until now. That's why I wanted to see what your reaction would be like when you actually saw yourself like this. Well? What do you think?"</i></p><p>Naruto stood up to examine himself further. "I look a little, what's the right word, unworldly? How long do the effects last?" He asked. "<i>I don't know if they do. This is the first time I've seen someone use the technique before. I have to say I find it fascinating.</i> <i>Now close your eyes.</i>"</p><p>Naruto did as he was told. Thanks to his ninja training he immediately became tuned into the sounds surrounding him: the slow steady drip of water falling from the stalactites on the lip of the cave, wind blowing through the rock crevasses, the heartbeats of animals out and about for their morning breakfast. "<i>Okay, now what? I can already do this with ease.</i>" He said, now in thought-speak. Yunika snapped at him. "<i>Fool! Pay close attention and you might learn something.</i>"</p><p>Naruto winced in pain as he felt an overpowering surge of something invade his thoughts. When it finally stopped he could think straight again. "Hey what the hell was that?! What are you trying to do, implode my brain?!" He shouted.</p><p>"<i>Take it easy! If you're done yelling at me take a look around you.</i>" He opened his eyes and gasped. The area had changed before his eyes. The structure of it all was still the same, but there was a noticeable difference.</p><p>The land was aglow with faint, wavering phantom lights, parts of which were different colors. The earth was alive with a reddish-brown. Nearby plant life had a hazy green. Others swarmed the area and mixed in with the lights. "Wow, this is…what am I seeing?" Naruto asked in awe. "<i>Remember carefully, I did say that I can give you a boost. The pain you felt was me fully assimilating with your mind and will lessen each time it happens. You are now seeing through my eyes. My vision is more advanced than humans so I can see things they can't. What you're observing now is the soul essence of everything around you. Not chakra, the actual pure life aura of the planet. Plants, animals, humans, they all have a kind of resonating energy that you can see with my sight. Try listening for anything nearby again.</i>"</p><p>Naruto, once again listening to the environment, heard things more distinctively. He could clock the buzzing noise from an insect eleven feet from the far left and tell where the rhythm of the heartbeat of a snake that was seven yards directly behind him. "It's like having Hinata's Byakugan for my ears. Let me guess, acute instinctive hearing?"</p><p>"<i>You're getting better. Now for your first test, using these new tricks I want you to hunt down your meal and kill it. No weapons or justu allowed, only your skills. I'm also adding a special handicap of sorts: when our minds are united you will communicate with me only by thought. It will be good for you to get used to this for stealth missions in the future.</i>"</p><p>"<i>Okay! I can do this no problem. But where do I start?" </i> Naruto thought to her.</p><p>Yunika sighed. <i>"You can start by paying attention to the flow of energy as it shimmers across the sky. The more mobile ones are usually animals, the bigger the better. Happy hunting."</i> Naruto could hear the smugness in her voice. <i>I can tell she's going to enjoy this a bit more than she should.</i> He thought to himself.</p><p>And so with a half hour of practice under his belt Naruto prepared for his first catch. He found a large green lizard whose head was the size of his entire body, on a boulder resting in the sun. He cracked his knuckles and flexed his hands-turned-claws, slowly raking them against the hard ground to check their sharpness. He smiled a toothy smile and chuckled. <i>It's time to test these bad boys out!</i> He thought and pounced.</p><p>Now, right at this moment something had happened. Maybe it was Naruto's scent or the creature wasn't really asleep. Whatever the case the lizard's eyes opened, turned its head upward, and swatted him away with its tail. Naruto bounced off a stone wall and landed in heap. He rubbed his head and stood up. <i>That was just perfect. I just got my ass handed to me by a reptile.</i> He thought. Yunika was laughing hysterically. <i>"Shut it! You watch I'll get that damn thing yet."</i> He thought at her.</p><p>He retaliated with a yell and rushed at the beast's face, aiming an uppercut for the jaw. The blow connected and the lizard's head jerked back from the impact. It roared in anger and tried eating him. Its maw snapped over and over again only to get dust in Naruto's wake as he dashed to avoid it. Getting aggravated, Naruto launched wild swings along its back, one after another with no avail.</p><p>"<i>Nothing is working so far. Got any ideas?"</i> Naruto thought. <i>"Try severing the tendons in the back of its legs. If anything it should slow the beast down some." </i>She replied. He kept suppressing the urge to take out his kunai and skin this thing alive and using his justu to beat it to death but he knew he would fail the test if he did.</p><p>Naruto leaped behind the lizard and ran for its legs while keeping the creature's tail in sight. He swiped at the area just below the back of the knees, luckily drawing blood from all four. The lizard shrieked again this time out of pain and collapsed with its head just missing Naruto as he rolled away.</p><p>"<i>Now that we have a minute to talk, time for a quiz: what parts of most lizards are edible?"</i> Yunika questioned. <i>"I don't have a clue. You mind giving me a hint?"</i> He answered sarcastically. She had begun to get irritated. <i>"Again, that doesn't surprise me. The tail! Take off the lizard's tail. Some species can detach them in order to get away from their attackers. It can survive without it."</i> She explained. Naruto made for the tip and grabbed on to it, dug in his claws and pulled with all his strength.</p><p>The creature thrashed about and Naruto struggled with the amount of force it was using as he attempted to yank off the thing's tail. The tail rose and started flinging Naruto around trying to get rid of him. Naruto was enraged at this point and shouted at the beast, "Damn it! All I want is your tail, you stupid giant mutant gecko!" Yunika snickered. <i>"You know if something like this is too hard for you, you can always stop. But if you can't win against a mindless thing such as this, you have no chance at saving yourself or your friends."</i></p><p>That really set him off. "I'll show you!" He screamed and let go as the beast's tail went up and threw Naruto sky-bound. When he reached the zenith of his flight he readied his right hand. As he fell he positioned his body to pick up speed fast and aimed for the tail base and just as he neared it he brought his hand down and cleaved it off.</p><p>The lizard bellowed one last time before it finally passed out. Naruto was panting from exertion. <i>"Ha! I told you I could do it. So, did I pass?"</i> He thought with a smirk and Yunika pulled out of his mind.</p><p>"<i>Hmm, you could have done better but you managed well enough.</i> <i>You got some food so I'd say not bad, but you need to learn to keep your emotions under control in intense situations. Part of this was about you being put in a dire position where you couldn't use your normal techniques or tactics to fight, only your ninja skills and my animal instincts. What if this was an actual fight with someone like a skilled ninja and you didn't have any chakra or kunai? You would have lost in a matter of seconds. That's why because of our predicament you must learn to utilize all of our best traits to increase our chances of survival."</i> She said.</p><p>Naruto frowned. "My, my, aren't you a hard one to please? Well, I say let's cook this baby up and chow down." A half hour went away as he found a large flat surface and cleaned it off as best as he could to cook the tail and another half hour passed by as Naruto collected anything burnable and surrounded the tail with dead plants and some fire-starting materials from his back pouch. Then Yunika instructed him on some plants that could be used as spices to give the meat flavor that could be found in the area.</p><p>While the meat cooked Naruto asked, "Once we're finished eating and I have my energy back, when do we start working on our minds coming together?" <i>"As soon as possible, we need to make up for lost time. You still need to work on the other justu before you start trying anything else. For a start if you are going to continue fighting the way you do now, you'll need a new set of clothes, especially if your changes keep up while using the Vampire Judgement technique. Yours are pretty wrecked. There is a town not too far off course from our destination. We can go and get a new wardrobe there."</i> Naruto looked at his clothing and saw it was cut up in some places.</p><p>"<i>Another thing is the chakra link we have that merges our thoughts. Something like that takes a lot of stamina from both of us in order to maintain it. That's why you were so tired after all of the fighting stopped. We will experiment with it later so we can get a proper time estimate but for now we'll wait."</i> She finished.</p><p>The sounds of the crackling fire filled the air as Naruto twiddled his thumbs. A thought occurred and he asked, "So, you used to visit the human world? What was it like back then and from where did you come from?" He heard nothing from her for a minute and was about to ask another question when she answered. "<i>Back then it wasn't so different from these times. People fought to bring peace and died for the cause. It's one thing that will never change in this war-ridden world. There's always a reason to fight, no matter how ridiculous it is. That's just how all humans are. As for where I came from, I don't remember. My past is a mystery to me of what I was before I was what I am today. Why do you want to know?"</i></p><p>Naruto shrugged. "I guess because you and me are going to be like this for a while now I figured that we should get to know each other. It can't hurt to open up to someone every now and then, can it?" He questioned. Yunika chuckled harshly. <i>"If only you knew. The carriers before you have always wanted to keep me in chains because they feared my power and my anger towards them. When I was transferred into you I had had enough, so that was when I decided to use the chakra seal on myself so I would be ready to take my revenge on the world. Tell me, are you so sure that me opening up doesn't hurt? Because my memories will always hurt when I look back at what they did to me and nothing can change my mind about that fact."</i></p><p>For a single moment Naruto could sense what lied in Yunika's heart: an alien sense of hidden ill temperament, malevolence and mistrust. Then it went away and she closed it off from him. Naruto closed his eyes and remembered what it was like before he had friends. It was a dark and cruel place that he never wanted to return to again, "You know, not everyone is like that. I have seen through your eyes and I have never seen the world look more magical before today. If you've seen my past through my eyes you would see that people can change if they have the chance.</p><p>"One thing I've learned is that revenge is not a path anyone should take, not even if it serves a greater purpose for peace. All you will find is an even darker place than where you are now and you won't be able to get out. I believe there is a touch of goodness in everyone, because even in the deepest darkness there is always a light of hope." He said.</p><p>She said nothing for a while but when she did her only words were, <i>"That might be true and I thank you for the compliment, but you're wrong on one thing. I'm a demon, not a person. Your philosophy doesn't apply to my kind. The tail is probably ready by now. You should eat then get ready to head out."</i></p><p>Naruto shrugged again and checked the meat while Yunika, back in her cage, was in deep thought about the conversation. She was leaning against the back wall next to the seal wrapping her arms around her chest. <i>You were always good with words and I have seen your past, every second of it. But for the life of me I will never be able to understand what you see in changes like that. There is no chance for me to be saved. Not now, not ever. All that matters to me is dealing with this curse as fast as we can, otherwise it will mean the end of all hope, and right now my hope is riding on Naruto getting that blasted sword before he finds out who and what Goturo bastard really is.</i></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">Shadow on Shadow</P><P>(Second day, midmorning, with Kakashi's group)</P><P>The four of them were currently on the move, once again following the path laid out by the rampaging blonde. They had left the forest and were following the trail surrounded grasslands on both sides and torn up areas of dirt and gravel.</P><P>Sakura was getting aggravated and said, "I know you said that we would be able to catch up with Naruto, but explain it to us how that will happen if we keep this course. I mean, he can't really be that far ahead of us, can he?"</P><P>Kisame looked over to her and shook his head in annoyance. "And here I always thought you were the smart one of the group. I'll explain it again, this time with more detail. From his actions that we've seen so far, he appears to be heading north and more importantly, in the direction of the Light Country. With that in mind we can assume that he's actually trying to get to the Light Country and if that's true, he'll need to go over water to get there. The only way to get to it is by boat and there are only three ports up north that make rounds to that place." He said.</P><P>"Since Naruto is still having trouble measuring the amounts of chakra he uses, even at his speed it will take some time to get to the ocean. If you calculate to amount stamina he's using with the amount of rest he would need to recover and stack that against our travel time, even if he manages to get a boat ride the rest of the way we should be on him within three to four days. Naruto may be able to recover quickly but all of that running will still take its toll on him." Kakashi said.</P><P>Sakura sighed. "That much I know already. I'm just worried about that knucklehead and I'm still furious at what you two did to him. I've seen him change before, but nothing compared to this. Between what happened to the village and Sasuke leaving I don't know what I'd do if something bad happened to Naruto in this state."</P><P>Itachi turned his head to her and gave her a blank stare. "None of that will matter if we don't pick up the pace and catch him. All will be for naught if he dies of either overusing his strength or he ends up attacking a nearby village and starting a small war." He said. That said they charged forward as fast as they could.</P><P>(Six hours later, late afternoon)</P><P>The environment changed from breezy fields to craggy valleys as they passed on through areas littered with boulder fragments and body parts of various animals with patches of blood everywhere. <I>Yikes, looks like he really did a number on this place, although it seems more like a </I>monster<I> did all this.</I> Sakura thought. They all paused for a minute to catch their breaths and Kisame inspected the damage done to the bodies.</P><P>He was silent for a time as he went through the carcasses. When he was done he motioned for Itachi to join him. Sakura and Kakashi absentmindedly followed. He pointed to Sakura. "You, pink-haired brat, take a careful look at this corpse and tell me what you see."</P><P>She leered at him. "My name is <I>Sakura</I>, but of course you only pretend to forget just to annoy me." She said. Kisame shrugged. "Have to find something to pass the time. Now use that medical eye of yours to tell me how this creature died."</P><P>She bent down to get a closer look at the dead body of a wolf missing its back left leg, front right leg, left ear and jaw and covered in slash marks. After several minutes she stood up and turned to Kisame. "Do you see it, how this beast really died?" He said. "What do you mean?" Kakashi asked.</P><P>Sakura pointed to the animal. "Notice the missing limbs and jaw, and the other injuries it has. Normally when you lose an arm you lose a large amount of blood with it, but in this case there isn't as much as there should be. Further analyses shows that the long scratch marks on the body may be big, but they aren't deep and inside the wounds there are puncture marks aimed at the heart." She explained.</P><P>Kisame nodded. "I've seen the other bodies and they show the same. First the animals are killed through the perforation to the heart, and then with some strength, ripped apart to give the appearance of an animal attack. All of this was staged by an expert. They used something long and sharp to make the punctures and I don't know what else for the rest of the damage. Whatever did this is intelligent and strong, enough to make all this in an attempt to fool someone." He waved to the wreckage.</P><P>Itachi looked around with caution. "We have to be on our guard. We have to assume that this was a trap set by one or more people or possibly a message meant for someone else. Either way, somebody went through the trouble to make this happen." He said. Sakura looked at him with a brow raised. "Are you sure about all that? True, the way that these were killed is odd but I doubt any sort trap is involved." She said.</P><P>Itachi closed his eyes and bowed his head. "Paranoia has saved many a man." He replied.</P><P>"What I want to know is how fish breath over here could tell what happened." Sakura said throwing a thumb over her shoulder. Kisame smiled with pride. "Just because I smash and dice up everything and everyone I fight, doesn't mean I don't know some things." He said.</P><P>"That aside, I think we've rested enough. Let's get moving." Kakashi ordered and in a flash they were gone. After they left, far behind them in the shadows of a large fissure, four figures slowly appeared and when a few moments passed, gave chase.</P><P>(Two hours and twenty minutes later, dusk)</P><P>A crackling fire kept the oncoming darkness at bay while the group prepared to camp in for the night. Kakashi was resting against a boulder with Sakura beside him eating some provisions. Kisame sat cross-legged with Samehada lying against his shoulder and Itachi was tending to the flames.</P><P>Itachi sat with Kisame and his eyes met with Kakashi's. "So Itachi, there's something that's been troubling my mind for a while. What else can you tell us about the Light Country?" Kakashi asked with an enigmatic glint in his eye.</P><P>"Neither Kisame or myself know much about the history itself, only that it's a somewhat lonesome place that resides high in the north. This much we are sure of. We had never even heard of it until a summons was sent to us." Itachi stated. "You were summoned?" Sakura asked. "Yes. It came in the form of a bright yellow bird with long white plumage with a letter attached to one of its legs. I hadn't seen one of its species before then." Itachi finished.</P><P>Kakashi's eyes widened slightly as Itachi spoke. "I've never seen one myself but I have heard of a bird like that. It's a rare breed, almost extinct in fact. I don't recall the name but they were also called dawn breakers, for their colors. Their home can be found on some of the desolated isles to the northeast." He said.</P><P>"The 3rd Hokage told me about one once when I was a boy and…" He trailed off and sighed as his eyes moved in the direction of some crevices a good distance away from the camp. "Alright you lot, come on out. There's no point in hiding anymore."</P><P>Some movement could be heard, then out of the growing shadows a team of four people came out into the amber evening light. Making up the team there was Shikamaru Nara, Ino Yamanaka, Hinata Hyuga and Rock Lee in their usual attire. Sakura stood up. "What are you all doing here?" She asked. Shikamaru was the first to reply. "The real question should be what are they doing here with you?" He said giving Itachi and Kisame a look as the two prepared for battle. Sakura and Kakashi looked at each other, "I think it's time we exchanged notes." Kakashi said with seriousness in his voice.</P><P>After everyone had settled down, Kakashi explained what had happened so far with them. "…because of the time it takes to move from the Leaf Village to the northern peninsula, we were hoping to catch up to Naruto and see what can be done about his condition. Itachi and Kisame have told us everything they have on this sword and the Light Country, and are currently in a temporary ceasefire with us." He said.</P><P>"Well, that explains why they're not in chains. They play a role in retrieving Naruto and keeping him under if he's still out of control. What does this justu you placed on him specifically do?" Shikamaru asked. Itachi's gaze wavered to Shikamaru. "Ordinarily for what we had prepared for, it would have an effect on his chakra, forcing it to act against his body and cause physical damage to him. Not enough to kill him, just enough to render him incapable of fighting. But I didn't expect for the demon inside him to affect it in such a drastic way and because of this it makes things more difficult in the whole plan of getting him and collecting our bounty." He told him.</P><P>Shikamaru contemplated his words and Kisame finally spoke up. "Alright, we told you our side. How about you tell us yours?" He said. All eyes were on Shikamaru. He sighed and grumbled, "Right then, to start from the beginning I think it's best if Hinata goes first."</P><P>Shyly, Hinata looked down and slowly started. "Well…um…I was out in the forest training, when I heard the sounds of people fighting, so I followed it. When I thought I was close enough I used my Byakugan to see Kakashi-sensei, Sakura and these two together. They talked for a little bit, and then they ran off." She said.</P><P>"It was then that she headed directly for Lady Tsunade to tell her what she found. Afterwards Lady Tsunade sent word for the rest of us to gather and go after you and assist you if necessary, naming me leader of this squad. And it's a good thing too, fortunately I know a little bit about the Light Country." Shikamaru finished. He reached into his backpack and pulled out a map. He opened it up and pointed to the peninsula they were headed for. "As you know, there are ports all around the coast of the land, but very few of them have boats that go to the Light Country. I'll tell you the reason behind that fact.</P><P>"The Light Country was originally called "the Land of Sun," until it under new leadership. More like a small island in the shape of the sun, hence the name change, most people don't know about it so it's not surprising that none of you do. The only reason I know anything about it is because it was part of my studies as a chunin.</P><P>"Now for the important stuff, the island is a small, neutral land that is run by two figureheads and is unknowingly infamous for a prison that is used by every nation, but isn't known to the general public. A special prison that is known only by a few high ranking officials, like the Kages, and people they trust. The prison is exceptional and is purposely made to hold each and every one of its guests, all of them S-rank.</P><P>"The prison is set dead-center of the island with a fifty-meter moat surrounding it and one main river leading to the sea. It's more than a mile and a half tall from top to bottom, two-thirds of which are underwater with five feet of sheer rock making up its structure and six inch metal plating covering it on the inside. On top of that it has a very powerful security system throughout the prison and has a record of zero escaped convicts. All in all, anything that's sent in doesn't come out.</P><P>"The facility acquires funding from not only the lord of the Light Country, but also from those who send the criminals there and everyone who knows about it, call it "the Nine Hells," because it has nine levels each holding more dangerous criminals than the last. Sometimes they'll even send a message to offer aid in the capturing of said villains. As for who takes care of the prison, you should know him as Goturo, the warden of the Nine Hells. He works with the existing ruler of the Light Country to keep the prisoners where they are and runs daily inspections to make sure everything is in order."</P><P>With that said he put the map away and took a deep breath. "That about covers everything I have on the subject. You wouldn't believe how much of a drag it was for me to find the right books on this place." Shikamaru said. "But as far as that goes I don't know a thing about the sword you mentioned earlier. I didn't think broadswords could be found anymore and any that exist now are probably useless."</P><P>Sakura yawned. "Maybe, but it makes me happy knowing what we have to look forward to now. I hate it when I have to do a mission blind. But for now why don't we all get some sleep and you can tell us more in the morning. We have a short enough time limit as it is." Kisame placed Samehada aside and got comfortable. "I second the motion. Blonde has to run out of steam eventually so why not at night." He said. This made the new group give him wary stares.</P><P>He chuckled. "Itachi and I weren't going to pull anything if that's what you're all thinking. The reason behind that as you would put it is because of the most essential part we haven't told you. Due to the technique Itachi used going wrong, we don't know how to approach this safely without hurting your friend. However the real problem lies in Naruto himself."</P><P>Kakashi stepped in. "It's possible that because of what he's going through something neither of us has seen before, we don't know what stress he could be going under to maintain his speed and form, what intense pain he must be feeling right at the moment and even out of all that he is still holding himself back for the sake of his comrades. I can tell that much, but I can't begin to fathom what's happening to him is pleasant. So for your sakes when you see him please try to hold yourselves back."</P><P>Hinata turned her face away while everyone else nodded in conclusion. Just before they all turned in she uttered, "But…just because…it's as you say it is, doesn't mean that there isn't a way to save him from what's happening to him. After all he's done for us, for our village, we owe it to him. And…I'll…I will risk everything and anything I have to help him, no matter what it takes."</P><P>Sakura, Kakashi and her teammates all stared wide eyed at her for the fact stood that she didn't say much. For her to show such fierceness and passion and in front of two S-ranked criminals was truly something rare indeed. Sakura smiled. "Well said Hinata. You're right; we have to do everything we can to bring him back, safe and sound." Her sight turned to Itachi and Kisame. "That goes for you two as well. After all, he <I>is</I> your money card."</P><P>Kisame laughed a genuine laugh. "Don't take this the wrong way, but I'm starting to like you." He said. To his surprise, Sakura actually laughed back. "Amazingly, I don't." She replied.</P><P>Everyone went to sleep with Kakashi being the last one to doze off with the weight of the conversation on his mind as he watched the embers of the fire die out.</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">Tricky Trials</p><p>(One day and a half later, high noon, with Naruto)</p><p>"I get that I needed new clothes but why do I need these ones, and in the middle of summer? The temperature alone will kill me." Naruto inquired. Not too long after the fight with the lizard, Naruto had run into (or through to be more precise) a small group of bandits and the result of the encounter had been more blood on his part as well as most of his standard outfit being ruined. So Yunika convinced him to venture into the town she mentioned before and got a new one, along with a bag and some unusual items she insisted on him getting.</p><p>Naruto was standing in his new getup with a little of his own flare thrown in: a long black leather duster over a black-and-orange shirt bearing the whirlpool mark on his chest, black pants and heavy boots, all of them one-size larger. <i>"Stop complaining! It's because of the changes you're undergoing. So far all that's happened is you grew some inches but who knows what else will happen to you. Now I'd say that's enough talking about that. Let's assimilate and try working on Vampire Judgment again. Over the past three days you've worked hard on it and you've almost got it down but let's try it one more time, this time watch with my eyes." </i>She said.</p><p>He did as instructed and felt the transformation take hold as their minds came together. A slight shock went through his head. "<i>At least you're right about the pain going away."</i> He thought to her as he saw the world's life energy come into focus. "<i>Remember your training. Try to draw out the chakra and seize control of it. Bring it to you and absorb it. You should be able to feel it immediately."</i> She thought to him.</p><p>Naruto summoned two clones and made the hand sign and concentrated. As he did he watched the clones for anything distinctively out of place while the justu was working and his eyes widened with surprise as he saw what he felt happening.</p><p>The clones were transforming. They grew taller and stronger, the ears became pointed, their hair grew longer and paler and the marks on their faces were fading. <i>"So, that's the cause of the other add-ons. I think I now know what's going on with your body kid."</i> Yunika thought. Naruto was too focused to pay attention to her; his gaze on the amounts of chakra flowing through the air.</p><p>Before the chakra could disperse he channeled it through the link the clones had with him and with a slow start he managed to do it and absorb it all. The clones vanished and he jumped around in delight. "Alright, I did it! I did it!" Naruto said with enthusiasm.</p><p>"<i>Yes that's great. Now shut up and get out the mirror and the pocket watch you bought."</i> She thought at him. He cringed at the volume of her thoughts but complied. He searched in the bag and brought out a simple hand mirror the size of a baseball.</p><p>"<i>Now is a good time as any to see how long we can hold this mind assimilation together. First we work on establishing a faster connection, which should help in the middle of battle. Next, if we can estimate a time limit, we can use what we know to work on increasing that time limit. We should be able to tell when the boundaries have nearly been met. Afterwards I want you to watch your reflection until your "other features" disappear." </i></p><p>Naruto held both items at eye level, and kept one eye on the mirror and the other on the watch. It wasn't too long before Naruto started to feel a kind of stress on his body like he had done five days' worth of training and when Yunika began to feel it in her mind she separated from his thoughts and the strain let up. <i>"It looks like we can only stay like that for twenty minutes before the strain becomes too great to bear." </i>Yunika thought.</p><p>His eyes turned back from red to blue, but the changes done to his ears, hair and whisker marks remained. Two hours had come and gone before Naruto fully changed back. <i>Twice as long as the first time…that must mean every time I use this technique, the effects will last longer. </i>He thought.</p><p>Naruto had just placed the items back when out of nowhere he felt a falling sensation and his vision blurred. He closed his eyes for a moment and when he opened them, he was back in the demon's cell. "What do you think you are doing dragging me down here before warning me? If we were in the middle of-" Naruto started and turned silent when he looked upon the face of an oddly pleased Yunika.</p><p>A sly smile was spread on her face with a tiny part of one of her fangs poking out between her lips. A glint in her vermilion eyes told of a mischievous secret that she was hiding. Her arms were crossed under her breasts, unknowingly pushing them up to show extra cleavage. Her tail twitched about playfully and one of her ears was slightly crooked. <i>That's actually kind of…hot. </i>He thought.</p><p>Naruto was taken aback by all this and for his surprise he got a different look that had started to become a daily thing: a look of annoyance. "What's with the stare? Weren't you about to chew me out again or is your mind elsewhere?" Yunika snickered.</p><p>Naruto blinked and grinned back. "Sorry about that. Actually, you're right on both accounts. What was so important you had to bring me down here so fast?" He asked. She chuckled. "It's because, for starters, I know what's happening to your body. When you use the Vampire Judgment technique you undergo a type of physical alteration as you have already seen and I was wondering why that was. I had my suspicions when I saw the changes, but at the time I thought the justu the Uchiha boy placed on you was the cause." She said.</p><p>"That much I figured out on my own. What I want to know is what am I turning into?" Naruto asked. Yunika walked up to him and leaned in. "Then pay close attention to what I'm about to tell you. The technique you're learning, does not originate from human kind and the only reason you can use it is because you have me. " She breathed.</p><p>Naruto stared wide-eyed at her. "Doesn't originate from human kind? Than where does it come from?" He asked. "Isn't it obvious? The justu was created by demons!" Yunika exasperated. Naruto looked down at his hands. "Demons made this technique? How is that possible?" He said. Yunika brought a hand to her face and sighed in frustration. "Did you think that humans were the only ones, who could do such things? It figures, many of us were here before you were and even then we knew all kinds of things. But I'll come to that later.</p><p>"There are many justu in the world and some of them are of demonic origin, however most of them are forbidden for the risks they carry or they can't be used by humans because they're not meant to, not without help from one of our kind at least. The reason why is because normally the human body can't take the stress and it gets torn apart from the inside-out. In special cases like ours, when a human who hosts a demon of any kind tries a demon-style justu, they slowly become what we call Onmyoji."</p><p>Naruto looked at her with a blank stare. "Uh, yea, what are Onmyoji?" He asked. "The Onmyoji, or demon sages, are humans who have our powers, and are able to influence the world around them at will. A human who carries a demonic spirit in them has access to their strengths by working together, but the Onmyoji can take it further. They are able to independently use demonic techniques and when they do their bodies change and adapt to best suit their newly acquired powers. They have many talents, one of which is being able to summon Shikigami, spirits from many plains, to their beck and call. Given enough time and proper training you wouldn't even need my help in using such justu." She explained.</p><p>"That's pretty cool, but it seems like we wouldn't be able to use any of that due to the chakra seal in your cage." Naruto pointed out. "That's true and that's one of the reasons why I'm teaching you this specific justu for that purpose. Vampire Judgment not only allows you to take chakra from your enemies, it can also be used for using other techniques you know on the fly, without disturbing the deteriorating seal if only a little to perform it." She said.</p><p>Naruto looked up at Yunika with a stony face she couldn't read. "I wonder if there's all that to learn, of what else can be done. What else do you know?" He asked with an off tone. Yunika blinked this time. "Look, I know that this is a lot to take in, but you should know that almost everything I have in my bag of tricks can't be used right now. First off, your skill level is still shaky at best with the current justu so trying to learn more would take up too much time, a luxury we can't afford to waste.</p><p>"Second, the level of chakra you have isn't anywhere near the amount needed to use the other, more powerful justu even if we combined both of our useable reserves. Third, both of our chakras can't be used for big stuff, like your Rasengan for instance. The more powerful the justu and the more chakra required using it, the more the seal will crack away." She said.</p><p>Naruto nodded. "Good enough for me, I guess, but what about later? You yourself said what if I ran into a powerful opponent? I'm not going to live very long if I don't have something more special up my sleeve."</p><p>"When and if we can, there are some things that I can teach you. But for now the best thing you can do is work on this justu first. You have passed the first stage which shows you have basic control over your chakra link with your clones. The next stage is to use it on something you don't have a chakra link with, like a wolf or a bunny or the like. To do this you must be in physical contact with the creature, focusing your mind only on that one thing and the rest should follow. The real trick will be to not take so much away that it will die.</p><p>"This will prove more difficult than you realize, because when you use it on something such as an animal, something that naturally doesn't have chakra, you will have to convert its energy into chakra. I leave that one to you to figure out."</p><p>Naruto took a deep breath and exhaled, "Alright. If that's the way it has to work, then I'll work my way through it and master this justu." Yunika laughed. And with a snap of her fingers Naruto was back in the outside world sitting in meditation. He raised his head and looked around.</p><p>The landscape was nothing but grassy valleys in all directions and with the overpowering smell of salt in the air the two knew they weren't that far from the ocean. Naruto was about to start running north when Yunika's voice went off. <i>"I have an idea for a little game to pass the time. A gamble if you will. We have a little over a day's journey to get to the sea if you stretch it out. You have that time to master the second phase. If you do I'll teach you a very useful justu that you will find interesting. How about it hmm, your luck verses the time limit?"</i> She mused.</p><p>Naruto smiled. "Ha, Yunika, you're on. I'll show you that with some guts there's nothing I can't do! Besides, I love a handicap, especially when there's a prize at the end."</p><p>(At that moment, with Kakashi and Shikamaru's)</p><p>The two squads trekked a path across the rocky plains as the afternoon sun pelted them with its rays. Ino groaned in the growing heat. "This is ridiculous! It wasn't this hot earlier." She said. Shikamaru stopped and looked up at the sun with a hand covering his eyes. Kakashi looked over at Shikamaru and the others. "I think it's about time we take a quick break. What about you three?" He said to Sakura, Itachi and Kisame. Itachi's eyes passed Shikamaru with interest and the rest of his team. "I suppose so. Everyone will need their strength for what we have planned." He replied.</p><p>Hinata removed her backpack and took out some metal poles and a large tarp. "I brought along a rain cover, but we can use it here for shade." Lee stooped down and picked a piece. "Very nice Hinata, I will help." He said and went to work. Ino pulled some water bottles and tossed one to Kakashi and within moments their cover was up. Sakura stretched her arms laid down on the ground. "Ah, that's much better. I know it was going to be hot but even I have to agree with Ino. What do you think Kakashi-sensei?" She asked.</p><p>After he took an unnoticeable swig from the canteen and passed it to Kisame, Kakashi stared at Shikamaru with the same look that Itachi was giving him. "Why are you so captivated by the sky today Shikamaru?" He inquired. Ino propped herself up on her elbows and leaned back. She glanced up at the bright blueness and turned her head to Shikamaru. "I know you have a thing with gazing up at the clouds but there aren't any out today." She said.</p><p>Shikamaru barely heard her as his mind drifted away…</p><p>(One day ago, midmorning)</p><p>Everyone had gathered around a map to make their next move. Shikamaru was explaining his analysis of the situation. "Ok, after thinking about what you all know about Naruto's condition, I have some ideas as to how we get him back to normal as well as what we do further down the line.</p><p>"Let's look at the current members in our party for starters. You have a kunoichi with expert medical skills plus flawless chakra control, a jounin who is well-traveled and has more than a handful of techniques, and two S-class criminals made up of an Uchiha prodigy and an adept swordsman who wields a weapon that eats away at chakra. We have two kunoichi, one useful for scouting with Byakugan along with a powerful widespread defense and one useful for recon with the ability to take control of the enemies' minds and gather essential information, a taijustu specialist with high-speed capabilities, and a shirker tactician.</p><p>"Laying our talents on the table I can create a formation that can support these attributes and will prove most effective in our case, since we need speed. We'll be starting in two rows side by side. In the first pair will be Hinata and Kakashi. Hinata, for obvious reasons, will scope out the area and Kakashi can point out the best path we need. In second will be Sakura and Lee. In case of trouble, they will be used to take care of any natural obstacles with Sakura leading the front charge and Lee coming in to finish it, plus it should benefit for the whole of the team if we have the medic in the center if one of our people gets injured.</p><p>"Next up is Itachi and Kisame. Because you two are well known for your abilities, you'll be the assault against most enemies wanting either to steal from us or stand in our way. Last in tow will be me and Ino. My insight on the situation can give us the best idea on what to do next and I can hold off anyone coming at us from behind with my Shadow Possession justu followed by Ino's mind techniques. We will be back up on standby for anything that gets to nasty. In other conditions if someone gets hurt Hinata can see the damage done and Sakura can fix it. Another one would be if we have enemies in waiting ahead of us Ino can take care of them if we're close enough. Other ideas come to mind but the best thing to do is expect the unexpected and try to catch up with Naruto. What we do after that will come to later. " He finished.</p><p>Shikamaru put the map away and yawned. "Well, I'd say you've just thought about everything Shikamaru." Ino said. "That might as well be, but the one thing a good shinobi must always remember is that even in the best thought out plans, something can always go wrong." Itachi said. Kisame snorted. "Yep, I call it the fuck factor. Anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Those, my friend, are words to live and die by." He said.</p><p>Shikamaru yawned again turned his eyes to the skies. The sun was past the point of dawn and the heavens still had a mauve look to them and there wasn't a cloud in sight. <i>Hmm…there's something…</i> He thought. He stood up and brushed himself off. "Okay, how about we get moving? If Kisame is right Naruto will be in our sights soon enough but not if we don't catch him before he grabs a ship and ventures out to sea." No one said anything and they started off.</p><p>(Present time)</p><p>Shikamaru's sights remained on the skies. The area held an eerie tranquility to it that he didn't like. Something was itching at the back of his mind, something that told him they should start moving. Shikamaru! Hey, earth to Shikamaru!" Ino shouted. Shikamaru turned to stare at her. "What is it?" He asked. "We've been asking you what's so damn interesting about the sky, but you were gone for like five minutes." She said.</p><p>"It's something I noticed and it's been bothering me since yesterday. Take a long, careful look at the sky." He said. Everyone stared at the endless azure space. "I do not see anything." Lee said. "And therein lays the truth: nothing. There is an old wives tale about the sky. A clear sky come morning brings good luck. But a clear morning with a violet sunrise means trouble ahead. Ever since dawn of yesterday I haven't seen one single cloud up to now. Along with that I specifically remember the smell of rain on the wind the night before then, yet not a drop has fallen. It may just be me but I think something isn't right." Shikamaru clarified.</p><p>Itachi's eyes moved back to the sky and activated his Sharingan. "The boy's right. A powerful kind of genjustu has been placed over the entirety of the sky. My guess is it's meant to disorientate anyone caught in it and take them off course. It's fascinating; I have never come across one like this before. Give me a minute." Itachi closed his eyes and lowered his head. A minute came and went when he upturned his face and opened his eyes. The sky began to undulate and fade away. When it stopped clouds appeared, drifting on the air.</p><p>"Well there's that taken care of. Hinata, do a scan of the area to see if there is any change." Shikamaru instructed. She switched on her Byakugan and swept the environment and found only one difference. Off in the distance there rested an edifice temple lying in ruins and was the source of Shikamaru's uneasy feelings. "The genjustu appears to have been placed to cover that structure. But of what importance is it?" Lee wondered.</p><p>"Why don't we go and check it out then? I have a feeling that it might be worth the time." Itachi suggested. Kakashi turned his gaze onto the ruins. "I agree with you. Normally I try to avoid things like this, on the other hand when someone goes through that much trouble to disguise a wrecked building and everything around it, which means there's something worth hiding. It also means that it's worth finding." He added.</p><p>So against his better judgment Shikamaru sighed and got to his feet. "I guess so. It is on the way so it wouldn't hurt to see." Nobody said anything as they packed up and made for the odd building with curiosity. Shikamaru still had his doubts about it, questions that couldn't be answered. What was this strange place they were walking to? What was it doing in the middle of nowhere? And most importantly, why was it cloaked from prying eyes? It wouldn't take long for them to find out the reason they were being drawn toward it and their discovery will leave its mark on them to the end of their days.</p><p><b>A/N:</b>I have to do this because I know someone will mention it soon enough: I apologize if my translations are off about the Onmyoji and the Shikigami. If they are please notify me and I will correct them as soon as possible, my skills are still a little rusty. Also I want to acknowledge Memphis for some more thought on the Vampire Judgment and where I could go with this chapter. I know you're reading this so I want to say thanks with that. And Nikoman, please, I know you have some thoughts on this. Give when you can! Anyway story's getting pretty good, I know some of you are thinking that, others are thinking I could use more work on them. That's cool and I respect that; a good story needs different opinions. If you have any you know what to do: FF reviews, DA comments.</p><p>P.S.: If anyone has any good ideas from otherworldly lore from anywhere, please throw that out there and I'll see if I can weave them in. Thank you and enjoy.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">Old Knowledge, New Deals</P><P>(With Kakashi and Shikamaru's group)</P><P>After spotting the ruins, the lot of them crept their way towards it. Kakashi took point with Hinata right alongside her. Lee swiftly went from rock to rock coming in from the far right and Sakura from the far left. Shikamaru and Ino weren't far behind, staying some twenty feet away from Kakashi and Hinata, and Itachi and Kisame we nowhere to be seen.</P><P>If the building was impressive from a distance it was a sight to behold up close. Although the foundation was built close to the ground it was still larger than most. Beyond a short flight of stairs stood four imposing pillars holding the entrance up and above that there were layers of aged rock stacked atop one another high into the sky so high that Kakashi and Hinata had to strain their necks just to see the top. Resting at its peak was a pair of huge bronze hands reaching for the heavens and they appeared, at one time, to hold something in their clutches.</P><P>"What do you suppose this place is, or rather used to be?" Ino asked Shikamaru. He gazed upon the temple with an unnerving look in his eye. "The thing that comes to mind is that it's an abandoned temple from way before our time, but something like that shouldn't be here, surrounded by nothing but a wasteland of stone and of such size. If I am right, then the thing that's been bugging me should be right too." He answered. "What do you mean? Is it really so odd that there's something like this out here?" She said with doubt laced in her voice.</P><P>"If it was on a map than I would have believed it to be an old monument of sorts. Think about it logically, anyone with half the talent that Itachi has would have noticed the genjustu and found this place too. I find it suspicious when we find something like this, and none of us know a thing about it? No, something is definitely wrong." He replied.</P><P>Kakashi placed a hand on his communicator. "Is everyone at their positions?" Shikamaru's voice sounded off. <I>"Just waiting on you two."</I> "Good. Hinata, are you ready?" She nodded and gulped out of nervousness. The duo walked up the steps, entering the ruins.</P><P>There wasn't much to look at. Moderate-sized piles of rubble were scattered about the floor leaving holes in the ceiling to act as skylights. The ground was laid with loose bricks and gave the look like it would collapse even at the slightest application of pressure. At the center stood a large pedestal with the remains of a statue with missing parts no doubt added to the slowly growing debris. At the far end was an archway with a stone tablet, untouched by time and was perhaps the only part of the building that wasn't in shambles.</P><P>"It would appear that Shikamaru was right on the money but the place is so wrecked I can't tell what kind of temple it is. It should be alright for everyone to enter. Follow the plan just in case." Kakashi said through his communicator. <I>"Understood."</I> Shikamaru replied. Kakashi inspected the statue with interest while Hinata studied the walls and ceiling with her Byakugan.</P><P>The two were soon joined with Sakura and Lee, their eyes wide with awe at the sights. "Whoa, seeing all of this at our present time makes me wonder when it was constructed." Lee said, bemused. Sakura patted him on the shoulder. "Come on, you and Gai-sensei must have been all over the map by now. Gawking at ancient ruins like a bumpkin in a big city doesn't seem like you at all." She giggled.</P><P>"I know. I spoke with Shikamaru on our way here and he told me a theory he had, though he didn't say what about. I have a feeling that we will find out shortly. I mean it <I>is</I> Shikamaru." He said.</P><P>"Do you see anything that looks alarming or dangerous, Hinata?" Sakura asked. Hinata shook her head. "Nothing yet, it looks just like an ordinary temple. The foundation is constructed out simple limestone with traces of an element I don't recognize. I'm also detecting something radiating from the stone tablet based at the far-side of the room. I don't know how to explain it, really." She said with an air of anxiety around her.</P><P>Kakashi examined the slab which depicted three carvings: the first on the left stood a man with animals around him, all of them carrying orbs in their mouths and balls of fire floating about. The second on the right showed a powerful looking dragon and two elderly men, one carrying a bag over his shoulder and the other holding a drum with a wolf standing alongside him. In between them was a great bat engulfed in flames with fiery claws reaching up for the sun, covering all in its shadow.</P><P><I>What is this, this sense of unease? Why would something like this be in an old temple?</I> Kakashi thought. "Hey, come and take a look at this." He called to the others. While he, Sakura and Hinata were inspecting the ruined archway and it's tablet, Lee eye's traveled everywhere else from the roof to the pillars and finally over the entrance where he saw a peculiar sight.</P><P>"I believe we may have a problem. We are no longer alone." Lee warned the others and unconsciously put a hand on his weapon pouch. All eyes went to Lee then passed from his to the direction he was looking at. There was an old woman walking in with a cat at her side.</P><P>The room filled with tension in an instant and thick enough to cut with a knife, for how was it that an elderly civilian could enter a guarded building that was mysteriously hidden not too long ago from such skilled ninja, and in the middle of nowhere? Kakashi whispered into his communicator, "Ino, Shikamaru, why aren't you two watching the temple entrance?" <I>"What are you talking about? We are watching it? Why, what's going on?"</I> Ino responded. "There's an old woman and she has a cat with her coming through the entrance."</P><P>Shikamaru edged pasted the rock he was hiding behind for a clearer view. "Where did she come from? She couldn't have gone past us or we would have noticed." He gasped. Ino turned to him. "Should we do something about her?" She inquired. Shikamaru put a hand to his chin in thought. "No. Let's hold off and see how this plays out. If necessary we can always use plan B. Do you hear that Kakashi?"</P><P>"Fine then, understood." Kakashi confirmed.</P><P>The old woman was as ordinary as they came. She donned a light-blue robe with a white sash wrapped around her body from her right shoulder to the left side of her waist. In her right hand she held a knobby cane that looked even older than the temple. The feline was gray with a pure white streak with triangle-shaped markings on each side running down its back.</P><P>Her eyes went from each person, stopping at Kakashi. When she talked her voice was as you would expect coming from an elderly person. "My, my, it's so rare for this place to get visitors. From where do you hail from, if you don't mind my asking?" She said.</P><P>Everyone hesitated; no one was sure what to say. Then Kakashi, first bowing out respect and carefully choosing his words, spoke. "We come from the Hidden Leaf Village born in Konoha. My name Kakashi Hatake and these are my teammates. We are presently on a mission to find our friend. Can you tell me if you have seen anyone pass through here?" He said.</P><P>The old woman smiled. "Oh how nice. Mannerisms are such a rarity to see these days. Not too long ago a young man did in fact come by. He rested for a while and then was on his way. Is it possible that he's the one you seek?" She answered. Their eyes went from one another. <I>We must be catching up!</I> Kakashi thought. "Was the young man that you saw tall and have yellow hair and blue eyes?" He asked. The old woman rubbed her head in thought. "No, not particularly; this one was tall but he had black hair like a raven and carried a sword on his back. His eyes were a strange sight. They were red with markings I couldn't see very clearly."</P><P>Sakura's eyes widened in shock at the description she heard. <I>That sounds like Sasuke! What's he doing in a place like this?</I> "How long was it that he was here? Can you please tell us?" She pleaded. The old woman did nothing but gradually walked passed them. "Before I answer your question, I would like you to hear a tale of sorts. Humor an old woman if you will.</P><P>"There was once a young beautiful girl right around your age young pink haired one. She had a loving family with a mother and a father and a sister, as well as a love of her own: a handsome man, brilliant and talented and brimming with promise. Over time the two lovers grew closer together until their love could not be denied." A sad smile replaced the one before and she stopped in front of the tablet.</P><P>"One day the man asked the girl to marry him. Of course she accepted her heart filled with joy at the thought of being with the one she loved for the rest of her days. Not long after they were married and lived with each other for many years. On one such year the woman's husband fell ill from the unforgiving winter season.</P><P>"Of course the woman did everything she could to help her husband. When the man was on his death bed and the woman had almost lost hope she remembered a story of a hermit that lived nearby and was rumored to have powers that could help her husband. She tended to her lover one last time and then headed out to find the hermit."</P><P>Back outside Shikamaru and Ino could hear every word. <I>Jeez, I hope this story has a point to it. I'm about to fall asleep just hearing it.</I> Shikamaru thought. Ino leaned in to whisper. "I don't get it. She doesn't seem like a threat, so why is everyone so tense?" She asked. Shikamaru gave her a look to keep quiet as he listened in.</P><P>The old woman reached in her robes and pulled out a small pipe and lit it. She took a short drag and continued with her tale. "A day had passed before she found the hermit in a cave with glowing plants hanging from the ceiling. She found the hermit, a man covered from head to toe in rags so she couldn't tell what he looked like, she could barely tell that it was a man because of its voice.</P><P>"'Why have you come here?' The hermit said to the woman. She told him her plight and asked for his help. 'I will make so you can be with your loved one, but you must give me something in return.' The woman said she will give him whatever he so desires that is within her power. 'Take one of the plants that hang from the roof of this cave and boil its leaves for the nectar they possess has the power to cure your husband. But you must hurry; they only have the power to cure while they still glow and once plucked, the glow will fade and the cure will turn to poison and kill your husband.'</P><P>"Without a second thought the woman took one of the luminescent vines and hurried as fast as she could to her husband, all the while keeping an eye on the plant. When she got home fortune smiled on her as she found her husband still alive by some miracle. She did as she was told and gave him the nectar from the boiled down plant.</P><P>"For the moment it looked like the nectar had cured him. He turned healthy and lively and the woman slept peacefully believing everything would be fine. But come morning the woman woke to find that her husband had died in his sleep. She went back to the hermit and demanded an explanation. 'I gave you what you wanted; your loved one was cured. I merely took what was rightfully given. I told you that you would be with your loved one, you did not say for how long your time together should be. Now leave and do not come back or death shall be what you find.'"</P><P>"In a rage she took out a dagger she always carried and took the hermit's life. When she unbound the man she discovered that the hermit wasn't a man at all, but an inhuman creature she couldn't identify. From that day on she was cursed to walk the earth, living out her days miserable and heartbroken."</P><P>"That's horrible, for something like that to happen to someone. It's too cruel." Hinata said. "I can't disagree with you there. The world is a cruel one, where the lives of the innocent, young or old, are nothing more than playthings for the wicked to use as they see fit." The old woman replied. "It's true that bad things sometimes happen to people who don't deserve it." Kakashi's hand went to his left eye as his thoughts went to his fallen comrades.</P><P>The old woman put her pipe away and stared at Kakashi with a look he didn't like. "Yes that's very true. It's also true that people do what they must to survive when necessary." She snapped her fingers and pieces of rubble started flying at them. No one had enough time to react as the rocks piled on and began to compact and solidify, imprisoning them. "What the hell is this!? How are you doing this?" Sakura demanded.</P><P>The old woman laughed maliciously and her mouth opened so wide it threatened to split her head open. "Allow me to finish the story. The woman was cursed alright, cursed to spread her misery and make others suffer as she has suffered, and in her darkness a demon was born; a demon who feeds on those who are unfortunate enough to cross paths her in their lifetime."</P><P>While they struggled against their stone prisons, Ino and Shikamaru were running towards the temple to give aid. As they were about to enter they were stopped by the old woman's cat. It hissed at them and right before their eyes it transformed. It grew bigger, its tail grew longer and became split, fangs and claws sharper and stronger until it become a seven-foot long beast with a forked tail. "Come on, it's just one cat. We need to help the others." Ino said frantically.</P><P>"I have a feeling we won't be able to." He said. Shikamaru groaned. <I>Where are they? We could use the help right now.</I> He thought. The beast sat where it was and stared at what could be its next meal. It opened its mouth and instead of a growl words come out. "You will wait here until Mistress Baba is finished, or else you will deal with me." Ino's jaw hit the floor. "That thing can talk!?" She screamed. "What are you?" Shikamaru questioned the monster.</P><P>Its bright beige eyes turned to Shikamaru. "I am called a bakeneko. My name is Mata and I am a servant of the Demon Witch Baba. She has used this temple to lure in curious wanderers to devour. Anything she cannot eat I take care of and right now you two would fall neatly into that category." "I've been through all kinds of books and I remember everything I read, and not once have I come across anything like you." Shikamaru stated.</P><P>Mata's face contorted into what could be designated as a smile. "It would surprise me if you did. There are so very few humans who even know of us. The most popular of our kind you know as the tailed beasts. But there are more, so many more of us of many shapes and sizes. The world has more in it than you realize, things that you should never bear witness to. Only now it's too late for you and your friends, my mistress's powers are far stronger than your skills." He said.</P><P>"Are you sure about that?" A shadow appeared above Mata and a figure landed on him before he had a chance to move. Mata, about to retaliate, was stopped by a bandaged weapon. Shikamaru smirked. "Well, better late than never I suppose. A little earlier would've been nice to." Kisame flashed his pearly whites. "Sorry about that. Itachi wanted to see how much he could get out of this one. I have to admit kid, I knew we would be used to take care of the enemy, but I didn't think it would be something this interesting. I might just stay with you guys if I wasn't a wanted fugitive." He said.</P><P>Kisame leaned in closer to Mata's face. "Why don't we take a look at your mistress and see how she's doing, shall we?" The three of them entered the temple with Shikamaru using his Shadow Possession justu to keep Mata under control. Baba was about to consume Hinata first when she saw the others along with Mata. Kisame took one look at her and laughed. "Ha, and I thought the blond kid had a big mouth on him! I'm sorry to spoil your meal, but we have to talk. My comrade believes you can be of use." He enlightened Baba and to her astonishment found a kunai at her throat and three shuriken digging at her back.</P><P>"I have a bargain I wish to make with you, Baba." Itachi said. Baba's face changed from bewilderment to one of greedy curiosity. "Well now, if it isn't the young Uchiha prodigy? It has been a long time. How have you been?" She asked her face turning back to normal. "Other than the fact that almost my entire clan is gone and my little brother wants to kill me, life's not bad." He replied.</P><P>Kakashi was dumbfounded. "You two know each other?" Itachi removed the weapons from Baba. "In a matter of speaking, yes I know her. It was from her I discovered the information about the tailed beasts years ago. To explain, Baba is a demon hag who indeed eats people foolish enough to come by her. Each time she does all of the memories and knowledge that her victims possess, she absorbs and makes all of it her own.</P><P>"It is known to those who know the existence of Baba, know that she <I>can</I> be reasoned with if you're willing to strike a deal with her. A trade of sorts: she gives information and in return she demands sacrifices. We haven't been in touch for such a long time now I actually forgot all about her, so I say that this was fortunate for us. I have a special deal to make with you but first I need you to release them." He said pointing at her captives.</P><P>"If I knew they were with you my dear, they would not have been harmed." She snapped her fingers again and the rock dissolved into sand. "Now do you think you can release my pet? He's of no danger to you now." Baba insisted. Shikamaru looked at Itachi who gave the go-ahead and dropped the justu. Mata growled at Shikamaru but silently returned to Baba's side.</P><P>"Good, now we can get down to business. You said to had something special to offer up?" Baba said with a profound interest. "That's right. This one is special, because the payout will exceed everything you've asked for but in return I ask that you join us in our mission to the Light Country far in the north."</P><P>An inquisitive look passed over her face. "The Light Country is it? The same Light Country that houses the prison known as the Nine Hells would it? I've heard very disturbing things about that place recently." She asked petting Mata on the head. "That's the one. I have a feeling that we could use your help in getting there and getting out if required." He answered. "And this "payout" you described? What makes you think that it will be worth my time?"</P><P>Itachi smiled and countered, "Because of some new information me and Kisame obtained while we were there, regarding something of precious value to someone of your…experience. Not to mention all of the "sacrifices," you can find there, ripe and fresh for anyone to take. Do we have a deal?"</P><P>Baba stopped stroking Mata and reached for her cane that she dropped in all the excitement. Grabbing the top she pulled and it came off. The inside was hollow save for a rolled up piece of paper. She pulled it out and unrolled it, presenting it to Itachi. He took his kunai, cut his thumb and wiped the blood in one stroke. When he did the paper glowed red and more writing appeared, showing a signed contract.</P><P>"Itachi Uchiha, you have a deal. You will have the support of me, my knowledge and all manners of creatures I call upon. But should I be cheated I will have your life in place of my prize. You understand of course?" Itachi bowed his head in acknowledgement. "Yes Baba." Baba put the paper back in her cane and Lee, who was the only one still covered in dust, spoke up to Baba.</P><P>"Now that we are working together I was thinking of something that may have been on everyone's mind. The carvings on the tablet, of the man and the bat and the others, what do they mean?" He questioned. Baba looked upon said stone. "It is hard to explain, but it may make sense later down the line." Itachi shook his head. "For the first official piece of business, what will be facing now that we have your aid? Tell me everything." He said.</P><P>Baba smiled her wide smile and told them a great deal of things, all the while the most important one that Shikamaru heard Mata say. <I>The world has more in it than you realize, things that you should never bear witness to.</I> "What did he mean when he said that? I can believe that there are more of these things existing in our world, but what else could there be?" He said to himself with all new concerns in his thoughts.</P><P><B>A/N</B>: A little longer than usual but some things needed to be explained. Cyber cookie to whoever can tell me what the tablet really means. I want to point something out to Caitlin who in turn pointed out something to me. Itachi as powerful as he is will have a different role to play than just be an epic ass kicker like a prodigy should be. He, and some of the others, will have some awesome fight scenes in the future, just not yet. I have to think it out like everyone else does.</P><P>Another one is that the Kyuubi isn't demonic enough. While it is true that the Kyuubi is a blood hungry spirit of death, I made her out to be less than such because of two things: one is the most notably obvious, is the fact that Naruto and Yunika are holding back a nuke sealed away inside of him (evil laughter). The second is because I am holding her back for an essential scene in the future where I will show her true colors and she just rapes and kills for a time. You are welcome. Read & review as always.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 10</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">Let's get Demonic</p><p>(Late afternoon, with Naruto)</p><p>Naruto was hiding behind a small hill, his eyes just peeking over to see a farm. A red barn with its doors wide open leading out to a fenced-in area holding in goats and a house off to the side.</p><p>Naruto sighed out of boredom and impatience. "What are we doing waiting here like this?" He said. <i>"You need to work on the Vampire Judgment technique. We have a goat farm ahead of us. You do the math."</i> Yunika replied with an equal level of ennui. "So we're going to practice on goats?" He said. <i>"Would you rather practice on humans?"</i> Her voice heavily layered with sarcasm. When Naruto didn't respond Yunika sighed. <i>"Are you still upset about earlier?"</i> Naruto was still silent as his thoughts were elsewhere…</p><p>(Three hours ago)</p><p>Naruto was with Yunika inside his mindscape, him leaning against the bars and Yunika inspecting the back seal for new cracks.</p><p>"Okay, first stage is done: master basic control over draining chakra from an established chakra link. The second stage is to reproduce the same effect, but with something that doesn't have an established chakra link with me nor have actual chakra of its own. So how do I manage that?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"It's easier said than done. Humans have a chakra network interwoven into their bodies, active or not it can still be of use to us. For this stage to work you must be in physical contact at all times while using the justu until a connection is made. The advantage is you won't have to seek out the chakra as it floats around in the atmosphere. The downside is you must make a link with an alien body." She told him.</p><p>Naruto thought about how he could accomplish this and as he did he was watching Yunika. Ideas sparked up and were shot down while one repeated itself over and over, one that's been on his mind since he first laid eyes on her in her human form.</p><p>Yunika stepped back from her assessment. "Some new cracks have appeared on the seal but none of them are a serious threat. We should still have enough time to get to the sword and fix it with plenty of time to spare." She approached the cage bars and saw Naruto was troubled. "What is it? What's wrong now?" Naruto entered her cage and took a deep breath.</p><p>"Let's get something straight. I've been thinking about everything that's happened so far and I don't like this, any of this. The fact that I'm carrying a demon inside me, the fact that said demon who, out of hatred and spite, locked away an incredible amount of power that is now threatening to level a good ninety-percent of the continent, and the fact that I can't remember any of that happening to me." He confessed.</p><p>Yunika said nothing, her face jaded. He grabbed her shoulders and forcefully but gently shook her. "I need to know why I can't remember anything about you or the power you have. I remember beating that boy Haku to a pulp from when I was twelve. I remember practicing with Pervy Sage and scarring him when we left the village to train for three years. I even remember going against Orochimaru and giving him a run for his money. But when it comes to you or how I did it, I draw a blank. Now tell me why that is."</p><p>Yunika was silent like a graveyard as she matched stares with the agitated blonde. One look in his eyes told her he wasn't just simply concerned, deep down he was terrified, and she felt strange that she could tell. "It was necessary." She answered. "Necessary? Why was it necessary before now?" Naruto demanded.</p><p>Yunika pushed his arms off. "It was necessary for my peace. After everything I went through with the other hosts, even when I was out, all I wanted was to be left alone. When I was sealed away it was to contain my power and to be used as a weapon of war. I couldn't see or hear anything and on the briefest of moments I could speak with my 'jailers,' they didn't say many pleasant things. But when the 4th Hokage sealed me into you, it was different.</p><p>"I watched every hour, every minute of your life go by from day one to this very second. I saw your hardships and your achievements, how hard you worked. When you went up against that Haku boy, when you saw your teammate fall, I saw a side of you I never thought I would see: a burning hatred, a monstrous blood lust, in a flash of time you showed the world my pain, my anger unleashed in all its fury. When that happened, the seal cracked under the pressure of your emotions and a tenth of my power came out, resulting in your victory.</p><p>"When the seal cracked you entered my prison for the very first time. When you did I placed a justu on you so when you left you would forget everything that happened. More times you tapped into my power and more times to entered my prison, all events forgotten. But when this problem came up I decided not to erase your memory. Don't mistake what I did for your sake. Everything I did, I did for my survival." She said.</p><p>Naruto was stunned. "So there are parts of my memory that are gone?" "It's more like they're locked up. When you left the memories stayed behind and I put them away in the only place I could." She said turning towards the weakening seal.</p><p>Naruto went to the seal and placed a hand on it. "So the more it breaks, the more memory I'll get back." He muttered. Yunika stared at him as the silence went on. Naruto turned and gave her a pleading look. "I may not have gone through what you did Yunika but I can tell when something is wrong. What else aren't you telling me?"</p><p>She opened her mouth to speak, stopped herself to gather her thoughts and when she did speak, she did so with a restrained vehemence. "When you first used my power I saw a dark side I've never seen again since that day, but it tells us something: the fact that I saw it means you still have it. I say this merely as a warning. You have something about you that can become infectious to others. You have power, more power than you know and you will only get stronger. If that darkness should ever take hold of you again…"</p><p>(Present time)</p><p>Naruto stood up from his hiding spot and made hand signs. "Let's get to it. <b>Shadow Clone Justu!</b>" He said and summoned a clone. <i>"What, now?"</i> Yunika's voice sounded surprised. "You said it yourself; we don't have a lot of time to waste. <b>Demon Style: Vampire Judgment</b>." He drained the chakra from his clone and transformed. He closed his eyes and willed her essence to merge with his mind. "<b>Demon Style: Demonic Ascension</b>." He called out.</p><p>When his hand changed into claws and the world turned into a light show, Yunika's voice resonated with his thoughts. <i>"Demonic Ascension, hmm?"</i> <i>"Yeah, I chose that for when we mesh minds and I have the other technique going. Now give me a minute to get into position."</i> Naruto sprinted from his spot and made for another small mound decreasing the distance with each dash.</p><p>Less than thirty seconds passed and he was in the waning shadow of the barn, watching the luminescent phantom lights. <i>"I count fourteen</i> <i>goats here, seven smaller animals in the barn, possibly mice, and… three people in the home. The scent of hay is strong and there's a coffee and food scent coming from the house. From this I can guess that the owners won't come out for a while."</i> Naruto thought to her. <i>"Okay that's good. How do you plan to attempt this?" </i>She asked.</p><p>"<i>I have most if it thought up. I'm just trying to figure out one part. Let me try something."</i> He crept up on one unsuspecting goat. The animal spotted him and gave him a dull look as it chewed up some grass. Naruto put a finger to his mouth for the universal sign of silence. He held out his right hand and advanced on the beast. The dull look kept on and then it turned away.</p><p>Naruto placed his hand on the goat and focused. His hand glowed blue with chakra and stayed that way for about five minutes. Five minutes and ten seconds later he stopped in frustration. <i>Nothing is happening! What am I doing wrong?"</i> He thought. He tried again and nothing happened. Three more times he tried and three more times he failed.</p><p>He put his hand on the goat again when Yunika stopped him. <i>"Before you try again, I have an idea that might help"</i> She offered and Naruto paused. <i>"I'm listening." "The streams of light you see coming from everywhere and everything, look at them again. Study all of them and tell me what's different." </i>Naruto's gaze moved from the house to the barn and each one of the goats. His eyes became fixated on the one closest to him.</p><p>A misty white glow emanated from the animal and he looked at the one next to it. This one was a dark shade of green. <i>"The colors of their life auras, they're different. What does that have to do with anything?" </i> He thought.</p><p>"<i>When a chakra link is made there isn't just the two beings the one who made the link and the one they connect to, there's also a medium involved. A medium is what helps the link truly connect when a specific offering has been given. One form of this is the summoning contract. In order to summon you need to do the proper hand signs required and blood, then you think about the creature you want. The contract acts as the medium and from there, acquires said creature from its current spot to where you are. Here you need a different medium for the same purpose. </i></p><p>"<i>Not everyone has chakra but they do have life auras. Like I said before, life aura is the soul essence of a living thing. Chakra is the combined form of energy used to train the body and use justu. Life aura is the ethereal energy that all living creatures have. Chakra and life aura are one and the same in a sense; when you run out of chakra and overexert it you die and when you lose your life aura you die."</i> She explained.</p><p>"<i>So what you're saying is that essentially I can use life aura to make the link?" </i>He guessed. <i>"Nail on the head. Life auras are always a different color, none are ever the same. But some come close and those that do usually go well together and when they do they make a link of their own. In theory if you can find one that comes close to your life aura color and try the technique, it should succeed." </i></p><p>Naruto looked down at his hands for the color of his life aura. It was a brilliant hue of deep-red. <i>"Red. Okay, what comes close to red?"</i> He looked at the goats for anything in the color spectrum that would work but to his disappointment none of them did, so he simply tried all of them. After an hour passed he removed his hand from the last goat and fumed. <i>"Nothing is working! I can't move on to the next stage if I can't beat this one."</i> Naruto grumbled.</p><p>He sat down and crossed his arms in thought. He tried to think up a way he could go around, find a loophole of some kind. <i>"Chakra…life aura…chakra…life aura…they are separate and still the same…"</i> The words kept rolling around in his head so much that Yunika got a headache. <i>"Chakra…life aura…human…demon…"</i> His eyes flapped open as a spark went off in his brain.</p><p>"<i>You said that the two are similar in the way that people, ninja, need them right? Is it possible that they can change or be changed by an influence? Kind of like how I can use your chakra along with mine."</i> He asked her. Yunika thought carefully about it, pondering every detail she could think up. <i>"I don't see why not. I've been thinking about a way that might work, but you aren't going to like it."</i> She thought with an odd tone of satisfaction, which was becoming quite common for when she had something nasty in mind for him.</p><p>"<i>What, what am I not going to like about it?" </i>He thought to her now getting anxious.</p><p>"<i>Bite the goat."</i></p><p>He was so surprised he spoke aloud. "What?! You want me to bite a goat?! Why the hell would I do that?" He exclaimed. In his stupor he forgot about the people inside the home and when sounds started coming from there he hid behind the barn again and waited. When no one came out he started breathing again. <i>"Are you done with your ranting?" </i> Yunika thought at him.</p><p>"<i>Sorry, in my freaking out I must have forgotten about you wanting me to BITE A GOAT! Do you want to tell me why I need to bite a goat?" </i>He responded. <i>"It's an idea, a long shot mind you but still an idea. It's hard to explain but go with me on this. Bite the goat with your fangs and I'll take care of the rest."</i> She ushered him.</p><p>"<i>Fine damn it fine, I'll do it but I'm not going to enjoy it."</i> Naruto grabbed the one with the white aura and put a hand over its mouth to keep it quiet, then taking it into the barn he went to the far corner. <i>"Okay I have it here, now what?" "Bend its neck back and bite it there. It won't matter if you hit an artery or not, just don't kill it."</i> She told him. He did as he was told, took one more look back at the open doors, swallowed to keep his lunch down, and bit the goat on the neck.</p><p>Instantly the beast tried calling out and struggled against Naruto's grip as blood started flowing out, but he was firm as was his bite. <i>"Whatever you were planning on doing, do it now. I can't hold this thing for very long without hurting more than I have already."</i> He hurriedly thought. Little did he know Yunika was already doing it for not a few seconds later it stopped thrashing around and was still. Through Naruto's eyes he saw the life aura of the animal slowly start to change from white and darken to red.</p><p>Sensing that was his cue he tried the justu again and put his hand on the goat. Nothing happened at first then a small surge of energy came rushing out and he absorbed it. <i>"What did you do?" </i>He thought while he focused on how much he drained. <i>"You can let the beast go now. The idea I had was to find a sort of symmetry between your chakra and the goat's life aura. I acted as the medium for your will to take your chakra and change the goat's life aura with it so both life auras matched, therefore allowing the justu to take effect."</i> She said.</p><p>Naruto unclamped his jaw from the goat's neck and it didn't move. <i>"Will the goat be okay after this?" </i>Naruto wondered. <i>"It should be fine. It didn't bleed out much so it will live and more importantly you've managed a big leap in the second stage of mastering this justu. The point I was trying to make was you needed to learn how to use the technique on something that didn't have chakra and find a way to convert its energy into chakra. The real purpose here was for you to learn how to harmonize chakra and life aura with another creature, in this case a goat."</i></p><p>Naruto took his hand away from the goat and it stirred like it just woke up from sleeping. It gave Naruto the same blank stare from before and ran back outside. <i>"Now that we have that part done, how about we get moving? Don't want to be seen by the owners looking like you do now, do you?"</i> Yunika considered. <i>"I'm with you on that one. Time to get back on track!" </i>He replied and after taking a cautious look around the farm he made for the north.</p><p>(Two hours later, dusk)</p><p>Naruto sat in front of a crackling fire, his eyes closed to enjoy the peaceful calm as he tried desperately to forget what he had to do. "I can't believe you had me bite a goat. That thing stunk something awful I'll have you know."He grumbled. Yunika was in hysterics. <i>"At least one of us enjoyed the lesson!"</i> She said in between laughing fits.</p><p>"It seems like the only way to get you to show anything close to emotions is either when I piss you off or you make me do something disgusting at your dispense. It's probably the closest I've seen or heard you be human." Naruto said irately.</p><p>That comment stopped her cold. Naruto didn't notice even though he had been listening to her laugh it up since they left the farm. She was quiet for a bit and then said, <i>"Naruto, what do you know about demons?"</i> <i>Why ask me that? Feels out of character for her…must have been something I said. </i>He thought to himself.</p><p>"Only what I know about the other tailed beasts." He answered. <i>"I thought as much. Humor me, have you ever wondered about where they came from or what they really are? What ever happened to them?"</i> She asked with a sense of interest in her voice. "What is this, a moment of nostalgia coming over you? I don't think we should be focusing about stuff that for now." Naruto said coolly.</p><p>"<i>Maybe you're right. I do think that it's time to add something new to your repertoire, as a reward for putting up with today's…training abnormality."</i> Yunika said trying to contain her growing laughter."Abnormality my ass, I bet you had that planned." He said irritably but was curious. When it came to justu Yunika had been helpful so far.</p><p>"<i>Now, now, save the attitude for later. You remember what I said about the chakra link and mediums correct?" </i>She asked and Naruto told her he did. <i>"When I explained about you turning into a demon sage and the powers that come with it, I left out a little nugget. Besides what I told you so far, they can also summon otherworldly creatures and I'm going to teach you how to do just that."</i></p><p>Naruto looked up at the darkening sky. "Didn't you mention something like that? What did you call them, Shikigami right?" He pointed out. <i>"That's right but they come from a different class of beings you can control. What I'm going to teach you is how to summon a demon, using me as the medium."</i></p><p>Now clearly paying attention, Naruto asked her a series of questions regarding how it was different from a normal summoning and what she meant by using her as the medium. <i>"It might take a while to explain so I'll make it short: it's the same way how you normally summon, except I'm needed for it to work. To summon a demon you need the right requirements for it and something of demon origin it will recognize, namely me. You will be summoning something simple, an old friend of mine from another time to be more accurate." </i>She clarified.</p><p>Yunika had him carefully go through the proper hand signs and when he could do them all perfectly she told him the last part. <i>"Now how you summon this one is simple. Do the hand signs and offer the blood like you always do, but don't slam your hand on the ground. Put it in the flames and call out the justu."</i></p><p>Naruto stopped before he made any hand movement. "Hang on just a minute. I bit a goat earlier and now you want me to burn my hand? I'm not so sure about that." He objected. <i>"You'll be fine. I know I'm not the right one to say it, but you just have to trust me on this. I promise you won't get burned."</i> She swore.</p><p>Naruto hesitated but did it none the less. He went through the hand signs, bit his right thumb just enough to draw blood and forced himself to put his hand in the blaze and called, "<b>Demon Style: Summoning Justu</b>!" Sure enough he didn't feel any pain. What happened next was very intriguing: thick black smoke started to rise from the flames. More and more it appeared until a cloud of it floated away from Naruto and stopping on the other side of the fire, then began accumulating, forming a man sitting with his legs crossed.</p><p>The man had dark skin like the smoke that made him up and long black hair tied in a ponytail. He wore a robe with the left side removed and Naruto could see various scars on his body. Worn sandals covered his feet gibing the appearance that he traveled all over the world. His face was also covered in scars; three vertical scars over his left eye, a long one starting from his right eyebrow and curved inward ending at his chin, and one more on his forehead in the shape of an X. His robe's colors seemed to constantly change, like it was alive; they went from ash gray to bright orange to its present color, hot yellow. The man's eyes were just as black as his skin.</p><p>His voice had a deep tone to it. "Who is it that calls me? Speak now." He said. "<i>Wow I can't believe that worked." </i>Naruto thought to Yunika. <i>"Why are you always surprised when something I plan works?"</i> She said offended. <i>"Call me cautious. I like to learn new justu I just think it's weird. So what is he?" "He's called an enenra, a smoke demon who doesn't really have a name so I call him Enra, and he's a very old friend of mine."</i> She said with a sound pride.<i> I didn't think demons had friends. </i>Naruto thought.</p><p>"<i>Okay, convey everything I tell you to tell him." </i> She instructed. Naruto heard her out, his eyebrows rose a few times, and spoke to Enra. "I am Demon Sage Naruto Uzumaki, child of Konoha, warrior of the Hidden Leaf Village and host to the Kyuubi, of whom I speak for." Naruto repeated.</p><p>"Oh? How do I know that it's really her I'm talking to?" Enra asked warily. Naruto's eyes flashed red and turned back. "She says it's good to see you again Enra." He said.</p><p>Enra's coal eyes lit up and he smiled. "Ah Kyuubi, it has been far too long. The years go by so fast for me what I think is a day is really a year. And as for you boy, I didn't think the Onmyoji existed anymore. But enough of that, why have you summoned me?"</p><p>Naruto held up a hand telling Enra to wait. He grabbed his bag and rummaged around in it, pulling out a long piece of white translucent fabric. Naruto bowed his head and held it out to Enra. "Yunika says those in favor of a long overdue debt to be paid, have those to thank for when their time has come to free them of their burden and offers this as a token of trade." He relayed. <i>Talk about old school.</i></p><p>"She goes by Yunika now, does she?" Enra chuckled and studied the material with an experienced eye. "The offering is acceptable. However I must first inquire as to what you ask of me?" Naruto looked up at him. "My wish is for you to accompany me on my journey and aid me anyway you can." He said.</p><p>Enra didn't say much, but he took the cloth and draped it around his neck. "Only because it's you 'Yunika', I will help this boy and clear my debt with you. To honor this scarf I will give you a useful item." He reached in his robe and pulled out what Naruto that to be a sake bottle. "This is a kameosa bottle. It is a very special bottle because any liquid you put in this bottle will never run out unless you ask it to empty itself." He said and handed it to Naruto.</p><p>He smiled as he put the bottle in the bag. <i>"That should prove helpful, if it's real." </i>Naruto thought to Yunika. <i>"It's real alright. Enra carries all manners of things with him, some more helpful than others."</i> She replied.</p><p>"I will travel with you as far as I can but there will be places I cannot walk. In such times I will change back into smoke and bind myself to this scarf you have given me. When I have done this you can communicate with me as long as you hold it in you possession. I can be summoned from any flame but if none can be made or found, use the scarf to call me to your side." Enra said.</p><p>Naruto nodded and removed the bag. "How about we get some shut eye? We'll need all the strength we can get." Enra agreed and laid back. Naruto mirrored Enra and placed his head on the bag. Closing his eyes the last thought he had rang through his mind like a single pure note in an echoing forest. <i>I wonder how Yunika knows Enra.</i></p><p><b>A/N</b>: Okay definitely longer than normal and I probably rushed some things in this one but I think I made good time. I wanted to get both events in this chapter with the life aura and Naruto meeting Enra because they both have meaning to the story. For anyone who does there research kudos to you for knowing what Enra and the kameosa bottle was beforehand, and yes you can all safely assume I will be using numerous demons, spirits, yokai and other boogeymen. (Naruto wouldn't be a demon sage if I didn't) If anyone would like to challenge me about the theory of the chakra/life aura bit I put in feel free to do so. Read and Review.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 11</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">The Ways and Words of a Witch</p><p>(Morning, with Kakashi and Shikamaru's group)</p><p>The dawning sun was shining over the grasslands, its rays landing on a dead fire pit in the center of an open dirt area. Everyone was getting ready for the day's journey. Hinata, Sakura and Ino were checking inventory, Lee and Mata were keeping watch, and Shikamaru, Kakashi, Itachi, Kisame and Baba were in the middle of going over the map.</p><p>"So far we're making good time. Right now we're here near the edge of the grasslands and we should make it to any of the port cities within less than a day's run. Naruto should be in the vicinity of this area so it's a high probability that we'll run into him before he tries to cross the ocean. Baba can explain the next part." Shikamaru explained pointing to a spot on the map.</p><p>"There are three port cities that have routes to the Light Country: one to the northeast, and two to the north and northwest. The one we want is at the northeast, located in a small outcast harbor. I know one of the harbormasters there and he owes me a favor. Long story short, I'm the reason he still has a marriage. He can give us a private boat to the Light Country, simple." Baba said. The other four looked at her with the same thought running through their heads: <i>I don't want to know.</i></p><p>Itachi looked back at the kunoichi trio while they talked amongst themselves. "While we're discussing the matter of information Baba, maybe you could tell everyone what you know about Nine Hells prison. You mentioned before that you heard some disturbing rumors surrounding the facility. Anything and everything you can tell us would give us an advantage in case a scenario comes up, forcing us to make a necessary retreat." He said.</p><p>"Very well, does someone have a large sheet of paper, four items that are flat and heavy, and something to write with?" Baba requested. Shikamaru had a pencil, paper and four shuriken and handed them to her. Baba took the shuriken and used them to hold down the sheet. Next she turned the pencil point down in her hand and slowly pushed it into the dirt. She placed her hand above it and, after muttering some words, pulled it out and began drawing on the paper. When she finished it showed a rough draft of what Shikamaru described as the Light Country.</p><p>"To begin, the rumors I heard about this place aren't very pleasant. From what young Shikamaru here has told you all about the island, everything is straight on. The Light Country looks like a paradise in the eyes of the unsuspecting world, run by the current lord of the land. However in reality it is under harsh dictatorship, ruled by Goturo with an iron fist and falsifies all information regarding Nine Hells prison as he passes it on to the lord.</p><p>"Along with funding from the numerous nobles of the world and other political officials, Goturo takes money from the island's people. When they don't pay, or they hold out, he 'releases' one of the prisoners unto the public until they gave everything they had, then he recaptures the prisoner. As a result they live in a chaotic and corrupted state of fear and poverty."</p><p>While she talked the picture shimmered and moved around in sync with her explanation. The picture changed from the outline of the island and zoned in on the prison structure allowing everyone to see it in clear detail. <i>Now that's something useful. I wonder how she did it.</i> Shikamaru thought.</p><p>Baba continued, "For the prison itself it's a nasty piece of work. The outside has seven elevated harpoon guns capable of puncturing through the toughest hull with tags attached to them for precision chakra control strings connected to whoever's manning the weapon, allowing them to change direction in midflight and five high powered cannons with chakra-empowered ammunition giving the rounds increased firepower for that little extra kick, all positioned on all sides of the prison walls. The only entrance in or out is a makeshift stone wall that becomes a temporary dock with any number of guards appearing on it.</p><p>"The inside is just as bad. While the five-foot bedrock that makes up the prison is strong it's the inside metal plating that can cause problems. When Nine Hells prison was created the stone that made up its structure and the metal that was made for it had special properties infused in it that turned every inch if it into one enormous security system. One of them steals the chakra and stamina from people that bear a mark the guards brand the prisoners with, to an extent. For transporting the criminals there are two means of traveling through the structure: a pair of steel hydraulic platforms with four guards that run through its entirety, even to the warden's office located at the very bottom.</p><p>"Each level holds all kinds of S-rank criminals who have high degrees of skills and powers, some of which you may have never heard of. They may be all S-rank but when placed in Nine Hells prison, they are put in a new system that rates them not for how dangerous they are, but for how long it takes to 'acquire' them. The longer it takes, the farther down they're placed and only the worst of them are put at the very bottom.</p><p>"Each prison cell is made to perfectly inhibit the occupant's power and restrict them as much as possible, making them as harmless as the breeze drifting across your face and their cells are made differently for each one. Each level has a different form of security measures as well, based on how they will affect the prisoners and how much of a threat the prisoners become, ranging from nerve gas to who knows what and I don't even want to know what's waiting at the bottom. The most curious part is that supposedly, this was all before it underwent…certain renovations." She finished.</p><p>Shikamaru groaned and put a hand to his face. "Okay, I don't about you, but that makes me worry a little. I'm going to assume you don't know what these new renovations are, which means we're back in the dark." He said. Itachi glanced at the drawing. "What interests me is how you know all this and how you made the picture come alive. You weren't imprisoned there were you?" He asked. Sakura came over and handed her report of the inventory to Shikamaru.</p><p>Baba cackled heartily. "Oh no, if I had been imprisoned there you wouldn't be talking to me now. I merely have fingers in a lot of pies as the phrase goes. The picture coming to life is easy to understand, it's just a simple spell. Magic, you see." She said. Sakura's ears twitched at the mention of the word as she just now entered the conversation.</p><p>"What's magic?" She asked now seeing the drawing move around. "That looks like Sai's justu. Sai is a teammate of ours and he uses justu that brings whatever he draws to life." She said. Baba removed the shuriken and rolled up the paper. "Magic is the word for the universal mystic energy that surrounds us all. I can utilize different types of magic because I'm attuned to it, seeing as I am a demon witch. For instance, I can use earth magic to affect the lead in the pencil and by connection, the drawing." Baba told her.</p><p>"Magic is very similar to justu. Our justu works by us utilizing the energies inside ourselves and using it to an extent whereas magic isn't confined to how much chakra we have and can influence the world around us when we become connected to it in some way." Itachi explained stoically. "It's good to know you still remembered what I taught you those many years ago." Baba said. Itachi shook his head. "I never forget anything I learn Baba. Maybe it's you who have forgotten, hmm?" He replied.</p><p>Ino and Hinata joined Sakura carrying everyone's packs. "We need to pick up some things before we attempt to cross the sea. Unless Baba can conjure things out of thin air, we'll need to make a side trip, which will take up more time than we have." Shikamaru analyzed.</p><p>Baba reached over and grabbed the report. "If its food you need, that won't be a problem. As far as equipment goes, you're on your own." She said returning the report and the other items to Shikamaru. Baba grabbed her cane to help herself up and slammed it on the ground. She muttered more words and let go, leaving it standing by itself.</p><p>Roots started growing from the cane's base and it grew thicker and larger. Branches began to sprout from the knobs on top, spreading and growing. Everyone had to back away as the roots tunneled through the ground with such vigor Lee and Mata, who were standing a good fifteen yards away, turned in surprise to see what was making the noise. When it stopped changing it was in the form of a giant tree. High up in its branches were loads of fruits.</p><p>Lee and Mata joined the group once everything quieted down. "That is incredible!" Lee yelled his eyes glowing with amazement. Mata rolled his eyes, "You really think that's incredible? Something tells me you'll have a lot of learning to do while you're with us. Mistress Baba isn't just capable of using magic. She is also heavily knowledgeable in potions, poisons, healing treatments, etc. Something like this is simple in our eyes."</p><p>Mata jumped and climbed up to the higher limbs of the tree and broke off a thin branch that had a piece of the fruit with his mouth. He brought it to Baba, who plucked the fruit and handed it to Kakashi. It looking like an orange but it didn't feel like one. It was orange and tiny black dots could be seen covering the skin but the skin itself felt like glass. "What kind of fruit is this? Is it safe for humans to eat?" Kakashi looked at it like it was about to come alive and take a bite out of him.</p><p>"Oh hush now, it's perfectly safe. That's fruit from a tree hosting a kodama spirit. A kodama is a nature spirit that dwells in many forms of flora." Baba said holding the broken limb. She turned it over in her hands and tapped it twice against the ground and it changed back into her knobby walking stick.</p><p>"The spirit of a kodama is carried in this cane, one that I saved many years ago. The kodama live only as long as the trees they inhabit do and are very helpful if you can get on their good sides. You think this was something special," She asked him pointing at the new growth. "You have no idea what she can do if angered."</p><p>Sakura stared incredulously at the new cane Baba had. "The kodama is female?" She said. "This one is anyway. Humans can't see their true form because they can't live very far from their home or they wither away. For this one it's because she's young and quite fearful of people." Ino gave the tree a proper once-over and looked at the cane. "Does she have a name?" She asked. Baba held the cane up and rubbed the head of it. "Her name is Sengen and we've been with each other for a very long time."</p><p>Kakashi shrugged and told Hinata, Mata, Lee, Shikamaru and Ino to collect what they needed. While they did Sakura and Baba talked more about kodama spirits with Itachi explaining as best as he could. Kisame and Kakashi checked and rechecked everyone's weaponry. By the time everyone was done with their task it was nearing noon. Shikamaru did a personal inspection over everything and seemed a little satisfied.</p><p>"Our food supplies are good but as far as going on the offensive or the defensive goes, let's just say I hope we don't run into a whole lot of enemies anytime soon, which brings me to something I forgot to ask. Do you know any sort of battle magic or tactics, something that could be of use in the field for stealth or intense combat? The tree was a nice trick but I don't need to tell you that it won't be of much use for fighting off foes that may outnumber us." Shikamaru said.</p><p>"I know enough youngling. If I didn't I wouldn't be here talking to you right now." Baba simply put with her trademark wide grin. "That's something else I was thinking about. The large scale genjustu field that covered the temple, did you cast it or was it something else?" Shikamaru asked again. Baba looked at him with a newly found interest.</p><p>"I'm going to assume you know something about it, the temple's secret." Mata's eyes widened with shock at the statement and turned to his mistress with something like alarm. Shikamaru noticed this and thought to use it. "I listened in on Hinata as she scoped the place out. She talked about the foundation and the tablet, how there was something in them she couldn't identify. I didn't think of it much when you appeared. If I put together what I knew then and what I know now there's something that doesn't fit." He started.</p><p>"Not just that either. You mentioned something about a young man with black hair, a sword on his back and strange red eyes. Your description matches up with a certain person that we've been looking for, Itachi's brother in fact. Maybe you could explain what went down." He finished.</p><p>Baba was passive, her head leaning to one side in amusement and her hand slowly moving over Mata's fur. "What you saw wasn't genjustu. It was magic and not my own doing. The temple has a barrier covering a wide radius that keeps it out of sight. If it should ever be found and dispelled, the field is brought back up when the intruder's presence has gone. I'll tell you more about it later. The young man, like you he discovered he was caught in its grasp and he was able to nullify it and enter the temple. I wasn't aware of him until he walked up the steps.</p><p>"I've been around the world in my years but for the time being I decided to use the temple as a baiting ground. I went through the same routine I did with you all but before I could make a move he told me he knew all about what I was and was only interested in making a deal with me. He wanted to know how many years the prison had been in use."</p><p>"Did he say anything about why he needed it?" Kakashi asked. Baba moved her head back and forth. "I asked if he had his head on straight, that nobody goes looking for me unless they're desperate or willing to pay the necessary price and he just tossed me a scroll." She reached in her robes and pulled out a black scroll with red bindings on each end and holding it in place of string was an iron ring with a seal on it.</p><p>"He said the scroll talks about some old secrets and that it should be enough for a single payment. Information for information, that's how the agreement works. It seemed good so I told him. The prison has been around for over a hundred years, a hundred-and-twenty to be precise. After that he ran off. I haven't been able to unseal it yet to see what's really inside, it really is unusual; it isn't a bloodline seal nor is it magical. I can't open it with my power but for the time being I believe it may be more suitable for one of you to hold on to it. Who knows, it may prove to be more beneficial to you than it has to me." She exhausted and held out the scroll.</p><p>"Are you sure you should be handing something like this over to us?" Kakashi asked. "A deal is a deal." She replied. Kakashi took the scroll and looked at the seal. <i>This is beyond me. It looks small but it's unlike anything I've seen. Whoever made this didn't want it anyone to get their hands on its insides too easily.</i> He thought wearily. "Itachi, I think this might be more up your alley of the weird." He tossed it to Itachi and Itachi examined it.</p><p>"Now, about the tablet…" Shikamaru started and Baba raised a hand to stop him. She poked her demon companion behind his ear. "Mata, please round up everybody and bring that strange boy with the large eyebrows." Mata dipped his head compliantly. Shortly after everyone was crowding around Baba and Lee was standing before her a blank look on his face. "You asked me before what the depictions on the tablet were. Since you are young and obviously willing to work with an old crone like me I'll tell you about it as best as I can." She started.</p><p>"The magic field wasn't just covering the temple it was also protecting the tablet. The tablet has magic that was ancient when I was young. If you look at it closely you would see that it's a part of something bigger; the edges are cracked as though someone broke it off something larger which means there is more of it though where the other parts are and how many exist are unknown to me. The piece residing in the temple speaks of a prophecy. Unfortunately the full meaning of it is unclear seeing as it is incomplete.</p><p>"The left side tells of a man with eerie powers lethal and dangerous. He is cruel and his heart incased in the deepest cold. He runs with unnatural creatures and wields a fabled weapon he uses to claim the souls of his next victims. His skills are unmatched even so that one day he will be known as the Kamikage, or the God's Shadow, not out of politics but out of fear; fear that he is Death Incarnate, the embodiment of demise itself. The man rides in and owns the darkness and he only cares about himself yet he searches for something and will have a choice to make.</p><p>"The right side speaks of three entities out of many that play a role in the man's future, each to come at different points in his life that will test the man's strength of character in hopes of diverging him from the path he chose out of hatred and to help him fight a great battle: two elderly men, brothers in arms since the day they were born, and a great dragon both wise and powerful.</p><p>"The one in the middle is the worst of the three. It talks of a fallen god who was banished and sent to Hell, cursed forever to remain in the abyss to rule over the devilish creatures of old. He yearns for freedom and covets revenge on those who cursed him by seeking out something called the Light of Five Presages and should he get his hands on it he will devour the world with the vehemence of his power. This is all the tablet says." She finished and took a deep breath.</p><p>Kisame whistled. "That sounds heavy. Personally I haven't been one to put money on Fate and all that." He said. Itachi looked at his comrade. "But what if it happened to be true? The oldest of legends do speak of such a power, the Light of Five Presages. It's unknown what it really is, but all of them have two things in common: the Light of Five Presages must first be called into physical manifestation and it can only be done so by certain requirements, one of them involves bringing together three impossible things. Every myth has a grain of truth to it." He said oddly enthusiastic.</p><p>Itachi's change in character made Kisame raise an eyebrow, "What brought this on all of a sudden? You're normally so apathetic about everything." He asked with his shark-like grin on his face. "Let's just say there was something I was interested in before I left Konoha and leave it at that for now." Itachi answered.</p><p>During the conversation Mata watched the sky and the movement of the sun. Halfway through Shikamaru and Lee joined him, Shikamaru for obvious reasons, Lee because he didn't understand what was being said. Mata looked down at Baba and spoke with urgency in his voice. "Mistress Baba if we do not leave soon we will not be able to catch up with whom they seek." Lee quickly turned his head. "You mean Naruto? I know we're behind him a ways but how can you tell by looking at the sun?" He asked in his stupor.</p><p>Mata returned his gaze to the heavens. "I was given a gift by my mistress when she first found me. I can look into the sun without burning my sight and use it like a crystal ball. I can see the shadows of every human in the world that the sun creates while it is high in the sky. I have found your friend as you described him. He looks different but I know where he is now. At the moment he is running through large grasslands not too far from here, and he has a companion with him." He told them.</p><p>"Who is it?" Baba said. Mata stood on his hind legs and whispered the name in her ear and Baba's eyes widened at the words. "We must hurry! We don't have any time to waste." She hollered and to everyone's surprise, jumped on Mata's back and rode him as he ran off. Nobody moved for a few seconds then the moment passed and they were all in a hurry to catch up with Baba, Ino and Sakura barely having time to gather their belongings before running after following them in frenzy.</p><p>The two of them caught up with Kakashi and almost ran into him at the breakneck velocity they were running at. "Kakashi-sensei, what do you think has gotten her so riled up?" Sakura asked in between breaths. "I don't know but anything that can aggravate an old witch like her may be something we can use in the future." He replied and ran after her as fast as he could.</p><p><b>A/N:</b> Okay, to those who are with the story so far earlier I mentioned anyone trying to translate what the meaning of the tablet was. Some people got it others didn't. So I'm going to show you the guesses people tried. Prophecy and puzzle piece was a good guess, about three others said summoning slab, one got decoration. I want to thank th4n for helping with some details on the matter of where the fuck they are, so thank you. Next chapter I'll reveal more of Naruto's demon sage powers and we find out what else Enra has in his robe. Also we start on the sea voyage part of the story.</p><p>P.S. Memphis my old friend asked me in this chapter of where the story is going. To answer all questions this will be slightly off story line. The events will happen as they have happened in the canon, this one will just take place away from it and as I'm typing this I now realize I should have mentioned this earlier. Later on there will be a few time skips that will relay more about what's going on in the main world and what's happening on the shadows. Read & Review.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 12</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">The Makings of a Demon Sage</P><P>(Afternoon, with Naruto)</P><P>Naruto stood on a white sandy beach with numerous rocks coating the shoreline. The smell of salt was overpoweringly so he could taste it on his tongue. Enra's scarf, which used to be pure white now had dark clouds on it, was wrapped around his neck. Naruto's eyes moved from one end of the beach to the other and smiled seeing nothing but more rocks, water and sand.</P><P><I>Well, looks like I lost the wager.</I> He thought, his mind going back to when he and Yunika made the bet. Seeing that the coast was clear he removed the scarf and lightly blew on it. The clouds on it started to shift and floated off the fabric. They swirled around next to him and formed Enra. "It's a nice trick that I can just carry you around on a piece of silk." Naruto said. Enra stretched. "It helps when trying to be inconspicuous and I need a place to hide, but it does take its toll on the joints after a while."</P><P>Enra took a look around. "I see we made it to the ocean. Why call me out now? Are we not taking a boat across?" He asked. Naruto shrugged. "Beats me, I was wondering the same thing. Yunika thought it would be better if we took another route to the sword's location instead of taking a boat, something about people asking too many questions. Remind me again where it is we're actually headed, since no one really told me anything for the entire trip I've been making, except that I'm looking for a sword."</P><P>Enra put a hand into his robes. "I thought I explained it to you while you were walking. Our destination lies at an island in the north called the Light Country. The island has a prison at its center called Nine Hells prison which holds the object you're seeking. We must find the island, get inside the facility, sneak past the obstacles and acquire the sword so you can fix the weakening seal and save yourselves."</P><P>Enra pulled out a folded up piece of wood and a roll of twine with a hook attached to one end. He unfolded it which became a stick as long as his arm, tied the string around one end, found a good sized rock near the water's edge, sat on it, reached into his robe again for something Naruto couldn't see and put it on the hook. "As a smoke demon I can hang around any blazing fire and when I do I can eavesdrop and oh, the things I have heard. The fire works like a gateway but I can't go into the physical world unless someone calls me out like you did. I can also travel all over the world from fire to fire if I have the means to do so. It's one way how I know about the prison and a few other secrets."</P><P>With a practiced hand Enra cast his line into the sea. Naruto had a senseless look on his face and did nothing for a minute but stare at Enra.</P><P>"What are you doing?" Naruto asked. Enra simply said, "Fishing." The silence carried on for another minute.</P><P>Naruto walked over to Enra's rock and looked out into the waters where Enra's line was. "Is fishing going to help us get to the island?" Naruto calmly asked. "It might." Enra answered. "How is fishing going to help us?" Enra planted the makeshift rod into the sand wedging it between two rocks and the one he was sitting on. "Find me a stick. Some driftwood will do." He told him.</P><P>Naruto search the beach for a half-hour and found a long thin piece of driftwood. He brought it back to Enra who nodded his thanks and started writing in the sand with it from where he was sitting. Naruto didn't recognize the hand and was silent the whole while. When Enra stopped Yunika spoke for the first time today. <I>"Let me have your arm Naruto."</I> He switched to thought-speak. <I>"What do you need my arm for?" "I need it to respond to him. Enra is trying to speak to me using this method." </I>She said.</P><P>Naruto squinted at the lines until his head hurt. <I>"You can understand this gibberish?" </I>He asked her and her response to that was another wave of annoyance. <I>"It isn't gibberish, its demonic writing. Like me Enra is a lot older than he looks and even then he's much older than I am. He's so used to using this method it's become a way for us to communicate without humans knowing what we're talking about."</I></P><P>Naruto reluctantly agreed and felt a strange sensation as his right arm moved on its own, clenching his fist and waving his fingers. <I>That's something new.</I> He thought. He removed the bag with his left hand and sat down next to Enra's rock. Using a finger Yunika wrote more illegible writing. Smiling that his old friend still remembered he waited for her to stop and then he would give his reply.</P><P>The sound of sand being moved around started to bore Naruto so he decided to pass the time with asking questions. "So Enra, how do you know Yunika, the whole thing with the debt and all I mean?" Enra took his time writing out his newest reply before he answered.</P><P>"In another time, a different time, she saved me from a most horrible death. If it wasn't for her, I wouldn't be here fishing and speaking with friends like I used to do." He said a smile on his face as he thought back to fond memories. "That sounds nice. What happened?" He asked. The hand Yunika was using came up and slapped Naruto in the face.</P><P>"Hey what was that for?!" He shouted at his hand now realizing how stupid that was. <I>"You shouldn't ask him something like that so casually. It's rude."</I> She thought at him. Enra looked up at him. "It's alright Kyuubi. He is young, not unlike you were not too long ago. It's vital for the young to learn all they can." He said understanding what happened and returned to his writing.</P><P>"Time, is what happened. Time, which is the essential thing that affects us all, is what changed everything. What happened has happened and there's nothing that can be done to change that fact. But," He paused to take a deep breath. "I have made my dues with what has become of my existence." He said. Naruto could sense a faint contentment in his voice, a sound resolve telling of a man at peace with a tragedy that occurred long ago.</P><P>"No offense, but you seem different than what I would have expected out of a demon. I thought most demons hated humans." Naruto said. "Most of them do but it isn't their fault. They are spirits of dark emotions manifested in physical form. All they can do is hate." Enra said. Naruto thought about this and smiled when an idea popped into his head. "Okay, let's say I buy that, what are you then?" He questioned his left hand ready in case Yunika took offense.</P><P>A sly look made its way onto Enra's face. "I believe everyone is entitled to their secrets. I'm a smoke demon that loves fishing and meaningful conversation." He replied. Naruto chuckled and felt satisfied with Enra's answer. "I wouldn't have thought demons had philosophies." He said.</P><P>Enra set the stick aside and picked up his fishing rod. "Trust me my young friend, when all is said and done you will learn more about us than you can conceive to believe. That reminds me, you and I discussed the methods of the technique you're presently working on and the troubles you seem to be having with it." He said.</P><P>"The part you told me, about the biting and the life aura. It's a fascinating, also foolish way to get it to work in such a fashion, using Yunika as a medium to finalize the justu. Though I don't need to tell you this, but you will need to find another way around that as your opponents won't be as willing as the goat you used. Did you see any changes in the beast by any chance?" Enra probed.</P><P>Naruto flexed his hand when Yunika stopped writing with it, testing to see if control was his again. "It's like I told you before; when I bit the goat and Yunika did…whatever she did, it stopped thrashing around and stayed still. When I released the justu it ran outside. I didn't stay to see if anything else happened to it." Naruto explained.</P><P>"A good thing you did to. Demonic influences are a powerful force, not to be lightly reckoned with." Enra told Naruto seriously while poking him with the end of his fishing rod. "When you bit the creature it opened a door that Yunika could go through metaphorically speaking. It's been done before by other demons. When they bite someone they can leave some of their essence in the person and by doing so it can have very surprising effects on them."</P><P>"How does that work? Does that mean there's going to be a giant monster goat roaming around the place?" Naruto asked</P><P>Enra chuckled. "It's a possibility, but not a likely one. The alien presence works like a deadly virus as it spreads throughout the body, killing it while healing and altering it at the same time depending on how much of it is injected. There's also the factor of different types to take into account. Yunika's chakra for example can accelerate your healing process because she resides within you but if introduced to normal humans it will instead become lethal venom that will burn like liquid fire being poured into their veins and it will kill them if not tended to immediately."</P><P>Naruto's mind was nagging at him about something he couldn't remember but he knew that it was important, something related to this. For the time being he brushed it off with the thought that it will come to him later. "That could be useful in the future. I'm not yet sure how I can work my way around this technique. I'll admit it's useful but I don't want to get used to biting people, I almost hurled when I had to bite an animal." He said. <I>"You've been through worse, you'll get over it."</I> Yunika said assuredly.</P><P>"Anyway the reason why I bring this up is because it relates to the powers of the Onmyoji. The Onmyoji, or the more easily understood term 'demon sages,' were powerful practitioners of Onmyodo, the way of universal balance. They don't exist anymore but back in the day the Onmyoji were powerful influences in the world, from wielding the elements and commanding magic to predicting the future and summoning any number of spirits to use their strengths. Take me for example: you summoned me here, you have it in you to use my powers anyway you see fit, as long as it's within my power." Enra said.</P><P>Naruto waved his hands in front of his face. "Hold on, back up for a minute. If these Onmewhatevers were so strong how come there aren't any more around?" He questioned with a confused look on his face.</P><P>Enra shook his head in disappointment. "They don't exist anymore because of the people's fear of them, the fear of where their powers came from. <I>Demons</I>, boy, their powers came from demons, sometimes by ways of summoning like you did with me and others that were more like you're situation. Like you they used their gifts for the better of man, dark powers against dark powers for the good hearts of the world. However some people didn't see it that way. All they saw was how powerful they could become.</P><P>"All kinds of ideas came to minds of the fearful, of how one demon sage with mastery of their skills could take on entire battalions and best them all. And think about it, the techniques used back in the day weren't as strong as today's. So the people decided to put them all down as quickly as possible. Some of them may have gotten away and lived the rest of their lives in hiding but even then it wouldn't have mattered. The damage had already been done."</P><P>"What damage?" "The demons that would help the Onmyoji stopped trusting them that day and without that trust they couldn't use their powers anymore. For those who summoned the demons to their side they simply went away, never to be seen again by their old masters. The ones who had the demons sealed away inside them would have to wait until their hosts' bodies died to be released. It's one of the many reasons why demons hate humans of their own accord."</P><P>Naruto imagined a warrior standing on a hill with a number of spirits at his back and many powers at his disposal. In front of the warrior was an army marching towards him. The warrior put his hand out and in a flash of light destroyed the army leaving nothing left. "I can understand why they would be afraid. Were you apart of what happened back then and do you hate humans too?" Naruto asked with a level of concern that surprised both Yunika and Enra.</P><P>Enra clasped Naruto's shoulder and shook him gently. "I appreciate your thoughtfulness. It's very rare to see that in humans, it shows you have a kind heart. Like I said before Naruto, I've accepted with what has occurred. Demons can change too you know." He told him. <I>"Maybe you could learn something from Enra, eh?"</I> Naruto thought to Yunika. <I>"Hah, you'll learn more than I did. Enra is crafty, shrewd and always three steps ahead. Sometimes I hate him for that reason, but here it will be useful to you." </I>She replied.</P><P>"Hey yea, I remember you saying something about the demon sages' powers. Everything you said about what they can do, do you think I could do it too? Not to mention what you can bring to the table, like what the language you were writing in when you were talking to Yunika and the travel by fire trick." Naruto said.</P><P>Enra moved his shoulders up and down. "The knowledge that the Onmyoji of old knew took months for them to obtain and then years to master. Their art forms of techniques and combat are similar in the sense of when you and Yunika merge but more complete and the transformation varies depending on the demon. Maybe a few justu, the 'fire trick' as you put it is more of an advanced skill. For now we'll keep it simple until you get that seal fixed. The demon language is a different story altogether. If you want I can teach it to you but maybe when the times are more agreeable. The conversation I had with her was about the fishing and something interesting she mentioned."</P><P>"Like what? Does it have anything to do with the demon sages or the weird justu Itachi put on me?" Naruto asked. He eyes shifted to Enra's line and saw it twitching as the lure moved with the tide.</P><P>"I'm not sure to be honest. She told me about the time when you first tried using the Vampire Judgment technique. After you passed out she discovered a mark on your forehead resembling from her description the third eye. Now, I've never heard of that happening before with the Onmyoji so maybe it's got something to do with this justu you spoke of." Enra said.</P><P>Naruto was about to ask what he meant by the mark when the fishing line started jerking about, nearly wrenching the rod out of Enra's hand. "Ah finally, it's about time." Enra said. He had a wolfish grin on his face and handed the fishing rod to Naruto. "Hold this for me won't you? Hold it tightly." Once again confused, Naruto grabbed the rod and just as he did a strong tug on the opposite end of the line yanked him from where he was standing and dragged him over the sand, pulling him into the tides.</P><P>"Enra what the hell is go-" Was all he got out until he hit water. The feeling of surprise was the only reason he still gripped the fishing rod with all his might and as a result he went farther out and deeper down until he stopped. He slowly opened his eyes and screamed as he saw an extremely long and large thing rush at him.</P><P>As soon as Naruto disappeared into the waves Enra calmly walked over and picked up the bag. He searched the bag and pulled out something, his grin growing in delight. <I>Ah Kyuubi, you knew all along I was going to do this. You're learning old friend.</I> He thought. An explosion of water made him turn around to see Naruto <I>still</I> holding on to the rod…and his catch.</P><P>Its body was like that of a giant eel, impossibly long as it rose out of the water with alarming speed, fifty feet, seventy feet, ninety and still rising. It was deep cobalt with sleek scales the size of dinner plates with a row of small spines running down the length of its back. The creature's head was very small in comparison to its body, no bigger than Naruto. It had big pale yellow eyes with no pupils on the far sides of its head and the row of spines cresting just above them. Behind the jaws there two large fins fanning out and behind them were three sets of gills. The creature's mouth was closed and the fishing line was in its jaws.</P><P>Naruto was coughing up water as he dangled from the fishing rod. He looked up to see the creature taking the bait so to speak. "Enra what the hell is this thing?!" He yelled at the top of his lungs. The creature looked down at him as though it had never seen a human before. Its jaws opened dropping both the fishing line and Naruto back into the water.</P><P>Naruto sluggishly walked onto shore ringing out his jacket, tossing Enra's fishing rod to the side. "Are you okay now or do you want to give me a hand?" Naruto looked at Enra handling something. "In answer to your question, that thing is an ayakashi. They're a type of sea serpent that has lived for a long time. They spend their lives mostly sleeping underwater and rarely do they ever come to the surface except for their favorite food, eel head." Enra said pulling out a jar filled with eel heads. Naruto stared unbelievably at Enra who set the jar down and tossed the object he pulled out of Naruto's bag to him.</P><P>"Okay one, I don't even want to know why you keep a jar of eel heads with you. Two, what are we going to do with an ayakashi?" Naruto said infuriated with him. Enra cocked his head to one side with a brow raised. "Is it obvious? Look at the contraption you're holding and you tell me." He replied and picked up the jar.</P><P>Naruto watched Enra walk past him to the ayakashi and opened the jar. It had an immediate effect on the sea serpent for its head bobbed up and down and in a flash dived straight for Enra, stopping just inches away. Naruto could see the beast's nostrils flare open as it took in the eel's stench. Enra grabbed one and held it out. The ayakashi sniffed it and slowly opened its mouth showing many small but notably sharp teeth. Enra tossed the head in and laughed as it swallowed it and nudged him gently for more.</P><P>Enra tossed in another one. "Ayakashis are gentle giants from the deep, despite their fearsome appearance. They live at the very bottom of the ocean and their scales are incredibly strong, virtually indestructible. On occasion some scales will fall off due to age and new ones will replace them, not to different from a shark's tooth when it falls out. In addition to the density the scales it also secretes oil that not only helps keep the shine, it's also highly flammable until it touches water, then it becomes useless."</P><P>Naruto looked at the contraption in his hands and his eyes widened in incredulity when he realized what it was. His gaze went from Enra to the ayakashi then back to Enra. "Are we gonna do what I think we're gonna do?" Enra's only response was a smile and said, "Oh, and make sure you don't forget the bag and my fishing rod. Few other important things we still need to do yet until we reach the sword." <I>"Like I said, crafty, shrewd and I hate him for that reason."</I> Yunika said.</P><P><B>A/N:</B> Yet another chapter under my belt. Sorry for the wait, been reading this great book by a guy named Brent Weeks, awesome story. Anyway, I'm pretty sure I don't need to say anything about the 'contraption' Enra grabbed as it kind of speaks for itself and yea, no real fight scene here and but hey in my defense if I saw something like the monster eel I wouldn't want to fight it either (the people really love their violence don't they?) And no, Naruto doesn't know about Goturo being an evil corrupt bastard, who plays a couple of big parts in the story. I put in some more info on the demon sage development, still thinking some things through on it and threw in the demon language thing of my own accord. Again, I apologize ahead of time for anything I may get wrong about the translations, still a bit rusty.</P><P>What will become of the mark on Naruto's forehead? What new and unbelievable justu will he learn on his journey?</P><P>When are Kakashi and Shikamaru's group going to catch up? And where the hell is Sasuke in all this?!</P><P>But the most important question that I predict will be on your minds is…how does Enra get this stuff to fit in his robe? All important questions, soon to be answered. Check in next chapter when we see a witch's methods of haggling her way onto a boat, I unveil another spook some can relate to and we get to see a special appearance. Read & Review, seriously folks it helps the story if the writer gets different opinions. I can't tell if it's good or not if no one's saying anything.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 13</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">A Sea Voyage with Rogues</P><P>(With Kakashi and Shikamaru's group)</P><P>Once Baba finally stopped her frenzied rush Mata told her he saw Naruto and his companion go a different way, away from the portside villages. Baba cursed herself for her rashness, how rare it was to be seen in an old woman she said, so they chose to continue on to the village in hopes of obtaining a boat and finding Naruto on the tides.</P><P>It was in the afternoon when they arrived at the seaside village Baba spoke of. The village was run down and looked as though it was struck by a hurricane; people were in the middle of repairing shops and those whose businesses weren't destroyed were having poor attempts to recover lost profits. Obvious-looking ruffians prowled the streets in hopes of mugging some unsuspecting innocent. Off in the far end of the village where the land met the sea, smithies could be seen stoking the blazes of their forges while harbormasters shouted out order after order to sailors.</P><P>"What do you think is going on?" Lee asked his eyes passing over the wreckage of a bakery. Kakashi eyed a man with a hand behind his back and a clear air of menace, probably debating whether or not to mug them. "It looks like it was under attack recently, but judging from what I've seen so far, I can't tell if was from outside the village or the villagers themselves." He said as the man walked passed, his eyes always on Kakashi.</P><P>Baba stood beside Kakashi, her pipe in her hand and Mata back in his small cat form with his body draped over her shoulders. "We're not here to see the sights, as fantastic as they may be." She said sarcastically. Shikamaru coughed to get everyone's attention. "This large of a group is going to draw unwanted attention. It's best to split up in pairs to avoid suspicion. Baba and Mata should be fine on their own. Itachi will go with Kisame like always, Sakura with Hinata, Kakashi with Lee, and Ino will be with me. When Baba finds the one she's looking for, she'll send out Mata to find anyone of us. Wander around like a tourist and keep your eyes peeled at all times until then." He told everyone.</P><P>They did as ordered and kept together, acting like nothing was amiss. Baba aimed straight for the harbor while everyone else inspected the available shops to see what was left: Itachi and Kisame checked out the blacksmiths for their weaponry, Hinata and Sakura passed through the food market and everyone else simply kept to themselves.</P><P>Shikamaru had one eye on the many destroyed stores and watched Baba with the other. Baba walked to a group of men shouting out orders and tried to get one's attention. Two of them saw her and with eyes wide backed away slowly. The third man looked at the two and turned around to see who it was pestering him. Shikamaru saw him look down at Baba with a face of aggravation one instant, then a kind smile the next and had, what Shikamaru thought he saw, fear in his eyes.</P><P>Baba said something to the harbormaster that made him throw his arms up and look around in a panic. It almost had have been comical if the two weren't surrounded by the wake of ruin. Moments passed and the harbormaster bowed his head in defeat. He pointed off in some direction and Baba nodded in thanks. She walked off and the harbormaster exhaled.</P><P><I>Sheesh, even though we went through something worse I </I>still<I> can't believe she's a demon witch. Oh well.</I> Shikamaru thought and sighed. Ino gave a sideways glance at Baba as she witnessed the event. "What do you think she did the last time she was here?" She asked. Shikamaru shuddered, "I don't even want to think about it."</P><P>Kakashi had his right arm across Lee's shoulders and Lee took in the sights from the village entrance. While Kakashi did lookout Lee asked, "Kakashi-sensei, if I may? I do not think it is a good idea to leave Baba to herself."</P><P>"What is it? You're not afraid for her safety are you?" Kakashi said. Lee looked out the village with worry. "It is not that. I do not fully trust her so it is not my place to say, but it seems to be a bad idea to let someone of her caliber walk in a town where she has history. Who knows what hidden past she has here? Not just her either; there is also Itachi and Kisame, who you have joined forces with all because of their knowledge on Naruto's whereabouts. Why is it that we are helping our enemies?" Lee replied.</P><P>"It's also something that's crossed my mind. We've acquired new allies with the same path laid out but that path has different endings. Sometimes on missions it's necessary to fight alongside our foes for something bigger than us. In this case that would be Naruto. I've been doing some thinking on that matter so don't worry about it too much." Kakashi said and smiled with his eye.</P><P>Meanwhile Baba walked past many men and women rushing to get their orders done along the docks. The triple tapping sounds of her feet and cane could hardly be heard over the crowd. Besides some normal civilians going about their day, she was the only other person not running around like chickens without heads, like nobody special.</P><P>Amongst the crowd there was a young man with dark hair, chest showing under a torn white vest, white pants tied to the waist with rope and sandals carefully shadowing her. Baba walked around the docks for some time, petted Mata on the head who jumped off and strutted away, tail whipping the air. Baba stared down into the blue waters and stood there. The man smiled cruelly and after looking around he brought out a small dagger from behind his back.</P><P>He moved without a sound, dagger raised in the air. As he was about to proceed with the mugging cliché he found he couldn't move his right foot. Confused, he looked down and saw the ground had grown over his foot. "I had a feeling someone would try robbing me. I'm just disappointed in your skills. I knew you had been following me the entire time." Baba said, right in his face out of nowhere.</P><P>In a panic he made a wild swing with the knife and was stopped by a sprout of rock shooting up and wrapping around his hand. Baba tapped the head of her cane against the man's chest twice and on the third time she pushed him with it. Tendrils crept out of the wooden bumps and started working their way up to his face.</P><P>"You have a decision to make young man. I'm going to give you the choice of how you die: you can be incased in stone that will slowly grow over your body and turn you into a living statue or you can have these," She waved her hand over the spidery coils hovering over one of his eyes. "Work their way into your body and do all sorts of nasty things to your insides…unless, of course, you have something to tell me that will give you time to think?"</P><P>The assailant was terrified of this ungodly creature and her ease at the words and actions of murder. "I'm sorry, I'm sorry! I was only paid to do this." He screamed. The tendrils eased back giving him some breathing room. "Oh? Is that so? Who paid you, and do try to remember quickly." She said and the tendrils started in on him again as to show her intent if he didn't.</P><P>"A woman, a woman came to me with money and told me to mug you. She said she was given the money from someone else, someone who said they knew what you are and they wanted to give you a message. The message was if you want them to know about what happened, keep up with what you're doing. If you need to find a way to read the scroll, talk to your friend. That's all." He said.</P><P>Baba's face turned to stone as she thought about his words. <I>Hmm, must be their raven-haired friend. Let's see what else I can squeeze out of this one.</I> "I'll ask you one more question, answer it truthfully and I will let you live. I'm looking for a certain person who lives around here, a man built like a gorilla with fiery red hair, possibly a beard and loves to drink. Where can I find such a man?" She asked in a sweet and mocking tone.</P><P>"C-Captain Shobo, Captain Shobo is the one you want. After a hard day's work he can found at the harbor's tavern. He should be there now." He squirmed. Baba smiled and pulled her cane away. "That's a good child. You may go." The rock surrounding his foot and hand crumbled away and he ran for his life. Baba started her search looking down the line of buildings for any sign of the tavern and begun scouring for it, oblivious to a figure hiding in the shadows, watching her from a distance.</P><P>Baba found the tavern her assailant talked about. She could hear booming laughter coming from inside and entered to see a man fitting the description she got sitting at a table in the far back. The laughter came from an ape of a man made from marble with short spiky red hair and beard to match. His clothing style was much like the man who attacked her: his upper body sported nothing but a pair of thick wristbands and a blue vest showing many scars running up and down his arms and chest. He had on large black pants and odd looking boots. Sprawled all over the table were empty sake bottles.</P><P>He spoke with a heavy tongue and his words slurred some. "Ah, noshing like a few drinshs to eash*hic* the pain of hard labor." He looked at the waiter and shook the near empty bottle he had. "Bring me anosher *hic* round, someshing wish a little strengsh sis time!" He yelled with gusto and took a drink. Baba approached the man and knocked on his table with her fist.</P><P>"Captain Shobo, I presume?" She asked gaining a drunken stare from him. He squinted at her with a bare glimpse of recognition. "I know you from somewhere, don't I? 'M shorry if I don't; 'm a bit off the seat if you know what I mean." He said. Baba heaved an apathetic sigh. "Come now Shobo, you hurt me. You don't have to play around with me. If anything you should be able to drink this place dry and two others like it and still be sober, or have you lost that knack since the last time we met?"</P><P>Shobo put down the bottle and laughed wearily. All of a sudden his intoxicated stupor vanished and any sense of him having alcohol disappeared along with it. When he talked his speech was steady. "I never could fool you, Mistress Baba. How have you been? Life treating you well I hope." He asked.</P><P>"I've been better. We always have interesting chats each time I visit and I never bothered but I must ask this time, why <I>do</I> you fake your drinking habits?" Baba sat down with him placing her cane on her lap. Shobo moved the empty bottles aside and laid his arms on the table. "The answer is quite obvious. If I drank too much my favorite tavern would be forced to close down. This place has by far the best sake I've had in years and I'm not too keen on having that happen." He replied.</P><P>Shobo looked past Baba and leaned in close. "Since you've come without your pet, I already know why you're here. Ask of me whatever you will." He said in a hushed tone. "Before I do, what happened to this town?" She asked.</P><P>Shobo put his hand to his face and groaned, "My brothers had another fight over a stupid bet, again. They seem to fight more regularly these days, every time they make port with their latest haul. If you came here a day earlier you would have seen it yourself, but you know just as well as I how they can be."</P><P>Baba cackled loudly, "Indeed I do. Boys will be boys after all. I can only imagine your wife has some words about the matter." "Oh she does and nowadays I'm starting to wonder whose worse, my brother's fights or her temper." He said and chuckled at his joke.</P><P>A serious look passed over Baba's face. "What's say we get down to business? I have need of your aid to get to a certain island. I have passengers and they're coming with me. We'll need special guides of course; you know the kinds I need. Our destination is the Light Country." She said.</P><P>Shobo leaned back and smiled. "It's like that is it? And the other things you always ask me about?" Baba nodded in silence. Shobo reached into his pants pocket and pulled out an envelope. "I managed to find one of the items you previously requested. It was 'acquisitioned' by a couple of officials and hidden away. I'm sad to say that's all I know for now." He said and handed it to her.</P><P>Baba took the package and bowed her head in thanks. Movement at the entrance caught Shobo's eyes. Itachi and Kakashi had entered with Mata out in front. "These must be the companions you spoke of." Shobo assumed. Baba turned her head to see them approaching. "That's them." He stood up and extended his hand in greeting.</P><P>Kakashi shook it. "This is the person you needed to find Baba?" Kakashi asked. "Yup, this is Captain Shobo, well-known mariner and sea merchant of strange objects. He's one of the harbormasters who runs the docks and will be the man to help us get to the Light Country. On a side note," Baba looked to Itachi. "Itachi me dear, could you pass me the scroll?" Itachi gave her the scroll and she handed it to Shobo. "I was also hoping you might know something about this. I can't open it nor do I know a thing about it." She said.</P><P>Shobo studied the iron band binding the scroll. He turned it over and over again, eyes always moving 'til they stopped on the seal. "Can I borrow a kunai from one of you?" He asked. Kakashi took one out and Shobo grabbed it his gaze not moving from the scroll. With swiftness he hit the metal band with the kunai producing a single ringing note that resonated throughout the tavern.</P><P>The sound still hung in the air when Shobo tossed the kunai back to Kakashi and said, "It's an old metalworker's trick I picked up. When you strike metal against metal at the right angle and level of power, you can tell how pure it is by the sound it makes. The clearer the sound is, the purer the metal. I can't tell you anything about the seal, it's not my forte. But I can tell you whoever forged the iron is highly skilled, not many blacksmiths can forge iron this pure. Every man who knows the bellows can recognize their work, show it around and you might get somewhere."</P><P>He gave it back to Baba and picked up the sake bottle, finishing it in one gulp. "My two cents, if you want to get anywhere with that scroll, you should focus less on the scroll for the time being and more on whoever made that band. We seadogs have a saying: it's easier to find a fish in a pond than water in the desert."</P><P>Shobo stood and walked up to Kakashi. He clasped his shoulder and shook it with a heartfelt grin on his face. "Well, let's get the rest of your group and find my crew. We're heading out as soon as you're ready!" He bellowed and ran out. Kakashi had a nervous look and asked, "His he, you know, okay?" Baba smiled her wide smile and walked out with Mata closely behind. <I>I hope that means yes. </I>He thought with uneasiness.</P><P>Once everyone was rounded up, Shikamaru swept through their inventory again. Sakura and Hinata bought more food to help make their supply last longer and Kisame had done some of his own shopping, finding some odd weapons and devices he thought might be of use later on. Itachi showed the scroll to every metalworker and got no results. Seeing they could do no more the ninja found Shobo and followed him to one of village shipyards. They passed a number of ships of different shapes and sizes. Shobo was standing in front of a majestic-looking corvette ship. Shobo spread his arms with a flourish, showing off the grandeur of his vessel.</P><P>"As harbormaster I have partial power over these docks so when I see a ship I like, I work on obtaining it and some ships I get by 'unspoken' methods. Although I have many in my collection this one is my favorite, the Blue Drunkard." His chest swelled with pride. Ino noticed the row of guns mounted on the port and starboard sides. "Are those really necessary? I thought you were a fisherman." She mentioned.</P><P>"What gave you the impression that I was a fisherman?" Shobo teased. "My siblings are fishermen who get carried away from time to time. I, on the other hand, am a connoisseur of finding and procuring strange and rare objects, call it high-risk trading." Ino gave him a dirty look. "So, you're a pirate." She said it as a statement more than a question.</P><P>Shobo grinned and shrugged, "It's a dirty term, but yes. Piracy is one of the things I do for a living. That and secretly ship people from point A to point B. My compensation changes depending on the situation and Baba has told me you're all going to the Light Country. I'm not on very good terms with that land so any payback I get, or goods I find from that place, I take. I have only one rule about my work and that's never to take an innocent life. I'm pretty adamant about that and no one knows that better than my crew."</P><P>Shikamaru looked around the shipyard. "Speaking of which, where are they? I haven't seen another person in this place since we walked in here. I mean, a ship like this needs quite a few people doesn't it?" He asked. Shobo was dazed for a moment at the question and then he knocked a fist against his temple.</P><P>"Oh I almost forgot, thank you for reminding me lad. Before we make port I order everyone to scatter using the life rafts save for two, for security and all that. They're onboard." He told him and walked up the plank. The deck was barren. The doors to the cargo hold were wide open and so were the doors to the lower levels beneath the bridge. "Mizu, Yuki! Your captain has returned! Front and center now!" He barked.</P><P>Two figures jumped out from the cargo hold and stood before the shinobi, both male. Both of them were tall and well built, one slightly shorter than the other. The taller one had a dull complexion and looked to be in his late twenties. He had shoulder length black hair and bandages covering most of his face leaving his eyes and mouth exposed. He had on a sleeveless black shirt with a high collar, metal rings fastened inside the collar and a pack attached to his left bicep. He had white pants with a wave design on his right leg and boots similar to Shobo's.</P><P>The other one had pale skin, looked to be eighteen to twenty and also had black hair though his was cut short. His outfit was the same, a few differences being he had a range finder equipped, instead of the arm pack he had gloves with thin metal bands that held several small diamonds, and a snowflake design on his right leg. "Tell me she's ready to go Mizu." Shobo addressed the one with the mummified face. He had a gruff voice like gravel being ground together. "Yup, we've just been waiting on you." Mizu replied.</P><P>"That's good. We have a new request from Baba. We'll be taking this group to the Light Country. In my ship the trip will take a day-and-a-half to get there so prepare to move out. We leave in thirty!" Shobo said. He tapped on Yuki's shoulder and Yuki followed him below deck and Mizu stayed behind. His eyes passed over everyone, stopping at Kakashi for the briefest of moments, which Kakashi caught and then Mizu followed the two.</P><P>Sakura motioned for Kakashi. "Kakashi-sensei, do you know that man? He looked at you like he knew you." She whispered. "I don't know but you may have something there." He said. He rushed up to Mizu and grabbed his arm. Mizu turned and scowled, "What is it?" He asked, irritated. "I'm sorry but have we met? You look familiar." Kakashi stared at Mizu intently.</P><P>Mizu pulled his arm away. "It possible, Shobo helps people travel everywhere. You may have been one of his previous passengers and just happened to see me then." He told him. Kakashi leaned in closer not blinking, not wavering. "No it isn't that. I've seen you before somewhere else, like a poster or a book…" Mizu rolled his eyes and walked off. "Tell me if you remember, maybe we can drink to old times we had." He said and waved them off as he made for the stairs.</P><P>Kakashi's thoughts drifted off to another time when he saw this man. It was on a mission, of that he was sure, but which one and where? He pictured this man in different forms and different scenarios hoping to bring something up, something that would strike a chord in his memory. Gruff demeanor, off-colored skin tone, and something was still missing. Then in a flash, something clicked. Kakashi was stunned by the revelation, knowing that it had been years since the last encounter with <I>him</I>. Kakashi knew that last time he saw <I>him </I>it was when <I>he</I> was on the verge of death with no hope of surviving.</P><P>But he had to be sure. He had to be absolutely sure because an important piece of the puzzle was missing. So he ran to Mizu again and stopped him. In a rage Mizu spun around, "What is it now? If you don't stop pestering me I'll throw you off this ship I don't care what Shobo says." Kakashi ran a hand through his hair. "I'm sorry again. One last question and I won't bother you anymore. Please indulge me." Kakashi beckoned for Mizu to lean in so as to not let the others overhear.</P><P>"From what I can tell you seem like the expert fighter, handy with a multitude of skills and weapons. If you weren't you probably wouldn't be alive in this line of work. So I have to ask, how is your swordsmanship?" Mizu's expressionless face told Kakashi nothing as he replied, "Good enough to keep myself alive. I don't like to use it much because it gets in the way when fighting on the ship but wait a while and you might see my skills soon."</P><P>Kakashi groaned and backed off. "Alright, thanks. Sorry to bug you so much." He said apologetically. Mizu walked down the steps and Kakashi went back to Sakura. "So, is he someone you know?" She asked. Kakashi's head was down. "Maybe, maybe not, but I guess we'll find out." He said.</P><P>Kakashi, Sakura and everyone went below deck to get ready for the trip ahead…</P><P><B>A/N:</B> Now we begin the sea arc of this journey, which will be followed by the prison arc and so on. If you know your Naruto, and everyone who's heard of it should, you should easily guess who Mizu and Yuki really are from how I wrote them. Surprise! Baba's been looking for something for a long time now, makes you wonder what it is. I know that the pirate thing was probably over the top, but hey, I like pirates. And who was it spying on Baba as she interrogated the poor man?</P><P>I had a bit of fun writing this one, much so that I'm making a game out of it this time: correctly guess what the spook is that I talked about last chapter and you will have your favorite Naruto character that I haven't added in, put in the story within reason and as a bonus the first person to be right will have one of their ideas written in as well, nothing that kills it though, the show must go on after all. Three hints will be provided and should be easy enough to make a guess at. Those hints are as follows: it is Shobo, it is a sea spirit, and it loves and I mean loves its booze. To the victor, goes the spoils, I will wait to do the next chapter after the game is over.</P><P>Next time around we get our first glimpse at the Light Country, we learn more about demon powers and their effects on humans, Enra tells us more on how he and Yunika met, and some other things. Read&Review.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 14</h3><hr><br><p><b>A/N: </b>Wow, ok I have got to do this. I can understand that this is only a fanfic, so must of it is just your classical thought up BS that you all love. However in my opinion what makes a good story enjoyable is some real world lore and facts written in, something that people can wrap their minds around and believe, just like how the original storyline was made. Last chapter I mentioned having a bit of a contest, something not only helpful to the story if someone succeeded, but you get to learn something new on your own.</p><p>Yet alas, only one person was victorious in having a bit of fun with myths and monsters, one Wolfish Imp, dear friend of mine, we talk over FB, who not only guessed who Mizu and Yuri were (made it easy), they also guessed what Shobo was (Again, made it EASY. Do your research if you don't believe me)! Turns out, bit of a myth nut, who would of thought? XD For those who DIDN'T get it, Shobo is a Japanese sea spirit called, wait for it, a shojo, remade for more modern times and no one but Baba knows who Shobo really is.</p><p>On a side note, at the begging of one reviewer I will not be making a harem for the time being, at least not until the policies change so if there is anyone who was reading this solely for the purpose of seeing the Naruto girls get their freak on, you may as well stop. Got to respect the rules on this one above all else.</p><p>Ok, I'm done ranting so let's get to the thick of it. Next chapter or so will be about Naruto working his way onto the island and into the prison, so he won't meet up with the others for some time.</p><p>Without further ado, let the next installment of Demon Love commence!</p><p style="text-align:center;">Class is in Session Part I</p><p>(On the sea, with Naruto)</p><p>The high seas were calm and steady as an ayakashi glided over the surface like a great blue mirror, its massive serpentine body carrying three people and leaving quite a spray in its wake. Just behind its head Naruto sat on a large harness rigged up around the head and part of the neck of the beast holding a strap in one hand and Enra's fishing pole with an eel's head on the hook in the other, while another Naruto was sitting with Enra on a hump raised high above the water.</p><p>"I didn't believe it at first when Yunika told me to get that thing-you should have seen the guy's face when I told him what I needed. Looked at me like I was asking him where the edge of the world was," Naruto blatantly said. "I never would have guessed I'd be getting to this prison place like this. It almost feels like she knew this was going to happen."</p><p>Enra was writing something on a scroll with a diligent hand. "I wouldn't put it past her. You'd never know it, but there was a time when Kyuubi was a mischievous little vixen of a youngling. But that was a long time ago and she has changed quite a bit since then." Naruto opened his mouth to say something and stopped himself. He sensed for the she-demon and felt her sleeping, as far as he could tell.</p><p><i>Seems like a good time to ask.</i> He thought. "Hey Enra, since we probably have a lot of time to kill before we hit land I've been wanting to ask, what <i>was</i> she like back then," Naruto asked. Enra stopped what he was doing and looked at him with a passive face. Naruto suddenly felt embarrassed asking and starting looking everywhere but at Enra. "Well, I'm asking because she asked me if I wondered about what demons really are and where they came from, and since you know her…" His voice trailed off.</p><p>"She's sleeping?" Enra guessed and Naruto silence told him he was right. Enra sighed heavily, wrapping up the scroll and putting it in his robe, "It only seems right of your interest in her past, and I should tell you more about our kind anyway. I shall begin with a story that should answer some of your questions, but before I do I have conditions. Beings other than Yunika and I have their fates twisted into this and I will not go about revealing more than I need to for their secrecy. Is that understood?" He said.</p><p>Naruto agreed and tried to get as comfortable as possible which was harder than expected when you're trying to sit still on a giant moving serpent. "Where to start…I think it best to begin at the fall of the Onmyoji. As I have told you when the people started to get rid of the Onmyoji, the demons who partnered with them left their side and vanished. The normal people believed that all of them were gone, back to wherever they were summoned from. But what they don't understand is we don't live in this world like your normal summoned creatures do.</p><p>"We all have a home of our own; a world mirroring yours, unlike anything you can imagine. Now I know what you are thinking, a demon world? It can't be anything good when you see its inhabitants in our true form, but it really is a magnificent place to see. There are unpleasant sights to be sure, but it has a somewhat eerie beauty to it, like that magic feeling you get when the time of owl-light comes just before night begins in your world."</p><p><i>An entire world of creatures like Enra and Yunika…I guess it's possible.</i> He thought. "Do all demons come from there? I mean what are they exactly?" Naruto asked. Enra rubbed his chin in deep thought. "How to put it in a way you'll understand," And he snapped his fingers and searched his robe. He pulled out a small kameosa bottle with a red wax stopper. He asked for a kunai and pried off the stopper with it, letting it fall in the water. "Imagine this bottle represents you as you are, a living, breathing human and the liquid inside is your soul." Enra said handing the knife back.</p><p>"Now imagine that you've died, it doesn't matter how or when. When you die your body becomes a corporeal vessel for your mind and soul." He held the bottle over his other hand and tipped it over, pouring out a sparkling ochroid substance. The thick liquid stopped inches above Enra's hand and began to fill an invisible globe. When he stopped pouring he held out a buoyant golden sphere. "This is your soul when it has left the body. The soul is the most powerful thing in humans; it's what makes up our very being. You are who you are because of it."</p><p>Naruto poked the floating bubble, producing ripples and retaining its shape. "What does the soul have to do with demons?" He asked in awe the bubble. "It's understandable that you wouldn't get it at first. Do you know about the prospects of Heaven and Hell?" Naruto closed his eyes scratched his head in thought. "A little bit. People who do good things for the right reasons go to Heaven and those who are corrupt and use others for their selfish reasons go to Hell." He replied.</p><p>Enra bobbed his head. "At least you know the basics. When you understand, it becomes simple. When you die your soul goes to either Heaven or Hell. Upon definition, where do you think the demon world is?"</p><p>Naruto kept on scratching and scratching and then eyes flying open, he said, "Hell is the demon world?" Enra smiled. "In more than one way, yes, Hell is our home. When humans die, sometimes they go to Hell. When they do, there are rare occasions when they're souls are filled with such hateful emotions they change, and they become demons. Do you remember when I told you demons are spirits of dark emotions manifested in physical form? When a human with so much evil in their heart arrives in Hell they transform into something that matches their personality and everything about their previous lives, what they did, how they lived, all of their memories wiped clean. It is your kind that fills the demon world with its residents."</p><p>"You used to be a human? Do you remember anything about your past life?" Naruto questioned. Enra raised the bubble over the bottle and the liquid was poured back in it. "None of us remember our past lives, but there are certain…" He looked at Naruto with a thousand-yard stare, like he was seeing something else. "There are certain memories that aren't washed away completely. There are times where some things can't be forgotten."</p><p>Enra stared on into an abyss unseen to Naruto who wondered what he was thinking. It wasn't until Naruto snapped his fingers in his face that Enra came back. "Oh I'm sorry, where was I? Ah yes, memory. When some humans become demons they have what are called Hearts, items sacred to them. From what I've heard, Hearts hold the soul of a demon as they were before they died, and not just their souls but also their memories too."</p><p>"I don't get it, what would a demon need something like that for in the afterlife?" Naruto asked. "Even in death, souls and memories still hold power. I'm not quite sure how to explain it, but if you can get your hands on one, you can use it to make yourself stronger." Enra told him putting the bottle away.</p><p>"Do you have one? Does Yunika?" Water splashed up against the ayakashi's scales. Enra took his time answering the question. He cocked his head from one side to the other in thought and looked up at the sky and down to the water. "I don't have such an item in my possession, but Kyuubi does," He said with a sideways glance. "Or rather, she did. Unfortunately, she lost it many years ago, helping me."</p><p>Naruto looked at him detecting some sadness in Enra's words with a trace of regret. "If it isn't wrong to ask, can you tell me what happened?" Naruto said. Enra stared at Naruto with his thousand-yard stare again. When he spoke he had a change in his voice, as though he was about to relief himself of a great burden. "I can't put my finger on it but there is something about you that I like youngling. Since you have asked I will tell you what I can.</p><p>"I had gotten myself into an incident that involved powers higher than my own. I was punished for years and when my sentence was soon over, so too was my life soon to end. Before the final note was to be sung, there she was out of nowhere to save my life. She used up all her power to bring us both into your world, but in doing so she left her Heart behind and with it, all of her powers."</p><p>Naruto raised his hand in silence and Enra nodded giving him the go-ahead to speak. "You mean to say she was more powerful back then then she is now?" He said skeptic of this claim. "Demons without Hearts are nothing more than a raw power source. While demons are powerful, those with Hearts have true power, abilities that would put the strongest shinobi to shame. Although Kyuubi is young, her powers were feared even then. Yet sadly, not only can she not use her full power, she doesn't remember she ever had a Heart to begin with.</p><p>"I cannot say any more than that because it is not my place to unveil other's secrets without their knowledge. I have told you all that is mine to tell and nothing more." Naruto took what Enra said to heart and pondered on it. <i>Could it be possible that she's </i>that<i> powerful? Even I can't believe that.</i></p><p>Enra yawned and stood up. "This story seems to have put a touch of misery in the air. Maybe it's best to change the subject to something more beneficial." His body changed to smoke and rushed at Naruto catching him off guard. The smoke cloud hit Naruto just above the chest and threw Naruto on his back from the force of the impact. Naruto shook his head of the surprise and jumped to his feet. "Enra what the hell was that about?" He shouted and looked around and in his rage he couldn't see him.</p><p>"<i>Relax boy, I know it was a bit much but I needed to surprise you."</i> Enra's voice whispered in his thoughts. "Enra? Where are you?" Naruto asked looking around again not getting the hint. <i>"It's it obvious? I'm in your head. Well, actually I think possessing you is more accurate."</i></p><p>"Possessing me?" Naruto's body started to move of its own accord. It stood up and walked over to the clone near the ayakashi's head. <i>"That's right. The moderate way of teaching may not give us enough time to train you properly. I'm going to teach you how demon sages wield their powers, but in a way that's different to what you may be used to. For starters, I'll teach you how the sages obtained their powers from demons and how they used it properly.</i></p><p>"<i>There are three types of demonic beings that exist which can give power to humans: physical, spiritual, and archaic. Physical demons are the weakest of the three and only rely on brute strength to win their battles. Spiritual ones, like me, can possess humans and control them to an extent and are more common than most. Archaic demons are the most powerful of us all and are the rarest to find. We on the other hand are lucky enough to have found one."</i></p><p>"Found one? You mean the ayakashi?" Naruto asked looking down at the serpent. <i>"That right. Ayakashi are classified as archaic for their strength and their scales. Back in the day, if a demon sage was to happen across one, their power would be a great advantage in battle. While acquiring it is one thing, mastering it is another thing entirely."</i> Enra had Naruto's body near the ayakashi's mouth, where he proceeded to take out a kunai and, after a bit of waiting, the ayakashi opened up and the arm in which said kunai was held, was jammed between two teeth.</p><p>After some thrashing, and some screaming, Enra had Naruto back on top of its head freaked out. "Was there a point to any of what you just did?" He groaned. <i>"I'm starting to find it difficult to see why she hasn't torn you a new one yet. Look at the kunai." </i>Naruto watched as Enra used his arm to raise the weapon and saw a blue liquid dropping off the blade. "What is this stuff, blood? What do I do with this?" Before he knew what happened, Naruto's mouth opened and wiped the kunai on his tongue, allowing the blood to slide off and swallowed, all Enra's doing.</p><p>Naruto began to cough and gag on the blood as it went down his throat. "What the hell! It burns like I swallowed magma." He shouted grabbing his throat. <i>"It is how they gain their powers, by taking in some of the demon's essence and ingesting it into the body. Your body will need time to adapt to it but once it does it will be worth the trouble,"</i> Enra explained.</p><p>"<i>For the time being I'll explain the next part on their art forms and battling styles. For the most part a demon sage's real power doesn't come from the demons, but from using their strengths to the best potential in any given combat situation. The justu performed by the sages of old were managed by using demonic chakra and their art forms were done by using the demon's powers in tandem with the sage's own body. It's similar to when you used Kyuubi's chakra, but with more technique. By comparing the two chakras in your body we can find training that best suits you." </i>Naruto stopped coughing and rubbed his throat.</p><p>"<i>Try seeing it this way: as you already know, Kyuubi's chakra is much more powerful than your own but when you tap into any large amount of it you lose all sense of control. We will call this the force chakra. Then you have your normal chakra, you have great control over it but it doesn't rival Kyuubi's power, though your chakra reserves rival Kyuubi's in quantity. This will be the control chakra. What is your most powerful justu you can use multiple times in your natural state?"</i></p><p>"That one's easy, it's my Rasengan." Naruto exclaimed with pride. <i>"Good, we have a starting point. Now tell me how this justu works, everything you can."</i> Naruto told Enra about it in detail from form to function, how long it took him to master it and the effects it had when used. <i>"Interesting…can you perform it, right now?" </i>Enra said.</p><p>Naruto put a hand on the seal on his stomach. "Yunika told me it was best not to take that chance because of the cracking seal inside her cage. She said something like the Rasengan is a last resort move for now. I might be able to use Vampire Judgment first to get the chakra I need, but for that justu I'll need a different source of chakra and I won't bite the ayakashi." He said and shuddered at the memory.</p><p>Enra's voice changed from curiosity to disappointment. <i>"Oh, I see. Well, at least I can give you some insight on the control and force chakras. When you use your Rasengan with your normal chakra, you take it and condense it which takes up all of your focus and control over that vast power, similar to when you turn on a hose and stick your thumb over the end you increase the pressure and in turn you increase the power.</i></p><p>"<i>Using Kyuubi's chakra is different in that regard. If your chakra is like water coming out of a hose, then her chakra is like a grand waterfall. It has much more power and is nearly impossible for someone of your skill level to control it. Every time you try, you get the raw power it holds but without proper focus you can't take it to the next level. After all, you can't put an entire waterfall into a hose."</i></p><p>"No offense but what does this have to do with training?" Naruto asked impatiently. <i>"You will understand soon enough. For now while we have the time given to us, I'm going to teach you how to use demonic art forms using my power. Enter your mindscape and have your clone notify us of anything going on in the real world." </i>He told Naruto and went quiet. Naruto groaned again and did as he was told. Naruto found Enra standing in front of the cage doors, looking in on his old friend. Yunika had reverted back to her bestial form and was sleeping peacefully.</p><p>Enra placed a hand on the cell in a sympathetic manner, "Ah my dear friend, how the years have passed and here you are. Time has not been kind to you, not since you saved me…" He whispered. Her giant vulpine form stirred a little but continued to slumber. He removed his hand and turned to Naruto with a look of grievance. "Are you going to be okay?" Naruto asked concerned with Enra seeing his savoir behind bars.</p><p>Yunika slowly opened one vermillion eye to see what they were talking about already knowing who it was that woke her from her sleep. "Yes, I'll be fine. It's just seeing her like this…I wish I could free her from this imprisonment. I know what she did to your home but even she doesn't deserve this." He replied quietly. Yunika's eye moved from Enra to Naruto and saw him stretch and rub the back of his head again.</p><p>"Look, I know it isn't my place to say but the past is the past. We can't change it no matter how hard we try. I can't vouch for her kindness in the time I've known her or her "trusting" nature, the way she beats around the whole damn forest to get anything done, and on top of that a good amount of my memories are locked away behind that seal she made. So far all I can say about her is she's manipulative, has a dark sense of humor, cares only about herself, AND hates every human in the world. Add that to everything I've learned about her, it seems that she was meant to stay locked up." He said blatantly.</p><p>Yunika lowered her gaze with a feeling of loathing and she took a breath to speak her thoughts. "But,"</p><p>She stopped and her eye looked back up in surprise at Naruto who spoke. He was looking over at the seal on the cage, not seeing she was awake. "There were moments where she showed a more human side. Each time she did she surprised me with something new. What amazed me most was when she transformed into her human form." Enra gave him his head-cocked-to-the-side look. "Oh? And how did she look?" He asked.</p><p>Naruto walked slowly towards the doors, his eyes fixed on her, unaware that she was awake. "There's no other way to say it, she was beautiful. When she was harassing me, she had a certain style that made it work. I can't put it into words really but, it feels like we work well with each other." He said softly. Yunika didn't move a muscle, not to continue the ruse but out of shock. She never heard someone speak of her in such kind regard.</p><p>Enra laughed, "That's the Kyuubi I remember. Even if she wears a mask she hasn't changed. But enough of nostalgia," He walked up to Naruto and put a hand on his shoulder. "Before we start there are two cardinal rules the demon sages must always obey: do not fight a demon you cannot conquer and do not use a demon's power if you don't carry a demon's spirit."</p><p>He put his other hand up to stop Naruto when he opened his mouth. "If you fight a demon too strong you will lose your life in the attempt. Those who use their power without a demonic host will become a demon themselves. If Yunika somehow ever gets taken away from you, should it come to pass, do not try to use any power Hell-forged in nature."</p><p>Enra removed his hand and bowed. "Now that we've gotten that out of the way, shall we get started?" He said with a snarky grin looking up. Naruto grinned in return, "Finally, yes." Enra leaped back and took a stance, placing his left leg forward and both arms out palms facing Naruto like he was pushing a heavy object. "In my experience, I find the best way to learn is in the field and this way we can do it in secret. I'm going to teach you how to learn on the fly, to be aware of everything around you and understand it and react accordingly. This is where we will begin. You will fight me and you will learn." His words had a stern tone that made Naruto excited in the anticipation of battle.</p><p>Naruto pulled out a kunai and readied himself, a wild grin spreading over his face. "Alright, you're on. I've done nothing but run around like a dog without its master. It's about damn time I got some real training in!" And with a yell he charged at Enra with all he had as Yunika watched in silence.</p><p><b>A/N:</b> So what'd you all think of this one?</p><p>I borrowed the mirror world idea from one of my favorite games and I planned on using the memory and souls as tangible objects of power, anyone who knows the classical version of the kitsune might know where I'm going with the sacred Hearts idea. I didn't have much of a theory for how to place demons as a form of rank so I went with a simpler option and decided to go for an umbrella term rather than attempt to specify absolutely everything.</p><p>I plan on using some the force and control chakra ideas to get inventive with some old and new justu, so if anyone cares to give their two cents I say get creative. Due credit will be given as always if used in the story.</p><p>Next chapter, Naruto works past island security, meets two interesting kids along the way, a 'relative' comes into play, and we'll get to see the first good fight scene of the story. Until then, you know what to do. R&R folks!</p><p>P.S. By the time this chapter is up the next one will have been done so I will wait for the reviews to roll in before I upload it.</p>
