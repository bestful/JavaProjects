<div style='color:gray;'>Rated: <a href='http://www.fictionratings.com/' target='rating'>Fiction  M</a> - English - Adventure/Romance -  Naruto U. & Kurama/Kyuubi  - Words: 728 - Reviews: <a href='/r/7727139/'>12</a> - Favs: 3 - Follows: 5 - Published: 01-09-127727139 </div></h2><br><br><h3>Chapter 1</h3><hr><p><b>The Shattered Kitsune</b><br><b><br>Disclaimer:I own nothing in this about Naruto except jutsu and etc. I may make on my own<br></b><b><br>READ IT!</b></p><p>(My story won't be a wall of text like this later on when I actually start writing the story just saying)<br><i><br></i>First some background on this story and how my writing will be, and that's also why the first chapter is called introduction. My frequency with writing is actually dependent on you, meaning I am only publishing a chapter when the previous one has at least one review. For all of you who find this unfair think like me, would you like to write to nobody? Exactly, I will work on a new chapter each time one gets a new review, they won't be little tiny ones. I'm aiming to at least break 1000 words each one, excluding the disclaimer and AN of course. This story will have probably quite a lot of polls, the reason being I want to try to please the people with this story as much as possible. So this story is about a half kitsune demon Naruto but then later he changes to something very quite similar, but in my opinion better. I'm not gonna say though so sorry about that, I just don't wanna ruin the surprise! This Naruto will defect from the hidden village probably at a young age, and at the latest before team assigning. If you dislike this don't worry he will possibly return later, he won't be a happy camper though so keep that in mind. This will probably be a Naruto with one other pairing or two possibly depending on polls. I would say harem but I'll save that for a different story, and personally I like harem stories but writing one seems hectic. Polls will be at the bottom of the story, and you can answer either through pm or review. There might be some bashing in this story on quite some people, maybe not much because it really gets repetitive. And repetitive doesn't make a good story in my opinion, if it does to you that's your opinion. Yes this will probably be a very strong powered Naruto and you know why? Cause I like a bad ass strong Naruto! I don't think I'm going to make him some village leveling god level ninja, just a very high powered rogue ninja. For pairing lets just stick with no yaoi for this one at least, I don't mind yaoi but yaoi/adventure? I just don't see that happening people sorry, maybe in the future if I'm convinced I'll give it a chance. This will probably be a graphic dark story with a dark Naruto, there might be a light in the future with it depending on you guessed it polls. Summoning is probably a yes in case you were wondering, I'll probably put together a poll for that maybe. This will also be a story where Naruto is in fact abused emotionally/mentally, and becomes cold. Him and Kyuubi will be close friends and maybe lovers, but if you decide against it I'll just make Kyuubi male. Kyuubi will be the only person he will talk to let alone talk to, but just for the first few chapters don't worry. Lemons well I personally like them but I have never written one, I'll attempt to if you want, and maybe someone can help? I think this is all if I left something out I'll get to it later, I'm going to try to get the first real chapter up tomorrow sorry everyone. Just you know my head needs rest so I can pull more ideas out of it. That's all for now good night my fellow fanfiction and anime lovers.</p><p>And on a side note I know this is under 1000 words, but it's only cause its the introductory to me my writing and this story. I stay true to my word and you will all get your 1000 word chapters as long as you take the time to review. But actually try to give a actual review it would be appreciated, even flames as long as they make sense.</p><p><b>POLL<br>Female Kyuubi – Lovers<br>or<br>Male Kyuubi – Friends</b></p>
