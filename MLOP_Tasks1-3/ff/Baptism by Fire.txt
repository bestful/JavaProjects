To much pressure from fame and fortune...</p><p>Personal note: There will be some changes to age and everything. I am aware of this and these are pruposeful</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>He watched the children, though they really couldn't be called children anymore, seeing as how shinobi were seen as adults in the eyes of the village, exiting the academy building, running to excited parents and siblings about their promotions. The swing rocked back and forth gently, oblivious to its occupant's anger and frustration. The dirt beneath the swing he rested upon began to show a furrow from the movement of his shoe. Grumbling something incoherent, he ignored the heated glares and whispered remarks from those who were there to pick up fresh graduates. Some criticized him for even attempting to take the exam, while others wore smirks at the boy's failure. A few laughed at the fact that a boy of sixteen had been unable to do what twelve year old children had found so easy. Life could be so cruel sometimes.</p><p>The blond left the swing set and made to return home. This was his third time that he had failed the test to become an official shinobi of Konohagakure, the Village Hidden in the Leaves. While most children succeeded in their first attempt, he had the unfortunate pleasure of being unable to perform the simplest of techniques for three years. He sighed while he thought of his abilities. His martial prowess in taijutsu consisted of attempting to throw wild haymakers while hoping that any opponent would be blind enough to be hit by such sloppy and obvious attacks. His skill in ninjutsu was abysmal, only understanding the Kawarimi at an operable level. The Bunshin no jutsu, the easiest of all clone techniques, eluded his grasp no matter how hard he tried. Academy students were expected to be able to create three clones which looked exactly like their creator. He couldn't even create one workable clone, let alone multiple. The last aspect of the shinobi repertoire, genjutsu, was non existent. His Henge jutsus were always missing key features of the target, such as his instructor's distinct scar.</p><p>He kicked a stone in his path, watching it sail forward a few feet. It was not for a lack of trying that he couldn't perform up to par. His first and second years the instructor had simply ignored all of his cries for help and had deliberately made things more difficult, pairing him with the best in class despite the fact that he was the worst. When he needed help studying for a test, or when he wanted a partner for practice, he was ignored by all of the other students. Even though the third year instructor, Iruka, had not attempted to sabotage his learning, the damage that had been dealt was sufficient to forever stunt his growth. He had sworn that if he failed his third test, he would give up being a shinobi forever, and his last test resulted in the same as his previous.</p><p>"Naruto!"a voice called out. The boy turned upon hearing his name and saw the assistant instructor Mizuki calling him. He had been one of the people watching his exam. The man put a hand on the boy's shoulder, an easy feat given the boy's uncharacteristic shortness, and gave a sincere smile to the boy who was almost a young man. "How are you doing, Naruto? I'm sorry about the test." The boy stared down at the dirt, the emotions from his failure still running high. The white-haired man was obviously just trying to comfort him. "Iruka and I talked about it afterwards, and though I tried to let you pass, he was against sending you out if you were unprepared." Naruto felt his hands ball into fists at the thought. He was perfectly capable of surviving without the stupid jutsu. He would have found a way. Taking a deep breath, he released it and felt some of the tension leave his body. That sad smile that he gave to most of the people in the village appeared, and he showed it to the instructor.</p><p>"Thank you very much for the concern, Mizuki-sensei," he said cheerily, though anyone could hear the strain of emotion behind it. Light from the setting sun reflected off of the metal plate on the headband around the older man's forehead, and the rest of the words Naruto had to say caught themselves in his throat. As hard as he had tried, tears welled in the corners of his eyes. He sniffled as he wiped them away. Cursing all of his weaknesses, the boy began walking away from his instructor, disappointment fatiguing him. However, the hand on his shoulder did not budge and the white-haired man smiled at his young charge. "Mizuki-sensei?"</p><p>Mizuki led Naruto back toward the academy building, sitting them both on the swing set he had just vacated. "Now, Naruto, I wouldn't just have randomly brought up the test. I know that you are hurting and that you desperately want to become a ninja. Like I said, I talked with Iruka and he and I agreed that you didn't show the skills needed to become a genin." The blond flinched. "But, that doesn't mean you don't have some skills." Naruto perked up upon hearing what Mizuki was telling him. "It won't be easy, but there is a secondary test that students can take to advance past the academy. It was replaced with the current test at the end of the Third Shinobi World War. However, it is still a true test. No others may help you with it, and it is by far more difficult than the test you tried taking today. Do you think you can do it?"</p><p>Naruto had small tremors running across his body. The chance to fulfill his dream was still in front of him, and he had a second chance. Just as he was about to give his answer, he felt a buzzing in the back of his head. The buzzing grew and grew, until it eventually burst into a roar. Pain flooded through him. It felt as though his head was splitting open. He cried out as he convulsed on the ground, grasping at his head and trying anything he could to relieve the pain. He opened his eyes just enough to see Mizuki crouched over him, but he couldn't hear anything the man was saying. The pain increased by leaps and bounds as he lay there on the ground. When he thought it couldn't get any worse, he heard a strange sound coming from the back of his mind. He could barely make out anything when a voice rang out clear as day.</p><p>"Don't!"</p><p>His vision went red for the brief second that he heard the voice, and he saw Mizuki gasp and back away, his hand reaching for a pouch on his hip. Then, as suddenly as the pain had appeared, it vanished. Naruto blinked away a few tears and sat up, phantom pains still giving him convulsions. The buzzing was gone now, but he felt a peculiar emptiness inside of his mind.</p><p>The instructor still stood a ways away, but began checking on him as soon as the boy stood. "Are you okay, Naruto? That was pretty scary there." Naruto nodded and remembered what the voice had said. It was definitely female, and the desperation had been evident. He had also detected something else... anger? While he wasn't the sort to just listen to voices that appeared in his head, something told him to trust this one. As he opened his mouth to tell his sensei what had happened, he realized how absurd it would sound for him to talk about voices in his head. Mizuki might think he had psychological problems and rescind his make-up test. He gave a small smile to the older man and scratched the back of his head innocently.</p><p>"Sorry, Mizuki-sensei. I get these really bad headaches occasionally. I wish you hadn't seen that," Naruto said as he managed to look sheepish. Mizuki still had a questioning look on his face, but bought the excuse for the time being. Naruto brushed the dust and dirt off of his faded black pants and light grey shirt. They both sat in silence for a minute, wondering what had just occurred.</p><p>"So, about the test. Are you willing to try it?" Mizuki gave what looked like a heart-felt smile, but after the incident in his head, Naruto examined the man's face. Something was off here. The boy thought for a second and, still wondering if he should trust what the voice had said, followed his gut instinct.</p><p>"I'm sorry, Mizuki-sensei, but I don't think I can take another failure right now. Thank you for the offer, but I'll just try again next year." Mizuki let a flash of anger slip through his features, and Naruto was sure that he had made the correct choice. A smile quickly appeared back on the instructor's face, but this one did not reach his eyes. He stood and dusted himself off before patting the blond on the back.</p><p>"I wish you would at least try, but I understand why you wouldn't want to. If you change your mind, let me know. You have until midnight tonight to make a final decision." With that, Naruto hopped off of the swing and followed the same path he had before, missing the scornful look sent at his back as he walked away. Mumbling under his breath, the chuunin sensei returned to his duties within the academy building. He had a long night ahead of him.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Inside of a run-down apartment, Naruto tossed and turned in his sleep. A strange dream occupied his unconscious mind. He was floated in a vast nothingness, listlessly floating in the dark that carried his weightless form. Despite the void, a feeling of peace settled itself around him. He felt that nothing here would insult or attack him. It was a pleasant change from the waking world.</p><p>In the corner of his eye, he noticed a red light far away. As he turned to watch it, he noticed it growing larger and larger. He felt a presence that grew closer as the light grew larger. The presence touched at his mind. While strange and alien, it was also comforting. He sensed affection from the presence, and he allowed it to make contact with him. A figure appeared within the light; a woman bathed in red floated down from above him. She wore nothing on her person, but her flowing scarlet hair covered much of her body. Her features were hidden from him. He tried to catch a glimpse of her eyes and earned a soft smile for his efforts. She grasped onto him, pulling him into a close hug as she did. He felt warmth, calm, and something else radiating from her, but he could not place the last feeling.</p><p>The woman ran a hand through Naruto's hair, petting him softly as she simply held him. He remained rigid in her hold for several moments. The peace of mind that her presence gave him was something that he had never experienced before. When the he sensed sadness coming from the woman, he returned her affection, grabbing her tightly in his arms. Happiness flooded from the woman, bringing about more warmth from her. A smile teased its way onto his face as the two sat in the silence of the darkness. Finally, the woman pushed him away from her, holding him at arms length as her smile was replaced with a far more serious look. He felt the overwhelming pain again and found his cries silent as he tried to stop the agony. She brought him close to her person once more and he found that the pain eased itself, if only slightly. Much like before, he heard a sound, only this time it was much more forceful.</p><p>"Leave." It was the same voice as before, only this time it was much more clear. After he heard the word, the pain disappeared. He looked at the woman and attempted to ask if she was the one speaking, but found he could not make a sound. Making gestures with his hands, Naruto managed to communicate with her and asked if the woman was the one talking. She nodded in affirmation, and he felt a brief spike of pain. "You," the voice said again. There was a brief pause. "Danger." With each message, the pain was getting more and more bearable. He tried to ask her what she was referring to, but the mysterious woman looked in a direction away from him. The young man noticed two very long ears, much like a cat or a fox, on top of her head twitching as if locating the source of a noise. He himself heard nothing, but the look of worry on his visitor's face was a cause for concern.</p><p>Suddenly, the woman shoved him away. He felt himself falling and vainly reached out to her. She smiled sadly as she gave a small wave as he continued his descent. Naruto called out to her, forgetting that no sound would escape him. He fell faster and faster as the woman and the red light grew farther and farther away.</p><p>With a jolt, Naruto hit the ground beside his bed. He groaned, rubbing his shoulder from its sudden acquaintance with the floor. His head was foggy, and he shook it to clear his mind. Remembering the dream, he quickly stood and went over everything that he had been told. The woman had seemed determined to get him to leave, but leave where? Did she want him to leave his home, or did she have something much bigger in mind. He looked at the clock on his bedside table. The florescent lights read that it was a quarter after four in the morning. Though it was rather early for him, a nice long shower and some breakfast might be just the thing he needed to sort everything out.</p><p>But as he was about to enter his bathroom, he heard a loud knocking coming from the front door. He was cautious to answer, as generally anyone who was up this early in the morning and wanted him did not have the best intentions. Slowly he opened the door just an inch. As he did so, something collided with it and forced it open the rest of the way, breaking the latch designed to prevent just such an occurrence. Naruto stumbled backward as he saw a figure clothed in the standard attire of a shinobi of Konoha. He tried to rub the sleep out of his eyes, but a strong hand grabbed his arm. His mind now working at full speed, he noticed the white hair and bandana on his assailant. However, instead of the cheerful and gentle expression that he was used to seeing on his Mizuki, now there was only one of pure hatred and disgust. Fear took over for the young man. Such a look was common for him to see, and it usually only promised one thing: pain.</p><p>The chuunin hoisted the blond up, never letting go of the tight grip on the younger man's arm. He sneered as he jerked the boy forward, forcing him to stumble. A bitter laugh escaped the instructor's throat as he watched the look of confusion and fear on his former student. From the pack on his shoulder he pulled out a large scroll, one which Naruto recognized as the Forbidden Scroll which contained the strongest and most secretive of jutsu and techniques. He didn't understand why Mizuki had the scroll. It was restricted to only jounin level or higher nin, and even they needed special permission from the leader of the village, the Hokage.</p><p>The white-haired man slammed Naruto into the wall, pulling out a kunai knife and holding it against his throat. "Now listen closely brat. You're going to sit there nice and quiet while I do this. If you so much as move a muscle or make a sound, you'll soon find out just how sharp a real one of these is." He pressed the blade just close enough to draw a thin red line across the boy's neck. "Understand?" The young man nodded slowly. He removed the kunai from the boy's throat and turned toward the scroll, pulling a smaller one and an inkwell with a brush from his pack. Then he began to copy the jutsu onto the empty scroll. As he did so, Naruto slumped down to the ground, the sudden reversal in his sensei's demeanor shocking and painful. He sat there for a minute before he finally found his voice.</p><p>"Why, Mizuki-sensei? Why are you doing this?" Though he already could guess the answer, he wanted to hear it from the man who he had only a little while ago been conversing with. The chuunin did not look up from his work, but a sneer crossed his face. He flung the kunai in his hand, embedding it a few inches into the boards of the wall beside Naruto's head. The blond flinched involuntarily, but a thousand thoughts flew threw his head. He needed to find an escape route. His sensei had been foolish enough to lend him a weapon he could use, and if he timed it right he might just be able to flee with only minor injuries.</p><p>When the man turned to look at a seal more closely, Naruto sprung into action. He grabbed the handle of the knife and pulled hard, successfully managing to pull it out of the wall. Mizuki looked up at the commotion and was caught off guard by the charging, screaming young man, who bowled over him and sent ink, weapons, and both men sprawling on the floor. Naruto quickly got up and made a dash for the floor, but screamed as he felt something bite into his ankle. He fell to the ground, smashing his face into the floorboards. He felt the crunch as cartilage snapped and blood flowed from the now broken nose. His hands reached for his foot and felt the sharpened points of a shuriken imbedded into his Achilles' heel.</p><p>Mizuki looked at the ruined duplicate scroll, covered in the ink that had been spilled. He glared daggers at the younger man. Blood oozed from the wound on his arm from the kunai. A second one appeared in his hand. He straddled the boy, pulling his head up by the hair and holding the tip of the knife against one azure eye. "Did you think I was fucking around, boy?" The tip came closer and closer to his pupil. "If you thought I was going to allow you to live after witnessing this, you surely won't live through this." Mizuki jabbed the kunai into Naruto's shoulder, twisting it to inflict maximum damage. "Do you enjoy that, you little demon? Do you enjoy the pain and suffering? I shall inflict upon you what you have inflicted upon this whole village! They will remember my name as the man who brought the demon to justice; the demon who stole the villages' most guarded secrets!"</p><p>Naruto screamed from the pain, confused as to just what exactly the man was talking about. What demon? What had he done? His attacker noticed his confusion and a dark smile spread across his features. "You don't even know what I'm talking about, do you?" Naruto did his best not to say anything, but another twist of the knife brought out another scream. "Do you know the story of the Kyuubi no Kitsune, who assaulted this village sixteen years ago? It attacked on October 10th, which just so happens to be your birthday. Do you see the coincidence?"</p><p>Realization flooded Naruto. He understood the looks of disgust, dread, and fear he got every time he went somewhere public. He was the Kyuubi. He was the demon that had ruined everyone's lives and had killed so many, including the Yondaime Hokage, the hero of the village. Tears welled in his eyes, both from pain and sadness. Mizuki laughed, a terrible, hollow sound that filled the small apartment. "Yes, suffer! Suffer from the knowledge that everything is your fault, Naruto. Everything!"</p><p>Maybe it would be best to just die here, he thought. There was no one who would care for him, and he caused misery wherever he went. Maybe death was the answer that he had been searching for. Maybe death could set him free.</p><p>Just as he thought that, the pain in his head returned, stronger and faster than ever. He tried to scream, but his throat was raw. Mizuki believed it to be his doing and continued to laugh and torment the boy, this time stabbing into his thigh, widening the wound. Suddenly, the pain evaporated. Naruto felt a dam burst in his mind, and a soothing presence entered his mind. It was the same person from his dream.</p><p>"I will protect you, Naruto."</p><p>Power erupted in his body, encasing him in a glowing red sphere. His eye's rolled back into his head as he was lifted off the ground, knocking a shocked Mizuki to the ground. Before the white-haired man, the boy's wounds recovered almost instantly. His nose reset itself, and the whisker marks on his cheeks deepened and thickened. His hair grew out, the bangs reaching down past his forehead. Instead of the bright yellow it had been, it darkened until it was crimson. His nails sharpened to claws, and his body grew until it was several inches taller than Mizuki was. Muscles bulged and expanded until stopping at a size right for someone who was four or five years Naruto's elder. The chuunin could not help but stare at the spectacle before him.</p><p>When the transformation was finished, the red glow diminished but did not disappear entirely. The young man was set gently on the ground, his eyes closed and a look of peace on his face. The white haired assailant gripped the kunai in both hands, ready for any unexpected movement. When none came, he crept closer to the boy. When he was in range, he delivered a killing blow directly to the heart. But as the knife descended, the boy-turned-man's hand grabbed Mizuki's wrist, stopping the blade not an inch from his chest. Naruto's eyes shot open, revealing the once deep blue orbs had turned the same menacing red as his hair. A snarl appeared on his lips. Dozens of pointed fangs reflected the red aura around him. Were it not for the color differences, Mizuki would have sworn that he was looking at the Fourth Hokage.</p><p>The hand around his wrist tightened, and he felt more than a few bones snap under the pressure. Trying as hard as he could to free himself, Mizuki could only watch helplessly as the bones in his wrist were ground to a pulp by the immense grip being applied to it. It was everything he could do not to scream in pain. Naruto rose to his feet, never releasing his captive. When he spoke, it was not the light voice of the boy he knew, but a feminine voice that he heard. There was a bestial undertone to it, as though it was more animal than human.</p><p>"You have hurt him," the woman spoke, the sound odd coming from Naruto's body. Mizuki grimaced and tried again to pull his hand free. He reached for another kunai, but as he did so Naruto's eyes narrowed and the chuunin felt his hand begin to burn. This time, he really did scream as he watched his left hand shrivel and blister as though it was being held over an open flame. Finally, after what seemed to be an eternity, the nerve endings in his hand had burnt to a crisp and the pain stopped.</p><p>Naruto still had not released the left hand, however, and it was with that grip that he tossed Mizuki into a wall. While the strength to perform such an action would have been admirable in its own right, the hole that the man-turned-missle left behind was even more impressive. He followed his assailant out onto the street three stories down where he lay collapsed on the ground writhing in pain. The red aura around him flashed and he levitated, gliding down from the building in a much more graceful fashion than Mizuki. The boy's face was impassive as he landed. The man on the ground sobbed as his body was wracked with spasms from pain.</p><p>The chuunin tried to make some sense of what was going on. A boy had just turned from a sniveling wreck into a monstrous force. The pressure coming from the demon carrier was massive, pushing against the man as easily as if the boy himself was doing it. It was illogical for Naruto to actually be this powerful. What had granted him such a startling change.</p><p>Recognition dawned in his eyes as he looked up at the demon staring down at him. "You're the Kyuubi," he mumbled. The faint traces of a smile twitched at the corners of his mouth, but that smile never reached his cold eyes. Naruto – but was it really Naruto? - reached down and grabbed Mizuki by the throat, lifting him off the ground with little resistance. The man grabbed and tried to find a way to break the grip, but the hand was a vice. He was forced to stare down into those eyes again, eyes colored the same red as the blood that he knew would soon be spilled.</p><p>Naruto spoke, and again the feminine voice emerged. "You have harmed Naruto, whom has done nothing to you and never wished anything more than your acceptance." The hand around his throat squeezed. "There is only one punishment suitable for a pathetic excuse for a human such as you." Beneath the two of them, a small hole began to appear. It's edges glowed with the force of the ethereal magic being cast. Within, Mizuki could see the glow of fire and the howls and screams of those who had been damned there. He struggled harder to break free.</p><p>"There is a special place in Hell waiting for you, and as its queen, it is my duty to send you there." Naruto brought him closer to his face, so that he could see the full malice behind the crimson eyes. "Be damned and forgotten."</p><p>With those final words, the boy let go of his once-instructor. His screams echoed into the night. As quickly as the pit had appeared, it was replaced by solid ground. Naruto turned toward a sound, his ears turning slightly as a fox's would. Hearing the alarmed cries of those who had heard the screaming, he jumped high into the air, landing on the apartment complex's roof. From there, he made his way toward the walls of the village, staying on the rooftops and traveling at speeds that only a select few would have been able to follow. The guards would report that they had seen a crimson blur and a familiar face appear for only a slight second before passing by them.</p><p>In a small clearing far from the village he had once called home, the boy finally stopped running. Despite the hard pace, he was barely winded from the journey. He giggled to himself, a sound reminiscent of wind chimes. As he sat beneath an old oak, he stared at the moon as it began its ascent. He smiled, something both feral and calming in the expression. As he closed his eyes to sleep, the woman's voice escaped his lips again.</p><p>"You are finally safe, Naruto."</p>
