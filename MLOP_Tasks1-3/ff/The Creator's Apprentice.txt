On this day the leaf village throws a festival I honor of the fourth.</P><P>Everyone is celebrating except one, Naruto Uzumaki. Many say he is a demon in disguise, the nine tails to be precise.</P><P>Only a select few know what really happened that day, but that is a story fo another time.</P><P>We now see the young uzumaki running from a mob of villagers. 'why!?' thought naruto. 'Why do they keep chasing me when I didn't do anything!?'</P><P>He ran into a dark ally and thought he could get out on the other side until he hit a wall 'No, it's a dead end!' he thought.</P><P>Naruto turned around to see the mob pass by until one civilian pointed at him "There's the demon!" Then a couple chunin came up, grabbed his arms, and stuck to them to the wall with kunai.</P><P>AGGG! Screamed naruto. Then they grabbed some cloth and shoved it in his mouth. "Don't want anyone to hear you now do we?" said a chunin smirking evily. The other chunin went threw hand signs and said <B>lightning style: lightning pulse!</B> and slammed his hand into naruto's gut.</P><P>Naruto screamed through his gag in pain as high pulses of lightning shot threw his body. Then they ripped of his shirt and carved demon on his chest and arms with kunai.</P><P>The chunin stepped back when they saw a tiger masked ANBU coming. He pulled his sword out and stabbed naruto in the gut. MGHH! Screamed naruto when the anbu stabbed him.</P><P>Then the ANBU jumped back as a figure appeared. He was wearing a black cloak with crimson leaves moving on it like they were floating in the wind. " Torturing some defenseless child about false accusations, how konoha has fallen" spoke the figure.</P><P>Faster than the ANBU could react he appeared in front of him with his first two fingers on his mask and said<B> "shatter". </B>Then the ANBU shattered into pieces with blood splashing everywhere.</P><P>Then the leaves on his coat and some black ones that couldn't be seen came off and formed a sword. It was a katana that was 36 in. long from hilt to the tip of the blade. Then naruto saw him disappear and then reappear in the same spot.</P><P>Naruto saw everyone explode in a shower of blood as there bodies fell apart from being severed. The figure turned and said "Everything will be fine. I'm going to take you to the hospital." With that naruto passed out from blood loss.</P><P><U>MINDSCAPE</U></P><P>Naruto woke up and looked around to notice that he was in a sewer. "So much for taking me to the hospital. Might as well look around" and he started to walk forward.</P><P>He walked for what seemed like 30 minutes until he found himself in a room with a cage in front of him. He notices there was a piece of paper on it that had the kanji for 'seal'.</P><P>He heard something but couldn't make it out so he did what a weasel masked ANBU said, and focused chakra to his ears. He then made it out to be crying and figured it was coming from the cage and decided to find out who was crying.</P><P>He slipped through the bars and walked closer to where the sound was coming from. He saw a girl who looked about 16 with her face in her knees crying and mumbling <B>"I'm sorry"</B> over and over.</P><P>"Hey why are you crying, and what are you sorry for?" asked naruto. <B>"For making the villagers hate you"</B> she said and stood up and he took in her beauty.</P><P>She was a DD-cup in breast size and had a nice small round ass. She had crimson colored hair with black highlights that reached mid back. She had white skin with no blemishes.</P><P>She wore a crimson kimono with a gold obi and gold foxes running around the kimono that went to the top of her knees, and no shoes. She had a heart-shaped face with red lipstick and red slited eyes.</P><P>The most noticeable thing was the nine red and white tipped tails swaying behind her. She sniffled and smiled<B> "Are you done checking me out?"</B></P><P>Naruto blushed and stuttered "Y-yes, I mean N-no! Wait! Uhhh…" Kyuubi giggled <B>"I know I was just teasing. By the way I'm the Kyuubi no yoko."</B></P><P>Naruto looked confused "I thought the fourth hokage killed the Kyuubi?" Kyuubi shook her head <B>" I am a being made of pure chakra nothing can kill me, only sealed.</B> <B>He knew this and sealed me into a new born baby, you. </B></P><P><B>Now I would like to know how you got here and why you act so mature for a five year old. I only look like one because I age with you</B>.<B>"</B></P><P>Naruto cleared his throat and spoke "Well I'm so mature because I grew up my myself so I had to grow up quickly. I don't really know why I am here"</P><P>Kyuubi nodded "<B>Ok, what happened before you appeared here?"</B> Naruto make a thinking face then looked back at her.</P><P>"Well I was being beat up my a mob at the time. Soon some chunin came and started to torture me. Then a ANBU came and stabbed me in the stomach." Kyuubi growled at this then motioned for him to continue.</P><P>Before he could do it again a figure in a black cloak with crimson leaves that seemed to move appeared and stopped him. Then he killed everyone and told me he would take me to the hospital, but instead put me in a sewer."</P><P>"<B>Well first this is your mindscape that hold me. Second can you fix this to something different than a sewer?"</B> said kyuubi. Naruto tilted his head to the side "How do I do that?"</P><P>Kyuubi mentally screamed <I><B>'kawai' </B></I>at how cute he looked<B>. "Well it's your mind just think of it and it should happen."</B> Naruto nodded, closed his eyes then everything started to glow and kyuubi closed her eyes.</P><P>When she opened them she gasped. They were in a clearing, under a huge sakura tree but the petals were crimson. There was tree line to the left of her a medium sized lake with a waterfall emptying into it from a tall cliff.</P><P>To her right there was a two story traditional Japanese house with water surrounding it and a bridge going over it. Behind her there was a Zen garden bamboo surrounding the back of it.</P><P>Also there was little foxes running around them. Kyuubi tackled naruto to the ground <B>"Thank you so much!"</B> Naruto hugged her back and said "Your welcome, Kyuubi." She got up and said <B>"My name is hitome"</B> Naruto nodded "Ok, hitome it is."</P><P>"Is there anyway to speak to you other than in my mindscape?" asked naruto. Kyuubi pointed to the seal <B>"Just tear off 1/3 of it and we can talk telepathically. Also your chakra supply, which is already at chunin, will increase to high jonin, and it will become more potent and require less of it to perform jutsu.</B></P><P><B>My chakra will flood your system and you will become faster, stronger, more mature than you already are. Also your senses will be on par with a nin kin. Be warned when you do you will feel immense pain. </B></P><P><B>If you are ready just walk up to the cage channel chakra to your feet and walk up it. Then you tear off 1/3 of it and you will probably pass out from the pain."</B></P><P>Naruto nodded, walked to the cage, channeled chakra to his feet, walked up the cage, and tore 1/3 of the seal off. Then he felt immense pain and fell to the ground.</P><P>Before he passed out he heard hitome say <B>"I will talk to you when you wake up, naruto-kun."</B></P><P><U>Outside</U></P><P>The man who save naruto was sitting next to him in the hospital waiting for him to wake up. Then he felt the seal slowly leak kyuubi's chakra. So he put a genjutsu over him so no one noticed.</P><P>'So hitome is some power just like kushina. Well now I know he will be strong when I start to train him.' Then he noticed it stopped so he released the genjutsu, and saw naruto stir.</P><P>Naruto opened his eyes and looked around. "Hello naruto my name is makoto. How are you feeling with the new power?" Naruto shielded his eyes and said "I am trying to get used to 10 fold my usual vision in a bright room, and my head is killing me."</P><P>Makoto nodded "Mine is 100 time better than a regular human. You will eventually get used to it." "By the way, how did you know about what happened?" asked naruto.</P><P>"One is because I taught hitome how to do that. Second is she did the same to your mother. Third is becausei saw the chakra leak out and put a genjutsu over it assuming she was doing the same thing." Said makoto.</P><P>Naruot's eyes grew wide "You knew my mother, and she was the kyuubi jinjuriki before me?" Makoto nodded "Yes, I will tell you some other time. Right now it seems we have some visitors."</P><P>Then the door opened to show the third hokage, hiruzen saratobi. "Hello naruto, how are you feeling?" asked the third.</P><P>Naruto frowned "Oh, just fine. Another beating and days without food, no big deal." Hiruzen frowned "I'm sorry I can't help. I wish I could but the council won't let me."</P><P>"You could at least get some ANBU guards to stay with me. Not follow me, take there masks off and protect me." Said naruto. "Also make sure that your ANBU don't want to kill me."</P><P>Hiruzen looked shocked and makoto put his hand on naruto's shoulder to calm him down. "Calm down, naruto. Don't let your emotions get to you. Also hiruzen your ANBU did try to kill him.</P><P>He's only alive because I came and killed the ANBU and the mob. Now I will watch over him as his legal guardian, the papers are already on your desk. He will be trained by me until he is old enough to go the academy.</P><P>Hiruzen nodded "Thank you, this will be better for him. By the way what is your name?" He removed his hood and said "Makoto Urahara." He had black hair with crimson highlights. His right eye had a slash over it and the other look different from a regular eye.</P><P>It was red with slit going up and down like kyuubi's and one going across. There was a ring in his eye with tome on it in each space. "cool eyes" was all naruto could say making everyone sweat drop. 'He maybe more mature, but he still is a kid' they thought.</P><P>'<B>Hey Naruto-kun, it's kyuubi. Tell the hokage about me' </B>"Hey jiji, I need to tell you something" said naruto. Hiruzen motioned for him to continue. "I can speak to mghh!" Makoto covered his mouth "Don't speak secrets if the room isn't secure."</P><P>Makoto's eye glowed and all the hidden ANBU came into view. "You all leave, now" spoke makoto with killer intent that scared the ANBU to leave instantly.</P><P>Hiruzen went through the hand signs and the room glowed blue. "Now the room is secure, you may continue" said hiruzen.</P><P>"Well I can talk to kyuubi, and don't worry she doesn't want to harm anyone she is also sorry for what she did. She actually gave me enhances senses, and made me stronger, faster, and more mature. She also mixed her chakra with mine to double my reserves and make it more potent and require less when performing jutsu."</P><P>Hiruzen nodded "Ok, as long as she doesn't asked to be released." "What's wrong with that?" asked makoto. "She would kill everyone!" yelled hiruzen.</P><P>"No she wouldn't, hiruzen. She was under a genjutsu when she attacked and never even wanted out of kushina, the seal was forcing her out. She was great friends with kushina and minato.</P><P>The reason kushina was so strong was because she trained her in her mindscape, along with teaching her about the hirashin. (AN: is that how you spell it?)</P><P>I know because I taught her when she was first separated from the juubi. I trained her and taught her and showed her how to use her powers and not to use them for evil.</P><P>Now I might let her out before we come back because the seal is designed so that when I let her out with a certain seal her power is determined by naruto. He can give her how much she wants but it doesn't affect the power already sealed.</P><P>That stays in there and the power is nature chakra changed into regular chakra. Lets go naruto, kyuubi's chakra already healed you." Naruto nodded, got up and followed makoto. "Hiruzen release the barrier or I will and half of the hospital will go with it."</P><P>The room glowed blue and makoto motioned for naruto to go out the door. He turned to hiruzen "We will be back the day the academy opens" and left.</P><P>Hiruzen sighed "Well at least naruto will be better off with someone to protect him. I need to make sure that I have some ANBU protect him when he get's back, and tell him his linage and give him what is rightfully his. Now back to the paperwork" hiruzen shuddered and walked out.</P><P>Makoto and naruto were walking out of the gate at the time. Once they got about five miles out makoto stopped and turned to naruto. "Well were going to be traning the whole time so I hope your up for it. Now hold on I'm going to teleport us there." He grabbed naruto's shoulder and they disappered in a crimson leaf shunshin.</P><P><B>Well that's the first chapter so review and please no flames as this is my first story. I will probably still post new chapters no matter how many reviews but still if I messed up please tell me so I can learn from my mistakes. Also there might me a small harm for naruto and there defiantly will be for makoto as you will learn later who is with now and will be paired with</B>.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>Thank you to all who took the time to read my story and thank you ace-kyuubi78546 for spelling hiraishin for me. If you can please review my story and tell me how I did. This chapter will be very short.</B></P><P>Legend:</P><P>"naruto"-talking</P><P>'<I>naruto.</I>'-thinking</P><P>"<B>naruto"-kyuubi talking</B></P><P>'<I><B>naruto</B></I><B>'-kyuubi thinking</B></P><P><B>Naruto-jutsu</B></P><P>'<B>naruto'-kyuubi speaking to naruto through link</B></P><P><U>Chapter 2</U></P><P>Naruto bolted up when electricity ran through his body. He looked to his right and saw makoto standing there with what looked like red lightning covering his hand. "I tried to wake you up by calling your name, but that didn't work. So I shocked you" he stated.</P><P>"Now get up and have some breakfast cause we will be staring your training." Naruto nodded then realized that he has no clothes except the torn ones he's wearing now. "Makoto, I have no clothes to wear besides these" motioning to the torn and dirty clothes he has on.</P><P>Makoto pointed to a closet door "There are clothes in there. Don't worry about the size, I can fix it." Naruto nodded and headed to the door. He turned the handle, opened the door, and walked inside. He was amazed at all the clothes he saw inside. He looked forward and saw that it went on for a while. 'How does this closet be that big? I know that his house isn't that big cause I saw it all from the guest bedroom.'</P><P>'<B>Fuinjustu'(correct me if I'm wrong) spoke kyuubi. 'I's pretty sure you'll learn it during your traning.' </B>Naruto nodded and started to look for a outfit. He passed a orange jumpsuit and shook his head. 'I would be better off wearing a target on my back.' He decided on a mesh shirt under a plain crimson shirt, black ANBU style pants with black combat boots. He had crimson gloves, and mask with black plates on the gloves.</P><P>Before he left he decided to get a black coat like makotot's. Naruto walked out and saw makoto sitting on a chair, next to a fire eating what looked like eggs, toast, bacon, and some fruit. Then he pointed to a plate on a chair on the other side of the fire place. "Eat up, you'll need energy and a lot of it if our training with me."</P><P>Once naruto finished his food they walked outside to a large training area. Makoto turned to him and said "Now, you will get a weapon like mine. Take off your coat" he said. Naruto took off his coat and handed it too him. He laid it open on the ground , held his hand out and in a poof a sword appered. He placed it on the sword and looked at naruto.</P><P>"You will need to do these handsigns, add a little chakra and say <B>Forbidden technique:Soul sword</B>." Naruto nodded, went through the handsigns, added a little chakra and said<B> Forbidden technique:soul sword </B>and blacked out.</P><P><U>SOULSCAPE</U></P><P>Naruto woke up in what looked like a white forest. He looked around to see a girl with crimson hair with white highlights, and beauty rivaling hitome. She had crimson eyes, and dress with a gold dragon that seemed to move, and no shoes. Her skin was white like the forest. "Hello naruto, I see makoto made you a sword. He was my sensei, along with all other sentient swords, that have been or will be made.</P><P>I never thought I would be the sword of one of his students. Either way I'm happy that I get to see him later, that is if it's ok with you." Naruto nodded "Sure I don't mine at all, but how will you see him if you'r in here and he's out their?</P><P>"There's a justu that allows me to be summoned outside. Also my name is…" "What I can't hear you" She frowned "Well when you can hear my name say it aloud and then I will talk to you again." Then he was kicked out of his soulscape.</P><P><U>OUTSIDE</U></P><P>Naruto woke up where he passed out on his coat. He noticed that there was now a crimson dragon on it that seemed to move, just like that women's gold dragon. "Cool but I wish I knew her name" said naruto. "So you don't know your swords name" said makoto standing across the clearing.</P><P>Naruto nodded, got up and put his coat on. "Well I only know one way that you might be able to hear her name. Life or death situation" and he summoned his sword. Then blade was black with crimson leaves moving on it. The guard was a gold leaf, with the handle cloth being black and the diamonds being crimson with a crimson chain hanging off the end of the handle. "Run" said makoto and dissappered.</P><P><B>Well that's that's chapter 2. It will be a while for chapter 4 as it is very long and I have semester test in school. I will post as soon as possible. Tune in next time for the next dragonball- just kidding. Please review and tell me how I did.</B></P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><B>Thanks to all who reviewed. It always helps to have some pointers when writing stories. Also the coat is actually a cloak, sorry. Also check the legend as I made a few changes. Well here's chapter 3</B></P><P>Legend:</P><P>"naruto"-talking</P><P>'naruto<I>.</I>'-thinking</P><P>"<B>naruto"-bijuu and sentient talking</B></P><P>'<I><B>naruto</B></I><B>'-bijuu and sentient thinking</B></P><P><B>Naruto-jutsu and sentient attacks</B></P><P>'<B>naruto'-bijuu and sentient speaking to naruto through link</B></P><P><U>Chapter 3</U></P><P>Dodging a lightning bolt, Naruto got up and continued running. Then he felt this instinct to hold his hand like he was gripping a sword and saw the dragon on his cloak clone it's self and separate from his cloak. Then it flew to his hand and formed a sword.</P><P>The sword was that same size as makotos's, but slightly different in color. His was a crimson blade but everything that was black on makoto's sword was white on his. Then he turned around and blocked a downward slash by makoto.</P><P>Makoto's superior strength pushed him back against a tree. "What the hell is your problem!" yelled naruto. "I understand wanting to help me learn my swords name, but I'm five for crying out loud!" "I will explain after you learn your swords name. I assume you did since you summoned it." Said makoto.</P><P>Naruto shook his head "No, I just had this feeling and followed it." Makoto frowned under the shade of his hood "Well only one thing left to do." He raised his sword high in the air and said "Roar BeniKaze" and swung downward. When he did a crimson dragon, made out of what seemed like blood, came flying at naruto. He knew he wasn't fast enough to dodge it, even with the extra boost in speed he was only five.</P><P>'<B>Hold your sword over your head' </B>said a voice in his head.Naruto didn't question it and did as he was told. <B>'Now say</B>. Makoto watched as the dragon approached the boy at blinding speeds. <I>'I hope he does learn his swords name or he's dead. Now what do I want for lunch?'</I></P><P>Then he heard naruto yell<B> Scream BeniRyuuHime</B> and a crimson crescent beam cut the dragon in half. Then he saw naruto walking out in between blood red flames. "Heh, wasn't so hard" said naruto, then passed out. Before he hit the ground makoto appeared and caught him. "Rest, naruto. You earned it, and be prepared for hell when you wake up." Natuto's body involuntary shivered.</P><P>Naruto woke up and notices something different about his surroundings. He looked around to see he was in makoto's house. "Huh, how did I end up here?" He tried to get up but pain shot through his body and forced him to stay down. "Don't try to get up. Your body is trying to get used to the new power. Well that and your body is exhausted from funning for a day strait."</P><P>"Shocker, right?" said naruto dryly. Makoto chuckled "Good one, now since your body needs to rest and you need to talk to your spirt I am going to send you to your soulscape to talk to her." Naruto nodded and watched as makoto touched his forehead with two fingers then he passed out again. Makoto pulled out a little orange book "Jiriya may be a perv but he knows how to write."</P><P><U>SOULSCAPE</U></P><P>Naruto felt his head in something soft and warm so he instinctively nuzzled his head in it. Then he heard in moan an- Wait! Moaned?! He lifted his head to see the lady from earlier with a shocked and blushing face. Naruto's faced turned red and he jumped off her saying "I-I-I'm s-s-s-sorry!"</P><P>The lady got up brushed her kimono off and hugged from behind, pressing her DD breasts into his back. "It's ok, naurto-kun. You can do anything you want to me." Narutos blushed deepened "U-uh M-miss." "It's rei, sweetie." She let go and appered in front of him "Now I don't like how you have the mind of a fifteen year old, but the body of a five year old. I am going to flood your body with my energy to make it grow to a match your maturity."</P><P>Naruto nodded "Ok, but only if you tell me how to summon you and hitome here so I can see, and be taught by you both." Rei nodded "I will, now you will just dream until you wake up. Your wounds and sores will heal at the same time." Then naruto saw red energy start to radiate off her and he started to fad away. Before he left he saw rei smile seductively at him and wave "Bye, naru-kun"</P><P><U>OUTSIDE</U></P><P>Makoto was cooking lunch when the guest bedroom started to radiate energy. He walked over to the opening to it and placed a seal on the wall. Then the room glowed green and the energy stopped coming. '<I>well that solves that problem. Now he will have more stamina to tortu- I mean train. Yeah train. Damn that also means that I have to give him the talk. Uggg stupid sprit being horny.'</I></P><P><U>A WEEK LATER</U></P><P>Naruto woke up and felt weird. He stood up and notices everything seemed shorter. <I>'Oh that's right! Rei made me grow to fifteen years old. Wonder what I look like?' </I>He walked to the bathroom to see what that growth did to him, and what he saw shocked him. His hair had grow to touch his shoulders, his face became more angular, his eyes are now blood red with a white slit going down it like a cat. He noticed that all his baby fat was gone and he had more muscles. He grabbed a red strip of cloth and tied his hair in a ponytail, then went to speak to makoto.</P><P>When he walked into the living room he saw makoto reading a orange book. "Hey, makoto. I" Makoto held his hand up "I know, I went through the same thing millennia's ago. Now your clothes are sitting on your bed, and they are fitted to your knew body. Once your done go outside as we have training to do." Naruto nodded and went to his room to change. He got all his clothes on a walked torwads the door. Before he made it out he saw makoto's book sitting there the table next to his chair. Naruto picked it up and started to walk and read.</P><P>Makoto was meditating under a sakura tree when he heard someone giggle. Confused, he looked up and saw naruto walking towards him, reading his book. Makoto smirked <I>'That's good. Now I don't have to give him the talk.'</I> Then naruto looked up and saw makot sitting there, smirking at him. "Umm, sorry. I saw it and started to read it. Is it ok if I borrow it?" said naruto. Makoto waved his hand "Go right ahead, I have another copy. Just make sure to remember it for later on in life" Naruto smiled and nodded "Thank you."</P><P>Then makoto turned serious "Now sit down under the other tree and meditate. This is part of training, it helps to calm the mind, so when you need to you just think of this o calm you in the most stressful situations."</P><P>After a couple hours makoto stood up "Now we will summon rei and hitome to do this exercise as well. To summon rei place your sword horizontally in front of you then go though these handsigns. After you have done that add about ¼ of your reserves, then slam your hands to the ground and say <B>summoning jutsu:Rei</B>."</P><P>Naruto nodded summoned his sword, placed it on the ground, went though the handsigns and added enough chakra, then slammed his hands to the ground and said <B>summoning jutsu:Rei</B>. Then in a poof of smoke Rei appeared standing in front of them. She smiled and waved at them "Hey, guys. Long time no see makoto-sensei." Makoto bowed his head "Hello, Rei. It has been to long and I'm not your sensei anymore, so stop saying it."</P><P>Then makoto turned to naruto "Now do the same things except without the sword and say hitome not rei." Naruto nodded, went though the handsigns, added the right amout of chakra, then slammed his hands to the ground saying <B>summoning jutsu:Hitome. </B>Then hitome appeared in a poof of smoke. She smiled at them "Hey how is it going, makoto?" Makoto shrugged "Same as usual.</P><P>Now We can have a reunion later, training comes first. Since it has been so long you both will go though it as well. Go and meditate under the sakura trees. I will say when we are finished." Everyone nodded and started to meditate under the sakura trees.</P><P>After about 4 hours makoto spoke "Now we will be adding gravity seals to everyone. I can tell you two took them off, even though I said only when you have to." Hitome and rei looked down in shame. "Since you both can withstand 30 times gravity I will put it up to 40. You both will go run around the village until I say so." He then walked up to them and placed a two fingers on both of their heads and they glowed. Once it died down they could feel the difference in gravity.</P><P>"That's why I say not to remove them unless necessary, The difference in gravity that quick is painful. Now start running." they nodded and took off. Makoto motioned for naruto to come closer. When he did makoto placed a finger on his head and he glowed. When it stopped he felt the pull of gravity on him. "You now are at 10 times gravity. The only reason you are standing is because of hitomes chakra strengthening you. Now start running, and I'm going to run with you."</P><P>Naruto nodded and let makoto go first so he could follow him. He maybe older, but he still hasn't explored the outside of the village. When the sun started to set a couple of hours later, makoto signaled them to stop. They walked to the clearing and everyone, except makoto, fell on the ground exhausted. Makoto simply walked calmly to the sakura tree and sat down.</P><P>Naruto turned his head to makoto "How are you not tired?" Makoto sighed "I might as well tell you." Naruto slowly sat up "Tell me what?" By now hitome and rei have already sat up and went to sit next to naruto. "The truth about me. I am called a creator. When kami came into existence, she created people called creators. They were made to create dimensions and watch over them so she could watch over the god realm.</P><P>There are 4 of us, including me. We watch over the dimensions we create, and also have battles to see who is leader of all of us. Only the three strongest gods can tell us what to do, Kami, Yami, and Shingami. I am the leader, as I was created first and have more knowledge, and power. It was just me at first, but then they realized that I couldn't do it alone so the gods make 3 more.</P><P>There are battles ever century to see who is strongest. Other than that, they can't attack me. There are other reasons they can challenge me, but you don't need to know that right now. Now when I meditate I look at all my dimensions to make sure that everything is ok. I will only stop a war if it affects the dimension, or someone is doing something that might over throw the balance of the dimension. The powers of me are the powers of creators, their apprentices, or creation can have. The other creators are ranked by power as well.</P><P>We go by numbers I am 1st, my oldest brother is 2nd, the second oldest is 3rd. My only sister is the youngest and is 4th. She has enough power to take on the entire elemental nations, win, and would only be mildly exhausted. I could just use a mid power attack and completely decimate this world, that is the difference in power. I can take on kami, the strongest god, and win with being slightly winded, my oldest brother can beat Yami, the weakest of the three, and barley win.</P><P>The power of a creator is amazing, but so are our creations. I am the only one that can make powerful creations, as only someone with my power could have that much to use. My most powerful creation, ichigo kurosaki, could just barely beat my oldest brother. Juubi could barely beat my sister, and just to let you know juubi is sealed inside of me. The moon was a meteor that hit earth and was sucked into its orbit. The sage of the six paths just sealed it inside of himself, and once he died I sealed in inside of me.</P><P>I would have let it roam in demon world, but then it might go back into this world and be sealed again. It actually was sealed because the sage did not trust the demon. The sage even got all of his powers from the juubi. I believe that is all you need to know for now."</P><P>Naruto just sat there shocked and what he said. After about 10 minutes of hitome and rei trying to get his attention he shook his head and looked at makoto. "So am I one of your apprentices now?" Makoto nodded "Yes, along with a few others in this world you might meet later in life." Makoto looked around to see that is was dark so he went though a few handsigns and the trees were set on fire. Naruto was about to freak out when makoto raised his hand "It's a jutsu that make any objects I imagine only lit the surrounding of it on fire, but not burn it. I will teach it to you later.</P><P>Now I waited till night to do this. I am going to give you eye's like mine, but the only difference to your eyes will be a black horizontal slit going across it. Your eyes will act like the sharingan, byakugan, and rinnengan mixed, as well as your sight will improve. Don't worry though, since I will be giving them to you, you won't have the brightness problem."</P><P>He walked up to him and placed two fingers on his forehead "Are you sure you want this? You can't go back." Warned makoto. Naruot nodded and closed his eyes, and then felt his eyes tingle a bit, and makotos finger no longer on his forehead. "Open them" spoke makoto. Naruto opened his eyes and noticed that he could see more clearly than before, and that the light from the fire didn't hurt his eyes.</P><P>"I don't really see a difference" said naurto. Then he sensed something and moved his head back as he barley dodged hitomes fist. "What the hell?!" yelled naruto. "See you wouldn't have been able to dodge that if your eyes didn't sense it" said makoto. Then hitome spoke "My eyes have the same powers but on a lesser scale. They can sense things that only gods can. Rei's are the same way." Then hitome sat next to him and laid her head on his right shoulder, and rei did the same on the other side. "Well you guys can all fit on the bed naruto has been laying in, I have to watch over my dimensions" said makoto. Naruto nodded, got up along with rei and hitome, and they went to lie down.</P><P><U>NEXT DAY</U></P><P>Makoto sensed someone coming and opened his eye and saw naruto, and rei walking towards him with hitome asleep on narutos back. Makoto chuckled "I had the same problem with her when I first had her as an apprentice." Naruto set her down and smiled at her sleeping form. "She looks so peaceful" he said as he brushed a stray hair out of her face. Hitome was having a peaceful sleep until she felt something brush against her face and opened her eyes, and what she saw made her blush. She saw naruto's face right in front of hers smiling.</P><P>"Hey" said naruto. Hitome sat up all the way and looked around "Um, hey. How did I get out here?" "Well we all woke up and you wouldn't so I decided to carry you out here and set you down under this tree." Hitome smiled at him "Thank you. Well should we go ahead and get started." Naruto nodded and offerd a hand to her, and she accepted it with a thank you.</P><P>Then makoto touched his hand to the ground and one wood post came up along with 2 metal post. "Naruto the wood one is for you, all of you will do 200 punches and kicks then 100 pushups and situps. You will take a short break then run around the village for a couple of hours. Then take a lunch break. Then naruto will learn the shadow clone and I will start to teach you along with hitome and rei."</P><P>Everyone nodded and went off to start. Once everyone finished running they stopped for a lunch break. As they were finishing up eating makoto stood up and looked at naruto. "To make shadow clones make a cross symbol and add chakra. You can make 1000 clones easy, I will make 5 and they will split up into groups. One for ninjutsu, one for genjutsu, one for taijutsu, one for fuinjutsu, and one for kinjutsu. We will be doing this same routine for the next five years." Everyone nodded and got ready for training. <B>(A/N: I won't go into the training trip. I just started so you would get the gist of it. What he learned will be showed either later in flashback or when fighting/training.)</B></P><P><B>Well that's chapter 3 and I will have chapter 4 up shortly. It will be my longest chapter to date. Please review.</B></P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P><B>I had a lot of extra time over the weekend SSJ3 kyuubi gohan brought up a good point. Rei taught naruto kenjutsu and some jutsu, and hitome taught him to use her powers, and demon moves. Sorry about that everyone. Well here's chapter 4</B></P><P>Legend:</P><P>"naruto"-talking</P><P>'naruto<I>.</I>'-thinking</P><P>"<B>naruto"-bijuu and sentient talking</B></P><P>'<I><B>naruto</B></I><B>'-bijuu and sentient thinking</B></P><P><B>Naruto-jutsu and sentient attacks</B></P><P>'<B>naruto'-bijuu and sentient speaking to naruto through link</B></P><P><U>Chapter 4</U></P><P>Izumo and kotetsu<B> (A/N: Tell me if I didn't spell it right)</B> were trying not to fall asleep at their post until they saw three cloaked figures approaching. The tallest had crimson leaves on his cloak that seemed to move to an imaginary wind. The second tallest had crimson dragon on his that moved. The third had golden fox moving around, and the last was the same height as the third but had the design as the second. They all stopped and the tallest turned to them "I, and my friends are here to see the hokage."</P><P>Izumo stood up and said "Ok, well we will have ANBU trail you for security measures." The figure nodded "It won't matter, as they aren't fast enough anyway." Izumo was confused at first until they disappeared and he yelled for ANBU to go alert the hokage.</P><P>In the hokages office he was battling the bane of all kages, paperwork. Then he saw four cloaked figures appear in front of him and then his ANBU appeared in front of him, swords drawn. The tallest chuckled then the ANBU's weapons fell to the floor. "Tell your ANBU to stand down hiruzen" spoke the figure.</P><P>Hiruzen notices something familiar in it's voice so he told his ANBU to stand down and once they did there swords appeared in there hands, and they disappeared. Then he watched as they all removed there hoods, shocking him. The first he recognized as makoto, the second looked like the yondaime, the other two just looked hot to him. "Hey, hiruzen. Long time no see" spoke the second figure. Then he heard something familiar in his voice "Naurto?" The figure smiled "Took you long enough." "You changed so much, how?"</P><P>Naruto shrugged "Stuff, now these girls next to me are the real reason I came to talk to you. First put a silencing seal, as this is very sensitive information." Hiruzen nodded, went through a few handsigns and the room glowed blue for a second and he motioned for him to continue. "Well the first is hitome, otherwise known as kyuubi. Now don't freak out, she is actually very nice and my girlfriend.</P><P>Now the next one is rei, my sentient sword spirit, and my girlfriend as well. She isn't evil or anything so nothing to worry about. Now can I go into the academy, and no I will not use anywhere near my full power and neither will rei, or hitome." Hiruzen soaked in all the information and thought for a minute "Sure, just don't kill anyone" they all deflated at that "Unless they deserve it." They all smiled and nodded. Then hiruzen wrote a note and told him where to go and they all jumped out the window.</P><P>Hiruzen watched them leave and then looked back at makoto. "How come you said they could kill if that person deserved it. I didn't think that you were like that" said makoto. "Well first he would do it anyway if anyone attacked those girls, and second he will probably take out any root agents in there as I know it is obvious to someone of their caliber."</P><P>"Now, when will you get rid of the civilian council?" asked makoto. "Never, I will just strip them of most of their power so they can watch helplessly as we make decisions" said a smirking hiruzen. Makoto smirked as well "Couldn't do that any better myself. Well that's all I have to ask for now.</P><P>I will be around the neighborhood and I already have a place that me and my group will be staying. So have fun with the council" and he disappeared, not in speed just simply not there anymore. Hiruzen shook his head "Man, he's fast. Now on to paperwork, I wonder how fast a fireball can burn it" said a evil looking hiruzen.</P><P>Naruto and Co. appeared in front of the academy and walked towards the room number on the paper. Once they found it and entered they saw a teacher with pineapple shaped hair and a scar going across his nose. He turned to the group "Hello, may I help you?" he asked. Naruot handed him the slip of paper and he read it.</P><P>Iruka read the paper with wide eyes then looked at the girl with black highlights. Naruto stepped in front of her and he smiled "It's ok, I won't do anything, just shocked is all. I may have lost my parents to it but I usually don't hold a grudge when it doesn't know what it is doing."</P><P>They all looked at him shocked "How did you know?" "Well I'm pretty sure that it doesn't have the sharingan so yeah" said iruka. "Now why don't you go take a seat next to sasuke. Sakura, Ino! Move over for the new students." They both grumbled but moved over, and the group sat down with hitome first followed by naruto then rei. Iruka started to talk about history so hitome and rei leaned on naruto's shoulder, sasuke started to stare out the window, and sakura took notes.</P><P>Then half way through class iruka stopped the lesson "Well now it's time to go outside for a spar and the class will be dismissed for the day." Everyone nodded and followed iruka outside except naruto, rei, and hitome. They just jumped out the window when everyone left. Once everyone got there iruka called out "Now this is only taijutsu spar. Boys first, sasuke vs. naruto." Both got to their sides and sasuke had his fangirls screaming him on. Naruto just scoffed at him "Not worth my time" and started to walk off. Then sasuke said "Going back to your whores?"</P><P>Then naruto turned around so fast that dust was kicked up and everyone was silent. <B>(A/N: Like what tigris did on kung fu panda 2. And for a kid's movie it was pretty good)</B> "Iruka start the match, now" growled naruto. Iruka gulped, prayed for sasuke, and said "Being."</P><P>Sasuke charged at naruto at what he and the academy students thought was fast but extremely slow to naruto. Sasuke attepted to punch naruto but all he hit was air as naruto disappeared. Then he was picked up by someone from behind by his shirt and slammed to the ground, making a spider web crack in the ground. Then as he tried to get up he was punched in the gut by naruto making a small crater.</P><P>Naruot removed his had from sasuke's gut and spat on him "Pathetic" Iruka smirked <I>'That put the uchiha down a few notches.' </I>"Winner, naruto!" he said. Naruto smirked when heard the whispers of how the mighty uchiha got beat by the new kid. He walked to a tree right outside of the fighting ring and jumped on the first branch where rei and hitome were sitting. He noticed that hitome had blood shot eyes and rei had an arm around her in a comforting position.</P><P>Naruto picked up hitome, sat down next to rei, and placed her in his lap. He hugged her as she silently cried "Shhh, It's going to be fine. You aren't a whore, no matter what anyone says. You're my girl, and a beautiful one as well. Don't listen to what anyone tells you otherwise."</P><P>"He's right, hitome. Don't listen to what anyone says about you. Trust me I know, as I created you" said someone behind them. They turned around to see makoto standing on a limb then disappeared with a note in his place. Rei got up and looked at it. It said <I>"Go to the hotel next to naruto's old house to sleep. I own the whole thing so just walk through the front." </I>Then they heard iruka calling them so they jumped down and walk over there.</P><P>Sasuke saw naruto carrying the redhead with black highlights in his arm and she looked like she was crying. He smirked until he saw naruto look at him with his piercing blue eyes that promised death and stopped. Iruka cleared his throat and said "Well now it's time for the girls rei vs. ino" Ino walked out and rei kissed naruto on the lips then headed out as he walked to the edge of the ring to watch. "Begin" said iruka. Ino charged and went to punch rei but she blocked it with ease. Then rei used the momentum to flip her on her but. Ino growled, and stood up.</P><P>She drew a kunai and swung at rei, but rei just grabbed her wrist and twisted it, and made her drop the kunai. Rei grabbed it and held it against her throat. Then iruka appeared between them to separate them, and took the kunai at the same time. "Winner rei. Next is sakura vs. hitome." ?</P><P>"Will you be ok?" he asked her. Hitome nodded "Yes, I'm fine for now. Will you 'comfort' me after we go lay down?" Naruot chuckled remembering the last time he 'comforted' her. "Yes, of course I will." Hitome smiled and walked to her side of the fighting ring. "Begin" said iruka. Sakura drew a kunai and threw it, and hitome dodged it easily. Then she saw sakura throw shruikens so she made a small kunai out of black leafs that seemed to come off her cloack., and deflected them. Then sakura charged at her with kunai in each hand. She swung at her but hitome blocked them and her blade cut though both of the kunai.</P><P>Then she appeared behind her with the blade to her neck. Iruka appeared in between both, separating them. "Winner hitome." he said. Sakura did exactly what ino did and hitome walked over to naruto and sat on the other side of him with her head resting on his shoulder. Once everyone was done Iruka dismissed the class and rei and hitome followed naruto to where ever he was going.</P><P>After about 10 minutes, they wound up at a ramen bar. Naruto walked in and said "Hey Techui-jiji<B> (A/N: Did I spell that right?)</B>, long time no see." Then a butcher knife implanted itself in a wall next to his head. "No one can call my daddy that exce- Naurto!" said a brunette that looked about 12 years old. Then a older looking man came out of the back "Naruto? Is that really you?" Naruto smiled at them "Yes, it's really me, old man." Then the girl came around the counter and hugged him "Hey, ayame. Sorry I left without telling you. I promise I won't do it again."</P><P>Ayame sniffled and grabbed the butcher knife and pointed it at him "You better not." Naruto smiled at her "Well not that I don't like being threatened, can we each have a bowl of miso ramen?" Ayame nodded and Headed to the back to prepare the food. Techui came back while ayame was cooking and looked at naruto "So how has life been?" "Fine, oh these are my two girlfriends rei, and hitome."</P><P>Both smiled and waved at him "Done!" shouted ayame. She came and set the bowls down in front of them, then looked at the two girls. "You better keep him in line." Both looked at her for a minute then nodded, and smiled. Once they finshed they thanked the two and left to look around the village. They stopped at a training ground to watch two people, one man one girl, fighting with swords. Then the girl notices them watching and decided to scare them a bit and disappeared. She reappeared behind the guy and was going to whisper in his ear until she was kicked across the field. She stopped skidding and looked to see the guy standing there, sword in hand. She smirked and charged at him.</P><P>She got within range and swung only for her sword to be blocked then pushed away like it was nothing. So she used the momentum and did a 360 spin and went to kick him in his head. He disappeared and reappeared next to her, leg raised high in the air. Naruto was going to kick her to the ground when he sensed someone about to stab him so he did a back flip over the person behind him.</P><P>Then naruto put his sword to the man's neck and he dropped his sword. As the woman got up the girl with white highlights appeared behind her, sword at her neck. The woman put her hand up "Calm down, I was only going to scare you until you attacked." Naruto nodded and put his sword away from the man's neck, as did rei to the woman's neck. They both picked up there sword and introduced themselves.</P><P>"My name is yuugao uzuki" said the woman that was wearing ANBU gear. "And I am hayate gekiko" said the man in jonin gear. Naruto stepped forward "I'm Naruto, the one with black highlights is hitome, and the one with white highlights it rei." "You two were really good. I have never seen someone dodge an attack from behind, except the hyuuga's and uchiha's" said hayate. Naruto smiled "Thank you, you two weren't so bad yourself. Just work on your speed, and your reflexes, and your good to go." They nodded, said thank you, and headed off. Naruto, and rei put away their swords and then the girls followed naruto.</P><P>Half way there naruto grabbed the wrist of someone with a kunai and threw it across the street. The figure stood up to show a purple haired woman with hair like iruka's. She was wearing a mesh body suit, tan trench coat, and rust oranges short shorts. "How dare you impersonate the yoindame!" she said and charged. She threw the kunai at him and went to punch his head. Before she could, a silver haired jonin appeared and held her back. "Let me go, kakashi!" she yelled. "Anko, calm down. That's naruto, the kid you used to watch while in ANBU." With that anko calmed down a bit, got free of kakashi's grip, and left in a swirl of leaves.</P><P>Kakashi looked at naruto "Sorry about that. She is sensitive about him for some reason." Naruto waved it off "It's fine, and give obito, and minato my prayers." Kakashi nodded solemnly and left in a swirl of leaves. Naruto put his hand one both rei, and hitome's shoulder and the disappeared with a white dragon swirling around them.</P><P>Once they got to the hotel they sensed makoto on the roof meditating, so they decied to leave him alone and went to sleep. As naruto fell asleep he thought how he had two of the most powerful people laying in bed with him.</P><P>The next day naruto woke up and slowly got out of bed, careful not to wake the girls. Once he got dressed he went to the roof to meditate until it was time to go back to the academy. He got to the roof to see makoto meditating with a silver haired girl leaning on his shoulder. Naruto put a high level genjutsu over the roof, then summoned a sakura tree right behind makoto. Then he went to meditate on the opposite side.</P><P>Makoto smirked as he noticed naruot summon a sakura tree, and go meditate. Then he felt the woman next to him stir. He opened his eye and saw her yawn, and stretch. She looked around then at him "Hello, makoto-kun. How did this tree get here?" "My apprentice, naruto. He summoned it and is meditating on the other side" he said.</P><P>Then he heard the door open and the person said "Hey makoto, mika. Where's naruto?" asked hitome. Mika pointed to the tree "Other side of the tree." "Naruto-kun!" yelled hitome. Naruto stood up and walked around the tree "Yes?" "Rei wants to her there early, so let go" said hiome. Naruto nodded and followed her down stairs. Mika turned to makoto "So, how are your dimensions?" she asked. "Fine for now, but I might have to go to a couple later on. One is about to be torn apart, and another is where some of my apprentices are getting in trouble as I told they to hid their power, and the people there fighting are getting bigger in numbers." Mika nodded, sat in his lap and leaned on his chest. "Can I come with you?" she asked. Makoto smiled at her and wrapped an arm around her waist "Sure."</P><P>Naruto and the girls just appeared at the academy where iruka was getting the lesson ready. They waved at him and took their seats. Naruto leaned against the back of the desk behind him and rei leaned against him and hitome got up and sat on his lap. About 30 minutes later most of the class was in the classroom when they heard "I'M GOING TO WIN INO-PIG!" said someone. Then another yelled "IN YOUR DREAMS, FOREHEAD!" Then a pink and platinum blonde cam racing into the classroom and both jumped on sasuke yelling "I WIN!" Naruto reached over, pulled them off sasuke, and threw them over his head.</P><P>Sasuke got up and looked at naruto "Thank you, I can never get them away from me." Naruto nodded "No problem, there pretty annoying. Why don't you tell them that, along with the rest of your fangirls?" Sasuke thought for a minute "I will the next time we spar." Naruto smiled and nodded his head. Then before iruka could start the lesson sakura yelled "NARUTO-BAKA! MOVE SO WE CAN SIT NEXT TO SASUKE-KUN!" Naruto didn't say anything as he was holding his sensitive ears along with hitome, rei, and kiba. "Sakura!" yelled iruka. "They all have sensitive ears, like kiba's. Don't yell it hurts them extremely bad." Sakura didn't listen to him</P><P>"WILL YOU JUST MO-" then she along with everyone else was on the floor gasping for breath by naruto's KI. Naruto looked at her with his eyes activated "Sakura, don't ever yell again in front of me or these girls. If you do I will torture you nonstop for 3 days." Then he released the KI he used off of everyone, then went to help rei and hitome up. As naruto helped rei up he turned to see sasuke helping hitome up. Naruto smiled at him "Thanks." Sasuke nodded "You gave me a way to get rid of my fan girls, and made sakura stop yelling. Of course I'm going to help your girlfriend out."</P><P>Then Hitome sat back in naruto's lap, and rei leaned on his shoulder, and naruto wrapped his arm around both of their waist's. Iruka waited for naruto to get finished then started his lesson. Once iruka started naruto and his girls fell asleep, sasuke started to rethink his life choices, and shino was well shino. About 2 hours later an ANBU appeared and asked for naruto, rei, and hitome to follow him. Naruto picked up hitome bridal style, and rei jumped on his back. Then naruto followed the ANBU to whoever called him.</P><P>Naruto followed the ANBU to what he guessed the council chambers. The ANBU opened the doors and motioned for him to go inside. Naruto walked inside and saw the civilian side glaring at him, and the shinobi side glaring at the civilians. "Now, why have you called me here?" asked naruto. "We will be evaluating your skills, along with these's girls" said a fat civilian. Naruto placed hitome, and rei down and put them behind him. "You will have to go through me, and I know for a fact that it is impossible." Danzo scoffed "Please, you couldn't even kill a rookie anbu."</P><P>Then the man exploded to show makoto standing behind him two fingers extended, and mika's back against his. "To take out roots completely you find the seed first then the roots will crumble" and a blank masked ANBU fell from the ceiling, dead. Hiruzen nodded his head "Thank you, I always knew he still had that program going." Maktoto nodded and disappeared in swirl of black fire.</P><P>"Now"said hiruzen. "We will evaluate your skills only whatever you get is just so we know what missions we can give you alone, not in team." Then hitome said "Why don't you just fight him, naruto-kun. Not that he could win anyway." Hiruzen nodded and smiled "That sounds like a great idea. Be at training ground 7 in a few minutes." Then naruto and the girls left, leaving a shocked council. "You all need to be here as wintnesses" said hiruzen, and everyone nodded.</P><P>Once everyone arrived at the training ground, they saw hiruzen standing there with his battle gear on, and naruto standing calmly on the other side. The council decided to stand by rei and hitome that were sitting on a tree a little distance away. Then makoto appeared in between them "I will be the proctor for this match, Begin" Hiruzen summoned enma and he transformed into a staff, then hiruzen charged at naruto. Naruto simply stopped the staff with his hand and then kick hiruzen away.</P><P>Right as he was standing up he heard naruto say <B>Earth style: spikes of death</B> and saw earth spikes coming at him. Before they reached him he jumped in the air and went through handsigns <B>fire style: Grand fireball</B> and shot a huge fireball at naruto. Naruto looked impassive then charged it, and before touching it he raised his hand and punched it, making it disperse. While in freefall he went though handsigns and said <B>scorch release: demons fire</B> and shot a flame from his mouth the shape of kyuubi. Hiruzen knew there was no was no way to stop something that hot, so he braced for impact. The council watched in horror as there hokage was ingulfed in flames. When he fell to the ground he attempted to stand but felt a sword at his neck.</P><P>Then makoto appeared between them to separate them. "Winner naruto." He said. Then he walked up placed a hand on him, and he was healed instantly. "Naruto, as for beating me you get to have any missions you chose. Now I must go back to work, and you three have the rest of the day off" said hiruzen then disappeared, along with the council and makoto. Naruto just stared for a few minutes then shook his head "Man, I need to get some sleep. C'mon girls, let's go home" he said then disappeared in a burst of speed, and the girls quickly followed.</P><P>Once they appeared there they noticed that makoto wasn't there, and couldn't sense him anywhere in the village "I wonder where he is?" asked naruto. He sat down in the middle of the floor and meditated trying to sense makoto. He couldn't even find him in fire country, so he expanded his search to the whole nation and still couldn't find him. Naruto opened his eyes and stood up "I can't sense him anywhere. I know he can mask his presence , but he wouldn't just disappear like that without telling us." Then he turned around to check and see if he was on the roof masking his presense to meditate, but he wasn't there. As naruto lay down he thought <I>'I wonder where he is?'</I></P><P><B>Man! That was my longest chapter to date. I sure hope all you enjoyed it, and tell me if you like it, or if there is any problems with it. If I make a mistake I will correct in my author note and the beginning of the next chapter. Well that's all for now. GoodNight Tomball! </B></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P><B>Sorry it's been so long since I posted. I have been having some family troubles so I won't be posting a frequent as the first few chapters. Naruto will have a small harem. He will gain a couple more but not anytime soon. Then guy who trained naruto was maktoto if that was unclear to any of you. Well hope you enjoy the work and don't forget a review with ideas helps the story become better for you.</B></P><P><B>Disclaimer: I do not own naruto or highschool of the dead, yet *evil laugh and lighting* </B></P><P>Legend:</P><P>"naruto"-talking</P><P>'naruto<I>.</I>'-thinking</P><P>"<B>naruto"-bijuu and sentient talking</B></P><P>'<I><B>naruto</B></I><B>'-bijuu and sentient thinking</B></P><P><B>Naruto-jutsu and sentient attacks</B></P><P>'<B>naruto'-bijuu and sentient speaking to naruto through link</B></P><P><U>Chapter 5</U></P><P><U>Takagi manor</U></P><P>While the rest of the group was listing to saya talk about why there electrical devices went down shizuka was smiling and kept saying "He's coming" over and over. Once saya finished her speech she looked at shizuka worryingly "Sensei, are you ok? You have been saying that ever since this all started." "He promised me that when things that shouldn't happen start to he will appear" said shizuka. "Who is he, sensei" asked takashi. She smiled even wider "My boyfriend. He is very special but he told me not to tell anyone his name or who he is unless he tells me it's ok" Then alice saw zeke run around the side of the house so she went to get him.</P><P>As everyone was getting ready and people were setting up candles they heard a scream and the whole group looked to the right to see alice being bitten on the arm by <B>them</B>. Before anyone could do anything a sword cleaved his head clean off his body and the girl fell to the ground, a dead dog in her hands. The figure simply flicked the blood if his blade before it scattered into black and crimson leaves that attached themselves to his black cloak with crimson leaves on it that seemed to move on their own.</P><P>The figure walked up to the girl and knelt down "I am sorry I was slow getting here, alice. I wish I could heal you but I am not allowed. Are you ready to meet your mommy, daddy and zeke or do you say goodbye to your friends first?" Alice sniffled then pointed to the group of people that were still rooted to their spot. The figure nodded, picked her up in one arm and walked towards the group. Once he got there he set her down and made sure she didn't fall then stood back up. "Alice here has been bitten and she has a couple minutes left. Say your goodbyes then tell me when you are done. Now is not the time for questions, they will be answered afterwards."</P><P>As everyone started to say goodbye shizuka pushed passed them and looked at the cloaked figure closely, confusing everyone as why she wasn't saying goodbye. "Makoto-kun?" said shizuka. The figure nodded and removed his hood, showing the smile on it. He had an angular face, black hair with crimson highlights, and a scar on his right eye. The other one was red with a black cross design in it, and had a ring in it with what looked like tome in each space. "Hey, shizuka-chan. Sorry I have been gone for so long" he said with a sad smile. Shizuka smiled back, tears welling up in her eyes. Then she jumped on him and smothered him in a hug saying "I missed you so much" Makoto hugged her back and set her down "I missed you to, love. I think we can have a reunion later right now you need to say goodbye to your friend." Shizuka nodded and turned to say there last goodbyes to the little girl.</P><P>After a couple minutes makoto spoke "Alice, I'm sorry but it's time to go." Alice nodded and said one last goodbye when ran to makoto. He knelt down and put two fingers on her forehead "Goodbye, alice. Tell kami that makoto said hi" She nodded and then he closed his eye and said "Shatter" and the girl and dog broke into sakura petals and floated away with the wind. "That was different then the other one that you used, makoto-kun" said shizuka. "I have different versions and that was one for a situation like this one. Now any question you would like to ask or did a couple of you realize who I am yet" he said smirking.</P><P>Soishiro spoke first "Makoto Urahara, the supposed creator of this world and many other. His power is something that transcends our world and whatever it will obtain. He taught the first samurai and then disappeared. It was told a true story at first then just turned into a legend, I never believed it myself." Makoto outstretched his arms "Well here's your proof, and to make sure you believe me" he then appeared behind him with his sword at his neck. "Is that proof enough" he said starling the others, besides shizuka, that he appeared there so quickly.</P><P>Then the sword dissappated and he walked towards where soishiro was standing and looked out at the garden. "Anything eles?" he asked. "Yeah, if you're so strong why don't you kill all of <B>them</B>?" questioned saya, clearly annoyed. "Simple, kami or my mother has set rules so that we cannot interfere to much with the worlds natural turn of events. Since shizuka-chan is here I cam to help you. I am pushing to boundaries of that rule right now. I can kill them but not with my more powerful moves. The dimension I was in before was going to collapse in on itself if I didn't help the new generation. I still haven't taken care of the problem yet as I only started Now if I didn't interfere then this world would survive, but barley. I am here to help keep this group alive. These people right here are the ones that I will heal to keep alive, I don't care what my mother says, I can take her.</P><P>Now I have already put an invisible seal on all of you so if you get bit or hurt, no matter how bad, you will heal instantly. Only you guys can withstand the bite and live. Now I will stay with shizuka-chan's group and soishiro's group will go with what they were originally doing. Anything you would like to know?" Saya pushed up her glasses "You sound like your more strength then brains. I need to know how much knowledge you posses to see if you are a capable leader." "I have lived for many millennia and learned everything in all of my dimensions. The knowledge I know can't fit in the memory of all computers ever created combined."</P><P>Then he eye smiled at her "what about you? She looked at her feet and blushed in embarrassment as she mumbled something. "What?" asked makoto. She raised her head but looked away from him "I said mine couldn't even fill a new one." Makoto nodded "Then don't boast on how smart you are if you don't know how smart someone else is. Even then don't boast and act higher than the other person, because everyone is better than someone at something. Kohta is chubby but he can shoot a gun better than most can."</P><P>Saya nodded "Hai, I will be better about how I act towards others." "Good, now get the hummer fixed because there are a horde of <B>them</B> on the way. I can take them down but we can't stay here forever." The group nodded and left to see how the hummer was coming along and makoto turned to the takagi heads "I will protect your daughter, not that it would matter being immortal and all." Their eye's grew huge "Immortal! You said that it just made so we healed instaltly!" "If you heal instantly then the age of your body would heal before anything even happens." He deadpanned.</P><P>They thought this over and realized there mistake and apologized. He waved his hand "It's fine, no harm done. Now I have already had clones fix all electronic devices so you can use them for whatever you need. I will go along and fix anyone else's devices and tell them to contact you so you know where we have been and what back-up you have." Then he turned to see the beginning of the group of <B>them </B>coming up the hill. He turned to the takagi heads "Well that's my queue, see you later" then disappeared. As maddo was fixing the vehicle he saw a figure appear next to him. He watched as he placed a hand on the vehicle then it repaired itself. He turned to him and saw him say "don't ask" and walked away. As everyone was getting ready to fight makoto appeared</P><P>"Everyone get in the hummer, I will clear us a path." Everyone looked at him like he was crazy till they saw how serious he was and got inside the vehicle. Before shizuka got in makoto turned her around and kissed her. Her eye's, including all watching, fly open then her's closed as pleasure over took her. Then he separated then hugged her tightly "Don't crack under pressure and listen to what I saw when we get to the roadblock." She hugged back and nodded. He let go and opened the door for her and she stepped in. He closed and walked out "Now I want to go as soon as I say now earlier." Shizuka nodded and buckled herself in the seat as she watched him appear at the front entrance.</P><P>Makoto summoned his sword then took off towards the group of undead. Everyone watched as he slaughtered <B>them.</B> As they started to surround him he disappeared and reappeared behind the group, his arm arched to the side. He said "Scream benikaze" and swung. When he did a crimson arch of energy cut all of their heads from their shoulders. "Let's go shizuka-chan!" Shizuka started up the vehicle and drove towards him. As they passed shoshiro and yuriko saya waved at her father and he ignored her. As they neared makoto he jumped and landed on the roof of the vehicle and turned to the two takagi clan heads. He did a two finger wave then jumped in the vehicle.</P><P>"Where do I head to?" asked shizuka. "Let's go to the highway so we can check on rei and takashi's parents" said saya in an annoyed tone. "Saya, your father didn't acknowledge you because he wanted you to know that he can't save you out here. I don't entirely agree with it but he has to get you to let go of always being protected and be your own person. Even though he won't be here we will and I will teach you what you want to know on how to fight." Said makoto. Saya nodded "Thank you for that." Makoto nodded his head and turned to shizuka "Just stay on this path and go to the barricade at full speed, I will take care of the rest" and jumped onto of the roof. As they approached the barricade that was broken by a bus that hit it shizuka stepped harder on the petal. Makoto channeled chakra to his hand and set it on the edge of the roof of the vehicle.</P><P>He channeled chakra to his feet and set them on the bottem of the side of the vehicle and leaned to the side and the hummer tilted to the side with him. "Keep it up and don't let off the gas, shizuka-chan" said makoto. Then he saw saeko fall out off the top of the vehicle so he jumped up, grabbed her, channeled chakra to his feet and ran along the wall, keeping pace with the hummer. Once it passed the barricade makoto jumped back in, making the vehicle set back down on all four wheels.</P><P>"Thank you" said saeko." Makoto placed her on the seat next to him and nodded his head. "Just keep going to the highway and I will tell you what to do from there." Shizuka nodded and continued on her path. Once they got to the highway they saw many of <B>them</B> blocking the path. Makoto appeared in front of the vehicle and turned to the group "Just wait till I clear a certain length of area then we will move forward. Since the rules on this world don't allow me to use many thing I can do except speed and strength and my swords powers, it will be slow progress."</P><P>He turned around and summoned his sword and charged. They all stared in awe as he annihilated <B>them </B>faster than the eye can see. All they saw was a blur, blood, and body parts from both sides of the highway. Saya looked at shizuka to see her just smiling at him. "How can you smile as he kills all of <B>them</B>? I don't see how it's something to smile at." She said. Shizuka turned to her "Because I haven't seen him in so long. Even watching him do this brings a smile to my face knowing that he is here, and that I am safe." Saya thought it over and realized that she probably hasn't seen him in forever and been alone for so long.</P><P>"Sorry" said saya with her head down. Shizuka then said "Don't be. He told me before we started dating but I agreed to it. It isn't your fault I choose this' she said sadly. Saya nodded her head in understanding and looked back at the massacre that was happing so she could get used to seeing it. "Man, I never thought I would see one person do all this" said rei slightly scared. Everyone just nodded their heads in acknowledgement. "I read some stories about him. He has taken down entire nations in a matter of hours and came back without a scratch and no exhaustion. He has also been sighted in the helping of building of empires, but nothing has been confirmed" said saeko.</P><P>"Hey!" said makoto and everyone turned to him. They saw that 1/3 of the bridge was already cleared, including cars. "Come and get closer, I don't want you far if they start to come from behind." Shizuka nodded and drove forward to be about 20 feet from where he stands. "Takashi, saeko, hirano. Watch the back of the vehicle. I want none of you to watch me for a couple minutes. Shizuka, saya, rei, turn around and don't look back" Everyone nodded and did as he instructed them. Once he saw that no one was looking he turned to face <B>them</B>. Makoto then put one hand on the ground and in a poof of smoke mika appeared. She looked around wide eyed "I didn't think that this world would have an outbreak of this caliber." Makoto nodded his head and stabbed his sword in the ground then went through some hand seals. Once he stopped at the dragon seal he placed one hand on the ground and a summing seal appeared, but then spread to do the same with his sword.</P><P>In a poof of smoke a woman appeared in front of the sword. She looked 5'9 in height with DD cup breast. She had crimson hair with white highlights, crimson colored eyes, and heart shaped face. She wore a kimono that had the same design as makoto's and traditional sandals. <B>(like jiraya's) </B>"It's been a while since you summoned me, makoto" said the woman "That is has, midori" said makoto. Midori looked around "Why can't you just summon me to talk. Last time you were fighting a bunch of elemental dragons and some omega shinron. I hate how arrogant he was until how much he graveled at your feet when you were about to kill him." Makoto looked sheepish "Sorry, I need your help with these guys. They are a little hard to kill and are very strong. If you get bit don't worry you're healing will heal it but you will feel slightly tired. Will you accept these terms and help us?"</P><P>Midori looked thoughtful for a second "Ok, I will help on one condition. You have to summon me later when you're not fighting so you and me can hang out." Makoto nodded "Ok, well you two take the other side I will take this one. You all know the rules so I want this done before sun down." Both said "Hai" and appeared at the other side of the bridge." Makoto turned to around to make sure that no one was watching and saw hirano take out a couple undead while takashi was talking to rei and saeko was making sure that nothing got to close. He say shizuka and saya in a conversation and turned around. He looked up "This is for you, alice" and that started the massacre. 30 minutes later they heard a faint "Turn around" and saw makoto and two others standing at the end of the bridge of a bloody bridge.</P><P>They drove over to them and they jumped on the top of the vehicle. Makoto peaked his head through the top "Just follow where rei says to go to her house, shizuka-chan." "Who are those two women, makoto-kun?" asked shizuka. "They are my sword spirit and the 10 tailed demon sealed inside me I told you about a couple years ago." Shizuka nodded and followed rei's instructions to her house. On the way there they heard snoring and looked up to see the gold haired girl sleeping on the opening. They all sweat dropped and ignored her so not to provoke her wrath. Once they arrived at her house makoto and the two girls jumped down "Wait here, we will check it out. I don't want you to see anything if there dead." They nodded and watched as they walked in the house. After about 5 minutes a body was thrown through the window of the second story, and flew through the window of the house across the street.</P><P>Then a couple minutes later the group came out with sad faces. Makoto asked rei to come out and stand in front of her. "I am sorry, but your parents were found dead. They were surrounded by <B>them </B>and both had gunshot wounds to the head. I believe they suicide so that they wouldn't turn into them and hurt you or anyone." Rei looked down and started to shake so makoto hugged her as she cried. As she was crying a couple of <B>them </B>appeared and the two women from earlier killed them. After 10 minutes of crying makoto tried to put her in the vehicle but she just clung to him "Please let me stay with you for now." Makoto sighed and picked her up bridal style and jumped on the top of the vehicle along with the other two girls.</P><P>"Shizuka-chan, go to the house down the street and we will stop there and rest for tonight." Shizuka nodded and headed to the large house down the street. When they got closer they noticed it was a very simple blue wood two story house with a two door garage. Once shizuka pulled up the girls jumped down and walked in the house while makoto stayed back to talk to everyone. "I must warn you. Do not provoke those girls or they will severly hurt you. The blonde is midore and the silver haired one is mika. Now I am going to set rei one of the rooms and the rest of you take what you want. Shizuka-chan you will sleep with me and the other girls." They all nodded and headed into the house.</P><P>After makoto set a sleeping rei down in a bed he went to see how everyone else was doing. He walked down stairs to see the entire group in the living room talking. He looked around to see shizuka sitting in a chair in the corner of the house with her knees to her chest and staring at nothing with a far off look in her eyes. He walked up to her and shook her shoulder and she turned to him with a surprised look. "I thought that you left again" she said with tears welling up in her eyes. He tilted his head "Why's that?" "Because the last time those girls appeared you said you were leaving, and this time I thought you left without telling me." He got down on his knees and looked at her "I would never leave you without telling you. I promise even if I die I will come and tell you."</P><P>Then he hugged her and disappeared and all everyone noticed was a gust of wind that blew through the house. Shizuka opened her eyes to see that they were on top of the house. Makoto set her down and sat next to her placing his hand on hers. She looked out at the sunset and leaned on his shoulder and he set his head on hers. "I have to leave tonight but I will be back the next day" said makoto. Shizuka sat up and looked at him "Why!? You said that you would come back! Now that your back you leave!" Makoto put a hand on her shoulder "I will be back before you wake up. The other dimension is daytime in your nighttime. I will just leave a little early so you can wake up with me here. I promise and I never break my promise."</P><P>"Don't worry, we will make sure that he comes back" said midore and mika simultaneously. Shizuka smiled at them "Thank you." Makoto then said "These are the other ladies that I told you are my mates." Shizuka nodded her head "I kinda figured that when you left with them." Makoto smiled, kissed her on the lips, and laid down on the roof. Shizuka cuddled up next to him and midore came up and laid on the other side and mika laid next to shizuka. "Well we can lay like this for a few minutes then we have to go" said makoto. "Oh! I have an idea!" said mika. "Why don't we just bring shizuka along with us? She can just sleep here when we get back." Shizuka looked at makoto excitedly "Really?! I can go with you?!" Makoto continued to stare for a minute before turning to smile at shizuka.</P><P>"Sure, I will go tell the others then we will leave. If you're coming I need to show you around a bit and show you what can happen before everyone starts to wake up. I need to warn you this dimension is completely different from yours. They are hundreds of times more powerful that the people here, even stronger than <B>them</B>. Will you be able to handle that?" he asked. Shizuka turned serious "Yes, I know I can handle it. I am immortal and I have you three by my side." Makoto smiled at her, nodded his head, and got up. "You two get her things and meet me at the front of the property. I will tell everyone where we are going and seal up the house so no one or thing can get in." They nodded and headed to shizuka's room to pack her things and makoto disappeared.</P><P>Everyone was about to go to bed until makoto appeared in the middle of the room. "Everyone, me, shizuka, midore, and mika will be going to another dimension for tonight. The other is day time in your night time. We will be back before you all wake up, and don't worry about<B> them</B>. I will place a seal on the property of this house so that they can't get in." "So just you, those two girls, and shizuka will go" said saya. Makoto nodded "I will place seals so you all can get good nights sleep knowing that nothing will happen. I will even make a clone that never dies so that even if the seals fail he will be here to kill it." Everyone nodded their heads in agreement and he disappeared and reappeared in front of the house. He went through some hand seals and placed his hand on the ground and watched as seals covered the house's perimeter.</P><P>He got up and turned to the ladies standing behind him "Well let's get out of here." He told them all to place a hand on his shoulder then started to go through hand seals and then lightning struck them and they were gone.</P><P><B>Well that's chapter 5. It took me all day to write this. I skipped breakfast and luch and had a late dinner and stayed up till midnight to finish this for you guys I hope you all liked it and please review and tell me how you did. </B></P>

She turned to the right to see makoto and midore. Looking to her left she saw mika looking at makoto waiting for him to say something. She turned back to makoto and he said "Well we are in the forest outside of konoha. We will scale the wall and go the apartment and meet up with naruto before we go show shizuka-chan around the village." Everyone nodded and followed him about 50 yards to see a giant wood wall. Makoto picked up shizuka bridal style and started to run up the wall with midore and mika following right behind him.</P><P>Once they reached the top he pushed them off to land on top of a building and jumped again and to the next one far ahead of them. After about 5 minutes of jumping they stopped on top of what looked like a apartment. Makoto set shizuka down and motioned for her to follow him. He walked in a door and down stairs with the girls following him. He reached narutos apartment and opened the door silently and walked in. He walked into naruto's room and to see just hitome and rei sleeping there.</P><P>Then he felt cold steel against his throat "Hello, naruto. It's been a while since I have seen you." The sword was removed from his throat "Makoto? Where they hell have you been?" "I have been at another dimension taking care of it because something happened that weren't supposed to. Besides I was only gone for the end of the day and most of the night." Naruto nodded "OK, well you can at least leave a note telling us where you will be." Makoto nodded his head "OK next time I will. Wake the girls up and tell them to meet us on the roof." Naruto nodded and went to wake the girls up as makoto headed to the roof with his girls in tow.</P><P>After a few minutes of waiting shizuka saw three people come through the door and walked around the tree to get makoto. Before she touched him he spoke "I know there here." And stood up. When he stood up midore and mika, that were meditating next to him, stood up as well. They walked around the tree and both midore and mika were tackled to the ground by hitome and rei while both said "Midore-sama/mika-sama!" Midore hugged rei "Hey, it's been a while rei. I haven't seen you in a while." While mika said "It has been a while since I've seen you as well hitome." Makoto turned serious "I know you havn't seen each other in a while but rei and hitome have to go to the academy and midore and mika will be with me showing shizuka-chan around and teaching her somethings. We can hang out tomorrow right now is all business."</P><P>They saw the serious look on his face, got up, dusted themselves off and stood next to naruto. "Now this is shizuka marikawa, my girlfriend at the current time." He wrapped and arm around shizuka's waist and pulled her close "and maybe something more later on." Shizuka blushed at the last comment and started to stutter. Everyone smiled at how nice and warm he was acting to her as they know that he almost never acts like this to anyone. Makoto turned his head around to see the sun coming up "Well naruto, rei, and hitome need to go to the academy. Midore and mika take shizuka to find some clothes for today and ones she can train in, and meet me at the hokage tower. I need to talk to hiruzen and jiraiya about some things. Everyone understand what to do?" He saw everyone nodded their heads and shattered into crimson and black leaves and they flew in the wind towards the hokage tower, while everyone else left to go about their business.</P><P>Hiruzen was doing fighting the bain of all leaders of anything. PAPER WORK. Then he heard a knock on his window and thanking kami for giving him a break.</P><P><U>God's Realm</U></P><P>Kami listened to what hiruzen said and laughed. "Hahahaha! I am only giving you a break before my son is about to beat the shit out of your student and berate you for looking at his girlfriend. I am just setting up the pieces so that they fall together perfectly."</P><P><U>Konoha</U></P><P>As jiraiya hopped in through the window both him and hiruzen felt a feeling of dread wash over them but shrugged it off. "So sensei, what did you want me here for?" asked jiraiya. "I want you here to meet someone." Then they watched as crimson and black leaves flew in the open window and started swirl and a figure appeared. When the leaves died down it showed a man in a black cloak with crimson leaves on it that seemed to move. He has black hair with crimson highlights and the right eye had a cut on it. The other eye was red with black slits going diagnol and horizontal and a black ring that had tome in each space. "Hello hiruzen, jiraiya. I haven't seen you two in a while. Especially you jiraiya how is your spy network going?"asked the man. "Fine, thank you for your concern, but what is your name?"</P><P>The man chuckled "Forgive me, I completely forgot my manners. I am makoto urahara, naruto's sensei for the past 3 years." Jiraiya nodded his head before he pulled out a bingo book and flipped through it. Once he got to the last page his eyes grew to the size of dinner plates, and dropped the book. "What?" asked hiruzen. "Makoto urahara, I knew I heard that name somewhere. The bingo book was made just to inform people about you and others that were insanely strong. You were the first person to ever be put in the bingo book, and the strongest in there. He is called the creator as it is rumored that he created this world and the demon world as well.</P><P>He is a 21 tailed demon with juubi sealed inside of him. He know all justu ever created and no one can match his speed, power, or knowledge. He has a 21 S-rank on him, one for each tail he has. He has a kneel on sight order, as no one can run from him. He hasn't been seen in so long so some people just think that he is a myth, legend, or dead." Hiruzen just looked shocked at what he said while makoto narrowed his eyes. "Is that an old copy of the bingo book?" Jiraiya nodded "Yes, why?" "I told the maker of the bingo books to take my name out of it. I think he didn't but I guess it doesn't matter now. Now I came here to introduce myself to jiraiya and let you both know some things. First is I need hiruzen to not baby naruto when he asks for things. He is stronger than you and jiraiya combined. Second is a blonde woman that will be here off and on. She is my girlfriend so if anyone hurts her or peeks on her they will be severely hurt or dead. They should be here any second now."</P><P>As soon as he finished the sentence the door opened to reveal three women that went and stood next to makoto. The blonde haired woman looked the hottest in their opinion. She was standing She was wearing a mesh shirt with a black shirt over it with a black navy blue trench coat that reached her ankles in length. She was also wearing black ANBU style pants with black ninja sandals. She had long blonde hair that reached her thighs and E-cup breast, and a innocent face. "Hello, my name is shizuka marikawa, and it is nice to meet you."</P><P>Both suppressed the urge to fly back with nosebleeds or face makoto wrath. The next was standing next to shizuka and had crimson colored hair with black highlights in her hair. She was about 5'9 and had DD-cup breast and a heart shaped face. She was wearing a kimono that was exactly like makoto's and sandals that were like jiraiya. She bowed her head slightly "Hello, my name is midore nice to meet you both." Both nodded their heads back in respect.</P><P>The last girl was standing on the other side of makoto. She had silver colored hair and was 5'7 in height. She had DD-cup breast and a heart shaped face. She was wearing a gold kimono with red phoenixes on it that seemed to move around, and sandals like jiraiya's as well. She did a full bow "Greetings, jiraiya-san, hirusen-san. It is nice to finally meet you both." Both of the guys bowed their heads in respect towards her. "Now here are some rules for these girls. If they are attacked by anyone of this village I will first give them a warning depending on what and how they attacked. If I find out that jiraiya peeks on any of these women I promise that you will no longer existence. Trust me we can live without you jiraiya. I could have naruto or midore run the network if I kill you. Are these rules understood?" asked makoto.</P><P>Both of them nodded and hiruzen cleared his throat before speaking "I will inform my ANBU of the rules on these girls and they will have a kill on site order if anyone attacks them if you are not here. I will also put a privacy barrier over the hot springs so that nothing can happen ever again." Makoto nodded his head and jiraiya mentally cried at how he won't be able to peep on women here anymore. "Well that's all I needed to say on that matter. We will be using training ground 7 to start on shizuka's training. She is not a ninja so she will need to be watched more by your ANBU when no one is around that can protect her. I think that people hate anyone that associates with me or naruto. I also wanted to ask how the academy was coming along with their students."</P><P>Hiruzen smiled "Fine, actually I heard that sasuke and naruto were getting along. Sadly none of the girls are getting along at all. Naruto and sasuke have to constantly separate them or knock them out so that they stop fighting. I have even stood in class and sakura started to pick a fight with rei on who sits next to sasuke but sasuke told her to shut up and naruto just held rei by her waist and they both quieted down. I am told that this is a daily occence. I wish I knew what was wrong but I have no idea." Makoto nodded his head "I understand what you are saying, and I know what is wrong here. Sakura in jealous of anyone who sits next to sasuke because she wants to be noticed but he never pays attention. The reason sasuke doesn't pay attention is because he hasn't found someone he can truly open up to besides naruto. If they are friends then sasuke told naruto about his hardships and naruto told sasuke about his. The only way to stop them is for sakura and ino to realize that sasuka doesn't like them and never will. I already know who he will like and he will meet her on his first A-rank mission. So don't worry about those girls as long as naruto is getting along with everyone its fine. Now I have someone to train so bye" and he grabbed shizuka bridal style and jumped out the still opened the window.</P><P>As soon as he left midore and mika followed him towards the training ground. "Man, I wish that there were fine girls like that in the world that were strong and weren't demons or from other worlds" said jiraiya. Hiruzen looked at him shocked "How do you know she is from another world?" "Simple, the way she carries herself. She is scared of everything here and was hoping that no one noticed. While she introduced herself she had that look in her eyes that said that she didn't belong here. You may be older sensei but I was just paying more attention that usually because she just looked suspicious. Well I have to go and meet up with some spies in Ame. I hear that someone killed hanzo but I have to see it to believe it" and jumped out the window.</P><P>Hiruzen turned around and sighed "Now back to paperwork, yay. I wonder if my ANBU are watching maybe I can burn this really quick." Once of the hidden ANBU coughed to show that he was there and hiruzen just glared from where the cough came from. He mumbled something and went back to doing the paperwork.</P><P>Once they arrived at the training ground makoto turned to the girls. "Ok, we will be training shizuka-chan but just in the basics so that she can protect herself if a ninja or civilian attacks in this world. The other reason is so that she can fight more in her world, and train others in the basics so that they can defend themselves when I am not there. First we will teach you how to access your chakra. Put this leaf to your forehead and concentrate on it. I want to see if you have any reserves to begin with." He handed her a leaf and she placed it on her head and made what looked like a concentration face. She held the leaf on her forehead for about a minute until it fell and she started to pant.</P><P>"Wow, I never expected you to keep the leaf on your forehead that long. Most academy students can keep it on about the same time, and they have been doing it for a while now. That really good shizuka-chan" praised makoto and shizuka blushed at the praise she was given by him. "Now I want you to do that until you can at least do it for at least 10 minutes. It would normally take at least a day to do this but I put some time and space seals on this area so that time has no affect on us. We are basically suspended in time and no time is passing outside. I am going to talk to kakashi so you girls just help her anyway you can, I wil be back shortly" and he shattered into crimson and black leaves and they floated away in the wind.</P><P>Kakashi was just entering the training ground and he felt a little different when he walked in but ignored it and kept walking. Once he reached the memorial stone he noticed the wind picked up behind him and he turned to see crimson and black leaves circling and the it stopped to reveal a cloaked figure. He had on a black cloak with crimson leaves on it that seemed to move and had on black combat boots. His face was angular and had a cut on his right eye like his and the other had a strange design in it. It was a slit that went diagonal and horizontal with a ring that had tome in each space.</P><P>"Hello, kakashi my name is makoto. I was just coming here to talk to you." Kakashi just stared wide eyed at the man "Y-y-your m-m-makoto U-ura-urahara. You're the strongest being in this world and m-many others." Then he kneeled down "Forgive me for not kneeling." Makoto waved his hand "It's fine, now stand. Not many people know who I am or believe that it's actually me but I don't attack unless the situation gives me reason to. Now I just came to apologize to you." Kakashi stood with his single eye wide open "Apologize for what?" "For not being there to help you with rin. I know she had something in her genes that kiri wanted but you had to kill her so that they didn't get it. I actually wanted to offer you something, I wanted to see if you would like to help in killing obito. His mind was shattered when he saw you kill rin so he lost it and is making an organization to help him take over the world. He is wearing a black cloak with an orange mask, so if you see him you contact me with a seal I will give you later. Now do you want to help me or not, I don't really care either way."</P><P>Kakashi thought over for a minute "Sure, but I don't know if I could face him right now. I may be strong but I couldn't take all of those kiri nin that were left. I would like to but I was wondering if you could train me in something that I lack." Makoto nodded his head "Sure, I can even change your blood so that you have uchiha blood and the sharingan in the other eye. Then I will leave you with some scrolls to train with and make sure that you get a sword to use as you will need one. Now I going to change your blood and give you the sharingan. You will be bed ridden for a few days and won't be able to see for a few either. After a few days take off the bandages and you will have your normal eyes and to activate your sharingan just channel chakra to you eye's. Both will be back to stage one so you will have to train hard to them back to stage three. Now meet me at the hospital in room 4A in 30 minutes and have someone you trust there to watch over you and help you move around until you can see."</P><P>Kakashi nodded and disappeared in a swirl of leaves and makoto walked up to the memorial stone. He stopped at the names Minato namikaze and kushina uzumaki. "Don't worry I will take care of your son and we will meet soon." He sighed and disappeared leaving only an after image. 30 minutes later makoto opened the door to the hospital room to see kakashi leaning on the wall reading a little orange book with a purple haired woman sitting on the bed looking out the window. "Hello kakahsi, I see you brought yugao to watch over you. How is life yugao?" Yugao smiled "Fine, kakashi-sempai already explained what is happening and who are. I needed a break anyway some dating troubles." Makoto nodded his head "I know and why don't you just date kakashi?" Yugao blushed and looked away "I couldn't date my captain, it's wrong." "No it's not I am dating my subordante, two actually. There's nothing wrong with it in this line of work. He isn't even that much older than you and the blush you have says that you like him. Give it a try, it won't hurt anything."</P><P>Yugao turned to kakashi "Um w-what do you t-think about this k-kakashi-sempai?" Kakashi closed his book knowing this was not a time to be reading it "I would think that giving it a try wouldn't hurt. So I see nothing wrong with it but it's up to you, will you go out with me?" Yugao gained a heavy blush but looked thoughtful for a minute then she said "Ok, I guess we can try it and see what happens." Makoto smiled at the two "Well I'm happy for you both but I am here for a reason." Yugao got up and sat in a chair next to the bed while kakashi laid down in said bed. Makoto walked up to kakashi and started to go through hand seals faster that they could follow "Now you will pass out the instant this starts so you won't feel most of the pain." He stopped at the ram hand sign and placed a hand on kakashi's chest and he passed out. After watching kakashi for about 5 minutes black chakra surrounded his body and yugao started to get scared. "Don't worry it's my chakra infusing the uchiha blood in him and is trying to change is other eye so it is having a bit of trouble since it is encountering other DNA that the other eye which is uchiha" insured makoto.</P><P>Once the chakra died down yugao sighed in happiness. "Well he will be out until tomorrow and will be bed ridden for a few days. After that he won't be able to remove the bandages for a day after he can move. I have rented this room for three days so you have plenty of time here if need be. Now I must be off" and disappeared leaving only an after image. Makoto appeared at the training ground to see shizuka, midore, and mika sitting on a tree branch 100 feet in the air. "So I take it shizuka mastered tree walking?" All of the girls' nodded their head "Not really surprising since it has been three days' time in here but only one hour out there. So did she learn any jutsu yet?" asked makoto. Midore and mika jumped down while shizuka just slid down the tree using a small amount of chakra to slid down in but not enough to stop her and her walk up it. Once shizuka got down midore spoke "No but she learned medical jutsu and is a natural at it. Right now she could give tsunade a run for her money in a fight as she can use chakra to make her punches stronger and can run faster by channeling chakra into them. I figured that we could teach her a few jutsu when she comes back here because she wanted to learn as much medical stuff before going back to her world."</P><P>Makoto nodded his head "Well I never expected her to get that good in medical field for a while. I guess since she is already a medic she know a lot of the basics she just has to add chakra to make it better. The rules in her world keep her from using jutsu but she can use enough to make her strength and speed better." Makoto went through hand seals and they felt a little different afterwards. "What was that makoto-kun?" asked shizuka. "I just released the barrier over the training ground. Naruto and the academy students should be going outside soon to have a spar. I figured since shizuka's training was coming along so nicely that we could go and watch some matches, and after that we could all go get something to eat." The girls thought this over and all nodded their heads in agreement. Makoto saw that everyone was ready to go and took off towards the academy and the girls following him all the way there.</P><P>Once they arrived they noticed that no one was there. They waited a few minutes until they saw that everyone was walking out of the main entrance. "Well I guess that they don't have sparring today. I was sure that they did but I guess something happened. I will just ask naruto what happened" and jumped off the roof the main entrance of the academy. The girls saw him jump off and followed him and walked to be beside him with shizuka and midore on either side and mika on the other side of shizuka for protection.</P><P>Naruto was talking to hitome about where to eat until he noticed makoto out of the corner of his eye. He turned and started to walk to him with hitome, and rei following him. Naruto walked up to makoto and said "Hey, what are you doing here?" "We were here to watch you guys spar then go get something to eat but I guess no spar today." "Yeah, well sakura and rei got in a fight then I fought kiba so we didn't get to have a spar today" said naruto. "Well let's go to ichiraku's and get some ramen. I don't think that shizuka-chan has had ramen this good before." Naruto and the girls nodded and they all walked to ichiraku's. Half way there they saw sasuke being chased by a horde of fan girls so before they noticed them they all disappeared along with sasuke.</P><P>Sasuke was running from fan girls one moment the next he saw them pass by from a rooftop. He turned to see naruto, rei, hitome, what looked like makoto from what naruto decribed and three girls he didn't know. "Um thanks for saving me. I think that the one with crimson leaves on his cloak in makoto from what naruto has told me but I don't know the other three girls." Makoto pointed to shizuka "That's shizuka marikawa." Then pointed to midore "That's midore" then pointed to mika "And that's mika. The last two are my mates and the first is my girlfriend." Sasuke nodded his head "Nice to meet you all." The girls all bowed their heads slightly "Nice to meet you as well sasuke." Makoto then teleported everyone to the street "We are going to ichiraku's, want to join us?" Sasuke shrugged "Sure, I was just going to my compound anyway. I don't have any family so there's nothing to do except train, hanging out with friends for a change would be nice."</P><P>Then the group continued walking to ichiraku's. After they ordered and started to eat they all heard "There you are sasuke-kun!" and sasuke was tackled to the ground by a pink haired girl. "Sakura, get off me" said sasuke clearly angry at her. Sakura got off him and turned to the others "You kidnapped sasuke-kun didn't you? I know naruto and his group doesn't care for him but I think that the one with crimson leaves and the other girls sluts of his probably want to brainwash him!" That's when sakura was thrown to the ground outside of ichiraku's and made a small crater with the force which with she was thrown. Before she could even attempt to get up she felt a blade against her neck and looked up to see the man with crimson leaves on his cloak pointing a sword at her. "If you ever call my girlfriends or any girl that is my friend that I will not hesitate to kill you. Do you understand?" asked makoto glaring at her though his one opened eye. Sakura gulped and just nodded her head knowing that he was completely serious. Makoto let his sword shatter into black and crimson leaves and fuse back into his cloak, and walked back into the ramen bar.</P><P>"Sorry about that, I thought we lost her" said sasuke. Makoto waved it off "It's fine, I understand your pain. I had the same problem but with a different person which will not be told until I trust you all more." Once everyone finished they all stood outside of the ramen bar. "Well I have to stay be in the other dimension shortly so I will see you all later." He jumped away and midore, shizuka, and mika followed. "Well sasuke we will see you at the academy" said naruto walking back to his house. Sasuke just nodded his head and started to walk to his clan compound. Makoto and the girls stopped jumping and stood in the forest outside of konoha. "Well everyone put a hand on my shoulder, we have to make it back to shizuka-chan's dimension before anyone wakes up." All of the girls put a hand on his shoulder and they all disappeared in a flash of lightning.</P><P><B>Well this is the longest chapter yet, and I hoped you all enjoyed it.
