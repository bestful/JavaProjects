smiled as he felt her arms wrap around him and her breasts press into
his back. It had taken a while for him to get used to having a ten
thousand year old fox demon living inside his body with him, but once
he got used to it and managed to transfer her soul over to his axe,
he barely spent a moment without her. Ever since he first met her
when he was 5 she had been nothing but kind to him, he didn't care
that she was a demon, and she didn't care that he wasn't very
socially knowledgeable, but they managed. Naruto was fifteen now, and
he was expected to join the academy for the last year.</p><p>Hokage-jiji
had been shocked when Naruto had said that he didn't want to join
the academy and wanted to train on his own, but the old man assumed
it would be better this way as he wouldn't have people trying to
hold him back all the time, so he allowed it and gave Naruto the Kage
Bunshin jutsu which allowed Naruto to train his body while his cloned
gathered information and read up on things in the library. This was
what it was like for the last ten years, since the Hokage had decided
that after the Itachi incident the ages were going to be put up for
the academy as he couldn't risk any more genius's going crazy and
killing people. Naruto had mainly spent most of his time increasing
his speed, strength, and weaponry, along with a lot of chakra control
due to him gaining a vast majority of Kyuubi's reserves a long with
his own chaotic chakra.</p><p>Naruto
unfortunately managed to look good enough to have a whole fan club of
girls, he usually wore black ANBU BDU's along with steel toed shin
height boots and some crimson armor over his long sleeved black tee
shirt. He also wore a sleeveless crimson trench coat to hide some of
his more extravagant weaponry and a pair of crimson gloves with
armoured knuckles and some crimson arm bracers. Naruto found that he
didn't really care but his Kyu-hime said that she liked it, so he
would wear it just for her. He was thinking of asking the big
question soon, he knew he had nothing to lose as they were already
pretty much together for eternity anyway, since Naruto was pretty
much immortal and so was Kyuubi. Yes, Naruto was a Hanyou, he had
made the deal with Kyuubi when he was eight that he would help free
her and she would never leave him, he didn't expect her to turn him
into a half demon just so she could literally make it never, but he
liked it. He slowly turned around to face her and wrapped his tails
around her back. He sighed into her blood red hair and whispered in
his deep masculine voice.</p><p>"I
missed you Kyu-hime." She responded by moving her head to the crook
of his neck and nuzzling him. Naruto sighed it was now or never he
guessed. "Hey Kyu-hime, listen, you know how I feel about you and
you know that I love you more than life itself and I would do
absolutely anything for you right?" Kyuubi moved up on her tiptoes
to kiss him on the lips and nodding in the affirmative. "Well, I
was wondering if you'd do me the honour of having you as my mate?"
Kyuubi squealed</p><p>before
lightly biting Naruto on the crook of his neck before he proceed to
do the same to her.</p><p>"I
thought you'd never ask Naru-chan." Her sweet seductive voice
said.</p><p>"I
didn't want you to think I didn't mean it baby, I wanted to wait
until it felt just right, besides you know I only just got enough
status for it to be legal in the demon world sweetie."</p><p>"Yes I
know my sweet eight tailed fox." Her cute voice rung out with a
laugh.</p><p>"I don't
want to go to the academy Kyu, I wont be able to spend as much time
with you." Naruto whined. Kyuubi snuggled up to him further and
sighed.</p><p>"Don't
worry you can ignore class and spend time with me and I'll
regurgitate the important parts to you afterwards okay?" She smiled
serenely.</p><p>"I knew
there was a reason I loved you." He smiled. "Apart from all the
other great stuff of course." He added in response to her look. She
laughed and hit him with a tail. He responded in kin and soon a
full-grown tail war was going on inside her place in his mind, with
Naruto being thoroughly beaten of course. He may have only been one
tail less then her in power, so she was about twice as strong as him
in raw strength, but she had him beaten hands down in experience, as
she had been around a lot longer.</p><p>Naruto
sighed contentedly as Kyuubi pinned him to the floor with her tails
as he looked up into her deep crimson slitted eyes as she lay on top
of him leaving their tails entwined. "Kyu-hime what do you think I
should train in before I start the academy tomorrow?" He asked.</p><p>"Train
with your axe Naru-chan, I could use a nice work out my love, and
those centipede demons are trying to sneak up on our home again."</p><p>"Damn
centipedes, I spent ages building this house away from the villagers
in this forest so I wouldn't be bothered and the damn low level
demons think I'm weak!" He sighed and exited Kyuubi's area of
his mind and returned to the outside world before getting up off the
floor and walking outside. He channelled chakra into the seal in his
gauntlets and proceeded to summon his battle-axe. He couldn't carry
it around as he was tall for his age, due to Kyuubi forcing him to
eat a healthy supply of meet and his demon blood, but he was still
only six foot and his axe was eight foot from tip to end. The handle
itself was 5 and a half-foot and the blade was 2 and a half. The
blade of the axe was shaped like a crescent moon and had tiny spikes
coming off it that would tear into the target. The blade itself had
seals all over it, which Naruto knew to be holy seals, it was one of
the only reasons he was able to put Kyuubi's soul inside of it. He
also had absolutely no idea why he could touch it, as no demon should
be able to, and he still remembered the day that he found the axe in
a shrine deep beneath the Hokage Mountain. Kyuubi had said it once
belonged to an angel who did the work of God, but Naruto still
refused to show anybody else but Anko it as he knew he could trust
her and he didn't want anybody recognising it just in case.</p><p>He loved
his weapon so much, he never wanted to go anywhere without it so he
sent Kage Bunshin after Kage Bunshin to learn enough about sealing so
he could seal it into his gloves. Naruto sighed as he beheaded the
centipede demons, he didn't really care because most people knew
this was Anko's forest and they knew someone else came here and
also knew that Anko didn't care so they guessed this person was
even more blood thirsty than her, so they tended to leave the forest
alone. Naruto sighed as he sealed away his precious axe and
remembered that the Hokage had asked to see him today before he
jumped up into the canopy and quickly ran his way out of the forest.</p><p>Naruto
pumped more chakra into his gravity seal as he walked through town so
he would appear slower and as a worse shinobi. He knew he had to act
like a bad shinobi until he could get out of the academy because
until then he'd be under the rule of the civilian council but once
he was a shinobi he'd be under the rule of the Hokage. Naruto
sighed at all the cold looks he still received before jumping up onto
the roof of one of the nearby buildings by channelling chakra into
his feet and legs as he sprinted off towards the window of the
Hokage's office.</p><p>Naruto
sighed at the old man reading Icha Icha from the balcony before
sliding open the door to his office with a saying</p><p>"Hey
Hokage-jiji, those books aren't all that great you know." The old
man laughed before turning around as he knew Naruto was no threat
since he hadn't been hiding his chakra source, not that the aged
Hokage knew he could, but that's unimportant.</p><p>"Now
Naruto, I bet you're wondering why I called you here today hmm?"
The Old man asked after he had put away his book and started puffing
on his pipe.</p><p>"Yes sir
I was wondering that." Naruto replied as he sat in one of the
chairs in front of the Sandaime's Desk.</p><p>"Well
Naruto, what do you know about the Kyuubi?" The old man asked with
trepidation in his voice. Naruto was confused as he could sense that
he wasn't the only person in the room with the Hokage and couldn't
understand why the old man would talk about this with someone else
here.</p><p>"You
know someone else is here too right? I'm surprised you can't
sense it." The Hokage's eyes went wide as he threw a kunai into
the corner of the room towards where he felt the presence now that he
was looking. The sound of a kunai hitting flesh and the sound of a
moan as the intruder removed the kunai. Then the sound of soft
cursing as the genjutsu the person had used to hide dispelled itself
due to the pain revealing a tall dark skinned silver haired and white
eyed woman wearing a pair of black BDU's and purple armor with
nothing else but two giant silver wings coming out of her shoulder
blades. She had a wingspan of about 12 feet total and her feathers
were all immaculately kept. She tried to step forward but found the
end of an eight foot axe at her neck being held on to with one hand
by a growling blonde.</p><p>"Who are
you and what are you doing here?" The old man asked after getting
over the fact that his young charge was holding a huge weapon single
handed. The woman phased out of view from the corner and quickly
phased back in behind Naruto and whispered in his ear with a husky
voice.</p><p>"Like my
axe child?" Naruto's eyes went wide as he sealed the axe back
into his glove now knowing that this woman would harm the Hokage,
only himself and that was if she could figure out he was a hanyou.
Naruto smiled and replied.</p><p>"Yes, it
really is a masterpiece of work you know." Naruto pulled out the
chair for the angel and waited for her to wrap her wings around
herself and sit before he sat down in his own next to her. "What
brings you back to Kohona Tenshi-chan?"</p><p>"Kami-sama
told me to train her half breed champion." She bluntly replied.</p><p>"I would
prefer if you did not call me half breed, mortal loving slut."
Naruto hissed.</p><p>"I only
repeat her words defiler, if you dislike it, complain to Kami-sama."
Naruto stopped glaring at her and started glaring at the sky and
growling instead, before Kyuubi gave him a mental bop on the head for
being rude. Naruto grumbled amusedly.</p><p>"My
apologies Kami-sama." He then turned back to the angel and spoke.
"What is it you shall be training me in Tenshi-teme?" She was
about to open her mouth to reply when she was interrupted, both
smiled sheepishly having forgotten the old man was there.</p><p>"Can
someone explain to me what is going on?" He asked after taking
another puff on his pipe as he smiled. The angel smiled at him and
replied.</p><p>"At
least one of you is polite." Before she casts a dark look at
Naruto. "I'm here to train the user of the axe that the child
has, It's a holy weapon so I don't know a disgusting demon like
him can even bare to be near it but we'll figure that out later I
suppose. Kami decided that for some reason this half breed was
important in the grand scheme of things even if we don't like
working with his kind." The old man glared at her.</p><p>"His
kind? Excuse me but he is not the demon you seem to think he is.
Naruto is not the Kyuubi and I will not have you calling him such in
my village." He sternly replied.</p><p>"Shows
how much you know old man, he is no longer the container of the
Kyuubi, he made a deal with her and transferred her soul over to my
axe and she made him half fox demon, I cant believe someone with such
a pure heart would bargain with a disgusting thing like her and
willingly become like her, even if you didn't know what she meant
by forever its no excuse. That thing is defiling my precious axe!"
She shouted, before mumbling. "Even if she never really was all
that bad for a demon anyway."</p><p>"We're
not all bloodthirsty maniacs you know!"</p><p>"You
should have just waited till your afterlife, You could have been an
Angel instead of a half breed demon!"</p><p>"What's
the difference?"</p><p>"Demons
kill angels!" She screamed, getting closer to his face than was
comfortable.</p><p>"Angels
kill demons!" He screamed back.</p><p>"Angels
get wings!"</p><p>"Demons
get tails!"</p><p>"Angels
don't kill random people." She snarled.</p><p>"Neither
do I or Kyu-hime." He growled.</p><p>"Angels
don't have to fight all the time to survive!"</p><p>"I like
fighting because I'm not a pacifist woman." They were now almost
on top of each other growling and snarling at each other while the
Sandaime just watched on confused about what was going on, all he
seemed to understand so far was that Naruto was a demon and angels
and demons apparently don't like each other. He knew he could trust
Naruto since he had apparently been half demon for a long time and
hadn't snapped yet. The angel pushed Naruto backwards before
unfurling her wings and glaring at him. Naruto managed to draw
himself up to full height and released his demon illusion showing all
8 of his tails claws, slitted eyes as well as removing his gravity
seal and unsealing his axe in the process. It was at this point the
Sandaime decided to intervene before his office and the rest of
Kohona was destroyed.</p><p>"Okay so
why don't you both go train somewhere, now Naruto as you obviously
know of the Kyuubi then I suggest that you listen to me now. I bought
you a small manor house up on top of the Hokage Mountain so you don't
have to leave the forest to get to class. You're in room 201
tomorrow at nine and don't be late Naruto. If you go up there you
can get settled and it should be fine if you take the lovely woman
with you so I can actually do some work." He stood and shooed both
of them out of the office after they replaced their illusions, before
sitting at his desk and muttering. "I'll figure this out later,
its Icha Icha time!" He was knocked out of his musings by the sight
of his smiling secretary coming in with a large pile of paperwork.</p>
