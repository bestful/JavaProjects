clean out his attic and I accidentally fell down the stairs and had a
box of old CD's land on me! No, it didn't strike me with sudden
inspiration. However, a CD fell out of the box and it happened to be
Iron Maiden's "it's a live one" album!</P><P>I asked if I could have it, because
I hadn't heard iron maiden before (I blame society and wal-mart not
having good stocks.) so anyway, I have recently become an iron maiden
fan! And my favorite song you ask? "Fear of the Dark" of course! And it was at 3am lounging upon my computer chair and spinning in
circles whilst absently feeling around for those damn cookies I left
at the desk that this story came to me!</P><P>Really, I should start writing
outside the Naruto genre… I hate most of the Naruto cast and see a
great many flaws with the entire show, but they just fit so well into
my nefarious machinations!</P><P>Like I hinted at (not so subtly) in
my last update of NES, I will be writing up a Disgaea fic sooner or
later. It will probably focus either around laharl or a xover
character. Will probably include elements of devil may cry. But
before I start on THAT particular piece of shit (because, like most
writers, I think my own pieces of work suck horribly and for the life
of me can't understand why you all enjoy it.) I had to get this
story out!</P><P>Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto,
nor do I ever wish to. Even the creators of Elfin Lied couldn't
pull this series from the shit-hole kishimoto has dug for it.</P><P>Normal – normal<BR><B>bold – Kyuubi</B><U><B><BR></B></U><I><U>italics
underlined – lyrics<BR></U></I><I>italics - thoughts</I><U><BR></U><p></P><P><B>WMWMW</B></P><P>"Are you sure you don't want me
to walk you home Naruto?" asked a reluctant Ino.</P><P>Naruto looked at her and forced a
small smile, "no I'm good ino-chan! What kind if ninja would I be
if I was afraid of the dark?" and with that, Naruto turned from the
party that would last well into the night and began his trek home.</P><P>Ino watched Naruto turn and leave
with a frown marring her features.</P><P>'<I>Ever since Sasuke abandoned
us, Naruto has been becoming more and more lonesome… what could
have happened?'</I></P><P>With no further things to act on,
the young yamanaka turned slowly and walked back inside. If Naruto
said he would be ok, then who was she to judge?</P><P><B>WMWMW</B></P><P><I><U></U></I></P><P><I><U>I am a man who walks alone.</U></I></P><P>Naruto sensed rather then heard Ino
turn and return inside, the door closing and light being blotted out
once more by inky black. He sighed and began his walk home, after
Sasuke he just couldn't let anyone get close to him again…<BR><I><U><BR>And
when I'm walking a dark road,<BR>At night or strolling through the
park.</U></I></P><P>Noticing a small park, the blonde
absently deviates from his path and heads towards it. Strolling
slowly down the shadowy paths, he finds himself stopping and gazing
out over the lake in front of him.<I><U><p>When the light begins
to change,<BR>I sometimes feel a little strange,<p></U></I>in
his peripheral view, the chakra lamps began to flicker brighter then
dimmer, bathing the park around him in a dull twilight..<BR><I><U><BR>A
little anxious when its dark…<p></U></I>with a final flash,
the lamps flicker out of existence, the park becoming consumed in
pitch black. gazing around him in the night, Naruto suddenly comes
under the feeling that he's no longer alone…<I><U><p>Fear of
the dark, fear of the dark…<BR>I have a constant fear that
something's always near…<p></U></I>even as a child he feared
it, the dark. It consumed his world and plagued him nightmares…</P><P>Making up his mind, Naruto turned
and ran from the park. Leaping up upon the roofs, he made his way
swiftly towards his apartment, the feeling of discomfort and anxiety
growing.<I><U><p>Fear of the dark, fear of the dark…<BR>I have
a phobia that someone's always there…<p></U></I>he would
never admit it…no…but he always feared the dark, because he
always felt that someone was always there. Watching him, mocking him,
judging him….<I><U><p>Have you run your fingers down the
wall?<p></U></I>Jumping swiftly to his apartment window, Naruto
quickly discovers it to be locked and inaccessible.</P><P>"Huh? I never lock my window…."<BR>a
quick check reveals all the other windows on the floor to be locked
as well. Shrugging and the strange </P><P>event, Naruto swung down from his
perch unto the floor below him and opened a window. Quickly sliding
in, he closes the window once more and makes his way to the
door.<I><U><p>And have you felt your neck skin crawl,<BR>When
you're searching for the light?!<p></U></I>Stumbling over
furniture, Naruto began to search in vain for the light. He had no
idea where the door was and it was dark in here….so dark….he felt
it again, as his skin prickled and he barely suppressed a
shiver….<I><U><p>Sometimes when you're scared to take a
look<BR>at the corner of the room<p></U></I>suddenly finding the
door handle, Naruto began to sigh and turn it to open the door but he
stopped abruptly as he felt it once more….watching…mocking….something
was here!</P><P>Quickly turning his head to the side
to observe the room, he sees nothing upon first glance, but as he
sighs his relief and turns back to open the door and leave he sees
them in the corner…<I><U><p>You've sensed that something's
watching you!<p></U></I>Residing in the shadowy corner, pair of
amused slitted crimson eyes practically glow in the darkness. Those
oh so familiar eyes….<I><U><p>Have you ever been alone at
night?<p></U></I>Yanking the door open, Naruto tore out of the
blackened room. Running down the hall towards the stairs, he just had
to make it his room! If he could make then he would be fine!<I><U><p>Thought
you heard footsteps behind,<BR>And turned around and no one's
there?<p></U></I>His trained ears picked up the sound of
footsteps other than his echoing down the hall. Each foot fall
resounding against the deafening silence like a colossal bell chiming
its existence to reality.</P><P>Spinning around in a fighting stance
he found nothing in the hallway besides himself. Eyes widening in
fear, Naruto turned once more and began to run with renewed
fervor…<I><U><p>And as you quicken up your pace,<BR>You find
it hard to look again!<p></U></I>As soon as he turned and began
to run again, the foot falls returned. Closer than before, they were
</P><P>almost upon him! Closer, closer, the
distance was draining. The fear increasing and the adrenaline
rushing, Naruto turned on point and dashed up the stairs. He was
almost safe!<BR><I><U><BR>Because you're sure there's someone
there.<p></U></I>Crimson eyes twinkled in delight as Naruto ran
up the stairs; glimpses of several furry tails could be seen through
the blinding darkness. Staring up the stairs that Naruto had just
ascended, the eyes seem to smile.<I><U><p>Watching horror films
the night before,<BR>Debating witches and folklore!!<p></U></I>His
door! It was insight, just a little closer! Racing towards the door,
Naruto ripped it open and slid inside. Quickly turning and locking
the door behind him and turning on the light, Naruto slipped into his
chair and gave a tired sigh.<I><U><p>The unknown troubles on
your mind<BR>Maybe your mind is playing tricks?<p></U></I>Another
night, another fear…would this never end? Shaking his head, Naruto
got up and headed towards his room. Shedding his clothing as he went,
our blonde finally collapsed onto the bed.</P><P>He rolled over and gazed tiredly at
the ceiling light…<BR>"Shizu-nee says there's nothing to worry
about…a ninja that's afraid of the dark…tch, some ninja I
am…"<I><U><p>You sense, and suddenly eyes fix<BR>On dancing
shadows from behind…<p></U></I>the ceiling light flickered
minutely, in the corner of his mind Naruto felt that presence again…</P><P>The shadows flickered in his room as
he sat up and looked around the lighted room, absolutely nothing was
there. Preparing to simply fall back against his bed and sleep the
darkness away, Naruto caught the sight of a strange moving shadow
upon the wall in front of him.</P><P>"Behind me!?"<I><U><p>Fear
of the dark, fear of the dark….<BR>I have a constant fear that
someone's always near…<p></U></I>whirling around to face the
intruder, the light flashes brightly and blinds Naruto for mere
moments. When he opens his eyes once more his room is bathed in
darkness, the intruder nowhere to be seen….but it was still
there…<I><U><p></U></I></P><P><I><U>Fear of the dark, fear of the
dark…<BR>I have a phobia that someone's always there…<p></U></I>scooting
back onto the middle of his bed, Naruto stares desperately into the
inky darkness.</P><P>A soft object brushes against his
arm, and another around his leg, Naruto tensed up in preparation of
whatever was with him.</P><P>Shortly after, a pair of slender
arms wrapped around his torso from behind, warm soft breathes flowing
past his ear and cords…no…tails wrapped around him like a
blanket.<I><U><p>When I'm walking a dark road<p></U></I>a
peaceful feeling invaded Naruto, almost against his will he began to
relax back into the person who had embraced him so gently.<p>For
moments the silence is content, darkness no longer so foreboding,
Naruto asks the only thing that comes to mind.</P><P>"Who are you….."</P><P>Silence once more, the tranquil
breathing against his ears never changing, slowly a breath is taken
and a whisper is given, the velvety quality of the voice bringing a
small serene smile to the blonde's face.<p><B>"I'm hurt
kit, you don't recognize me?"</B><I><U><p></U></I>Naruto's
eyes snapped open, it was then it dawned upon him…</P><P>A light giggle escapes the girl
embracing him as she nuzzles into his neck.<BR><I><U><BR>I am a man
who walks alone…<p></U></I><B>"You were never alone kit, I'm
always here…"</B></P><P>XXxXxxXxxxXENDXxxxXxxXxXX</P><P>Well…originally this was supposed
to horror\angst but…well it kind of ended up as a suspense\romance.</P><P>Well, what can you do? Read and
review all, tell me what you think.</P><P>Terra Youkai, the bloody angel.</P>
