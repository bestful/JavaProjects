After all this time it is actually quite comforting, all he had to do is nap, talk and sometimes feed the girl charka when she was in some life treating situation and that was about it. To tell the truth Kyuubi was hating the idea of leaving his comfortable cage and having to hunt, kill, and do everything a demon dose to stay alive.</p><p>In short Kyuubi had become a lazy demon. Of course he had become a contempt, lazy demon.</p><p>But there were some days that all Kyuubi could smell is ramen and some days all Kyuubi could see is orange and some days he could only smell orange and see ramen and hear 'Dattaboy' that he could just break open these bars that kept them apart and force something healthy down her thought.</p><p>And he was so close once but that just had to be the day he found out the bars can rebuild themselves. Quickly.</p><p>So he is forced to listen to 'Dattaboy' and take in the scent of ramen and see orange even though she fuckin' twenty years old and should have out grown that by now, if not for herself for his sanity.</p><p>He would have been perfectly fine with purple.</p><p>"Kyuu-kun are you done?" Chimed in Naruto's voice.</p><p>Kyuubi turned his head to the blond he had come to know very well over the years. Her blond hair was tied up into a bun. She had grown taller over the years thanks to the fact that Kakashi had fed her something other than ramen but her grin has never faded and her eyes only shown much more wisdom than they had years ago. "Annoying." was the only statement he could come up with.</p><p>She smiled at him. Naruto made her way over to the jail that he was contained in. "You've grown." He stated.</p><p>She smiled at him and entered the jail. "But your still an idiot." a low chuckled rumbled in his thought.</p><p>Naruto's hand reached up and gently stroked his muzzle. He turned back into his human from like all the other times. Arms wrapped around his waist and he nuzzled into the crook of her neck.</p><p>Kyuubi doesn't really care about being sealed inside of Naruto because when all he can hear is her soft voice and all he can feel is her warmth, things seem to be looking up to him.</p></p>
