He had just woken up for his newest mission.</p><p>"Kakashi- sensei said to meet him at the Hokage tower, I wonder what mission baa- chan has for Team seven today." He said in a small voice. Now Naruto was far from the happy-go-lucky kid people thought, he was in fact a true hardened Shinobi. He has hidden his abilities from the eyes of civilians and his friends. He was originally the apprentice of Itachi Uchiha before his defection which Naruto knew to be fake, he was also the strongest member of Danzo's ROOT force. Naruto decided that today would be different, he would no longer hide behind his mask of happiness, he would no longer hide his skills from the eyes of fellow Shinobi and Konoha civilians. He would show everybody the TRUE Naruto Uzumaki. Instead of his usual Orange jumpsuit he donned a black shirt with black pants and a specially made black cloak which would make him turn invisible when he added chakra to it, it would also increase in weight when he added a special seal to it. He also wore a pair of black boots and a black armband which he wrapped around his head in memory of one of his ROOT comrades. He looked in the mirror and sighed as he removed the Genjutsu he had cast upon himself revealing the scars that he gained from missions and beatings by the villagers. He felt a short pulling at the back of his mind and smiled.</p><p>"Hi Kyuubi." He said.</p><p>"<b>Good morning Kit, sleep well?" </b>The nine tailed demon asked with a yawn.</p><p>"Yeah I slept alright, just going to meet Kakashi- sensei at the Hokage tower to get my mission."</p><p><b>"Alright then Kit, I won't keep you for too long, I just wanna talk till you get to the tower."</b></p><p>"Sure thing, what you want to talk about?" Naruto asked as he locked his door and walked up the street, welcomed by many glares from the civilians.</p><p><b>"Why do you not retaliate when they glare at you? When they beat you? When they insult you? They treat you worse than any demon's torture and you just blow it off like it's nothing." </b>Kyuubi asked with sadness in her eyes (Yes, Kyuubi is a female so fuck you you sexist twats :P)</p><p>"Because if I did to them what they did to me I would be no better than them. If I just blow it off and earn their appreciation then I can hold my head high and be proud that I haven't sunk to their level. People will always have a small level of hatred for you Kyuubi- chan, that will never change but you must know that I love you and that will never change."</p><p>Kyuubi smiled and said "<b>I love you too Naruto-kun, I just hope that you have the chance to let me out soon."</b></p><p>Naruto nodded and entered the Hokage tower and was greeted with a warm smile from the receptionist.</p><p>"Hey Naruto, you meeting your sensei upstairs right?" She asked to Naruto who gave a nod.</p><p>"Well go on up then." She smiled to Naruto as he walked up the steps and entered Tsunade's office. He looked around and saw Kakashi stood there with a big smile on his face which was visible due to him having no mask on this time, along with Iruka and Mizuki. (Mizuki isn't a bad guy in this fic)</p><p>"Iruka- sensei? Mizuki- sensei? What are you two doing here?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"Well Naruto, you know how Jiraiya said you have that three year training trip with him?" Iruka said. Naruto nodded.</p><p>"We three," He motioned to himself, Mizuki and Kakashi. "Asked him if we could train you along with him due to the Akatsuki preparing to attack to get you and he agreed to it."</p><p>"I did Naruto, I also managed to find you somebody who can train you in the art of Kenjutsu and another ability for people with your condition." Jiraiya said from the window.</p><p><b>"</b>Ero- sennin." Naruto acknowledged the perverted hermit and turned back to Iruka and Mizuki.</p><p>"SO what will you two be training me in?"</p><p><b>"</b>I will train you in stealth." Iruka said.</p><p>"I will train you to increase the level's of endurance and chakra you possess." Mizuki said.</p><p><b>"</b>I will be teaching you many of the Ninjutsu I know Naruto." Kakashi said.</p><p><b>"</b>And I will be teaching you the arts of the Toad Sage." Jiraiya said.</p><p>Naruto looked pleasantly suprised but his thoughts were interrupted when another voice cut in and made Naruto turn. He was now looking at a man with white hair that hung over his eyes, he wore a blood red jacket that hung slightly above his ankles<b>, </b>a set of baggy black leather pants with black boots, he also had a large sword on his back which was strapped there by a brown strap connected around his chest, two holsters were around his waist which held two handguns with the inscriptions "Ebony" and "Ivory" on them.</p><p>"You Naruto Uzumaki?" the man asked.</p><p>"Yeah, who are you?" Naruto replied with a distrusting tone. The man gave a small chuckle and sai "My name is Dante, i'm the one who's going to train you with the old perv-" Jiraiya glared. "-the cyclops-" Kakashi glared too. "and the two closet pervs." Iruka and Mizuki glared as well. Dante brushed off the glares and looked Naruto in the eye.</p><p>"First things first though, you need to release the nine tailed vixen sealed within you."</p><p>Naruto froze.</p><p>"How did you-" Dante cut Naruto off.</p><p>"I met her once, nearly killed the poor woman, damn she was beautiful though." Dante chuckled before looking back at Naruto.</p><p>"That can be done when we are out of Konoha though Naruto, for now we need you to get ready and say your goodbyes because we are leaving in three hours."</p><p>Naruto nodded and walked out of the Hokage tower.</p><p>"<b>Naruto- kun, will you finally tell Hinata about me and about you needing at least five wives because of the CRA?" </b>Kyuubi asked the blonde teen.</p><p>"Yeah Kyuubi- chan, i'll tell her now. For now you just sleep okay?" Naruto replied and cut off his mental link to the vixen and approached the training grounds for Hinata's team.</p><p>"Well done Hinata, you are improving at a brilliant pace." Shino complimented Hinata who started blushing up a storm from the compliment.</p><p>"Th-Thank you Shino- kun."</p><p>Naruto couldn't help but smile at Hinata's blush before calling out "Hinata!"</p><p>Hinata froze when she heard Naruto's voice. Naruto approached her and said "I have something important to tell you Hinata. Can you come with me for a moment?"</p><p>Hinata could only nod and follow him.</p><p>"I will bring her back in a moment Kurenai- chan, she will only be ten minutes at least."</p><p>Kurenai looked suprised at the chan suffix but nodded nonetheless and went back to training Shino.</p><p>"What do you need to tell me Naruto-kun?" Hinata said, suprisingly without a stutter.</p><p><b>"</b>I know how you feel about me Hinata and I want you to know I feel the same way but there is two problems with it. One that you will probably not like and one that i'm scared to tell you.<b>" </b>Naruto said with a sad tone.<b><br></b></p><p>"What are they Naruto- kun?" Hinata asked.<p>Naruto looked her sadly in the eyes and said "You would have to share me with four other women because I have to use the CRA to revive my clans. And... the last reason is... I am the Jinchuriki of the Kyuubi no kitsune."</p>
