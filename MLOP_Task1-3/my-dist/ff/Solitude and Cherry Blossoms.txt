My name's
Laila and this is my first story in a long time and I hope you enjoy
it! This has been written for about a year now, and I just found it
in a pile in my bedroom so I thought it might be worthy of being
online. Anyway, this is in the category of Naruto, and just so you
know the first bit of it is a little slow. But only the first few
paragraphs, so please, don't blow off reading it. It gets good
after a little bit, at least in my opinion, and I hope that you will
think so too. I really enjoy writing and will do anything to get
better. I hope you think it's good, and as always reviews are
welcome. I need all the help I can get!</B></p><P><B>Disclaimer:
I do not own Naruto now any of its characters. Only the ones I
create.</B></p><P><B>Please
enjoy! Please review too </B></p><P><B>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</B></p><P>Seclusion can
be a dangerous thing, something that most would try to avoid at all
cost. Being alone, no one to hold or embrace, not a soul to depend on
but your own. Though these traits are of the most disagreeable
nature, seclusion can also be the greatest <I>company, </I>so to
speak, that you could imagine. Obtaining bravery beyond measure,
total independence, and no emotional connection to anyone to distract
you of any sort of task or predicament are gained through loneliness.
These can be some of the most valuable things for any human being to
gain, yet at what cost. For years I have favored seclusion. The mere
thought of having only myself to depend on filled my stomach to the
brim with, oh what's the word…happiness…? Yes, that's it. The
joy of having no one near me to bring annoyance or disturbance into
my life 'tickled me pink'. Although I have not always had the
enjoyment of isolation, it came soon enough, bringing with it the
valuable traits, those of which would not make me the person I am
today if I had not received them.</p><P>Considering
my most <I>amiable </I>nature, I would have rather been stabbed in
the chest than be stuck in the middle of the predicament at hand.
Being in any contact with humans disgusted me, and yet, this was
something to do, entertaining even, if that's what you could call
fear. But even then, this was bound to happen some way or another, so
might as well face it now than later on when your mind has been
wrapped around the expected experience, one that you have no desire
to come into contact with. As of now, I must admit, I am not prepared
for this situation. However that has never stopped me before, so why
should it now.</p><P>Fright has
never been a large problem for me. It's not as if I hold no fear.
It only took grasp of me on rare occasions, and when it did it held
strongly, releasing its grip on me for no reason. For causes I knew
not, fear seemed to avoid me most of the time, only approaching me in
a life or death situation, that of which were the circumstances
taking place this very second. In the manner I had since long ago
expected, fear had taken hold of me once again.</p><P>Sitting upon
the back of my horse we ran through the forest, my heart pounding
with excitement, which it rarely did. My glance had not stayed still
since the moment we had departed from safety and nor did it now. Damn
I hated the fact that my eyes always betrayed me, always examining
everything around me against my will. The old saying 'you are your
own man' was a load of pointless shit in my consideration. If we
were our own, then why did our bodies do things that we had no
opinion in, therefore not even phasing the execution of the act? No,
our bodies are people in themselves, and we are but the things to
fill them.</p><P>My eyes
continued to wander left and right, searching the premises of any
threatening person. Trees blurred past me as my horse galloped
through the branches encircled around us. Hooves pounded the ground
beneath me, the full extent of their power digging into the earth
with ease, my horse's legs pivoting off the ground to push himself
forward with more force.</p><P>My breaths
had become harsh and raspy, as had my horse's. I had, of course,
physically and mentally prepared myself for hardships in life through
my earlier years, one of which was facing me. Though my body is
extremely fit and has a large amount of stamina, it still does not
fit the requirements of my standards. But that can always be changed.
But for now I must deal with what I've got, even if it isn't
sufficient enough. And to state it simply, my mind has never been
stronger, always a concrete wall to any obstacle coming its way.</p><P>My head,
unwillingly again, turned to glance behind. Once again my eyes
disappointed me, revealing the thing I was trying to shun away at all
cost. About five hundred feet behind me were five men mounted upon
thoroughbred horses pursuing me at an even rate of speed. Each of
their gazes set firmly upon me, they increased their velocity in an
instant, closing some distance between us. Trying to release some of
the fear inside of me, I smirked as I did the same, putting more
distance than before between us.</p><P>This was a
disturbance to me, and I wanted more than anything to rid of it.
Having hidden myself from the world for so long, even just seeing
others brought contempt into my mind. I wanted this to end as quickly
as possible so that I could escape the view of people.</p><P>A cold chill
ran down my spine, in return waking me from my thoughts. I smiled at
this new factor.</p><P><I>Trying
to get the upper hand, eh?</I></p><P>As I expected
a slightly audible twang was heard in the direction behind me,
followed by the view of a thin arrow flying past, missing its target
by a small amount. This shot a great amount of adrenalin through my
veins.</p><P>"Arrows
won't work you dicks!" I yelled at the top of my lungs. That
was sure to tick them off. And of course it did.</p><P>In a span of
three seconds, seventeen arrows were fired at me, one of which struck
my right shoulder. Though it did hit its target, it didn't faze me
whatsoever. One of the benefits of my 'childhood' was stamina
through pain. Reaching over with my left hand I grasped the wooden
stick and pulled it out with ease, throwing it to the ground
afterwards.</p><P>They had to
be joking if this was all the power they had. Good Lord, I could have
beaten them in my sleep! Well, I should know better than to assume
that. I learned never to act as though you understood the whole
situation in and out. And the one time that I did, I paid for it
greatly.</p><P>Gripping the
reins tighter, I prepared myself for the obstacle up ahead. One
hundred feet away was a large concrete wall, a small cottage to one
side of it. If I could get over this with more speed than the men
behind me, it could put some space between us.</p><P>The jump came
and went in a matter of seconds, my horse flying over the concrete
gracefully without even a hint of coming into contact with the wall.</p><P>I was growing
tired of this game of tag, so I set my mind to work on devising an
escape. Where would be the perfect place to run, without being
followed? I could've ran into the small cottage we had just passed
while the men were still behind the concrete wall, but that chance
was far gone, plus it would have been an obvious place to search. I
had to think of something new with the materials I had before me,
which admittedly was not much.</p><P>All around me
were trees and brush, all except a small four-way crossroad coming up
ahead. From what I could tell, not a soul was near it. Just the way I
like it. If only it were that way at this moment, where no one was
near and I had only myself. But sadly enough it wasn't. Sometimes
life could be such a disappointment.</p><P>Above the
center of the crossroad hung the branch of an oak tree. It loomed
over the dirt road, about fifteen feet above the ground. This could
possibly work. If I could time it just right, it might be successful.
And if I could get cries of pain from my followers, then my heart
would be filled with pure ecstasy.</p><P>For most the
task of flipping one's self onto a high branch while on the back of
a galloping horse would be a great challenge, one that would strike
uneasiness into their hearts. But for me, this was easy. Twelve years
of physical training wasn't done for nothing, now was it?</p><P>The shear
thrill of escaping my captors once again was beginning to enter my
body, though I knew not to become overconfident was what truly should
have been in my mind. This was supposed to be a challenge? They
couldn't possibly think that this was threatening in any manner,
and by the looks of it that was what they suspected me to believe.
What insolent people. If they thought that this would stop me,
forcing me to hand myself over to them, they were sorely mistaken.</p><P>Now not only
was I about to throw myself upon a thick branch fifteen feet in the
air, but I was also going to position myself atop that limb and
attack them from above. To be truthfully honest, this was not one of
my best creations in mind and yet it worked for the situation at
hand.</p><P><I>Here
goes. </I></p><P>The distance
between the escape and I lessened with each second, and eventually I
was twenty feet from it. Timing was the key to this dodging of these
unlikable <I>things</I>. If I thrust myself upon the branch too early
or too late it could cause a problem such as losing my grip on the
limb and falling or not getting a firm enough grip on the branch.</p><P>My horse took
one last stride before my departure and we were right below the
branch in question. I reached up, grasped the wood and flung myself
onto the branch, flipping my body around the limb and landing myself
atop it, balancing myself fairly well and keeping my eyes pointed
toward the area where the soon to be victims would arrive in a short
time.</p><P>The men
finally caught up. Their horses had been halted and their gazes had
come to look above, toward the area where I was positioned. But their
searching was, of course, futile. All they had seen was a
disappearing adolescent, and though they knew the region into which I
had gone, they knew not the pinpoint spot of which I was hiding.
Leaves covered my existence, though not fully. True, they did not
cover me entirely, yet they did hide me from view unless, that is,
you have the eyes of a hawk in your skull.</p><P>I reached
behind me and grabbed the bow and arrow tied around my back. I pulled
them into my grasp and held an arrow to the bow. Raising the
contraption to a position before me, I held steady my arm in an
attempt to get a perfect aim on my first target, the man in the front
center.</p><P>Soon my mind
would be rejoicing fully, after hearing cries of anguish from my
target, naturally. And for once in my life, what I had desired was
given to me without hesitation. Cries emanated from the mouth of my
prey as he fell to the ground, his hands lightly wrapped around the
arrow that now pierced through his chest. The men around him jumped
from the horses' backs and crowded around him in an attempt to give
him some sort of assistance.</p><P>Inside I was
shining with triumph, even though it was a small amount of it. This
small accomplishment showed that the men had no clue where I was
hiding, which theoretically can be the best advantage when attacking
in an unbeknownst position to the victim.</p><P>As I drew a
second arrow to my bow, an unfamiliar presence crept into my heart. I
paused and held my body still, for precaution. I had a few hunches as
to what this 'feeling' could be. One, a human minding their own
business though drawing near a place they should never have entered;
two, some animal wandering in the forest; or three, another enemy.</p><P>I turned my
head to look behind, the exact direction from whence came the
presence I had felt. My eyes immediately went to work searching for
the new addition to our happy little congregation. They quickly
caught sight of a small form and discovered that it was but a fox, a
familiar one at that. Its eyes met my own in an instance and with the
look it gave me I knew what to expect. An interruption was on its way
though it might not truly be an interruption. Hell, it could just
mind its own business and leave on its merry way, which was most
likely what it was going to do.</p><P>I quickly
nodded my head in thanks and shot my vision forward to return myself
to the present event. The men had not progressed much since the time
my attention had left them, and they still searched the trees. Man
can truly be dysfunctional at times.</p><P>I returned to
my bow and arrow and aimed for the next fool. Firing another shot,
the next victim fell to the ground motionless. I felt another rush of
adrenaline flow through my veins. You could never defeat the feeling
of bringing down an enemy without flaws. It was a feeling of pure
ecstasy that not a thing could diminish.</p><P>The unharmed
men pulled the two wounded upon their own horses and galloped away.
Apparently they had come unprepared, for they left in quite a hurry,
if I must say so myself.</p><P>My job had
been completed. I had once again escaped the clutches of those heart
dirty bastards, and would now return to my daily solitude. But before
doing so I would wait, just to see if they truly had left. I would
wait for at least twenty minutes, just to be sure that it was safe to
leave.</p><P>After
waiting, which was truthfully the hardest part of the entire ordeal,
I leaped from the branch and onto the ground, balancing myself
perfectly and landing softly upon my feet as if I were a feline.
Bringing my fingers to my lips I whistled, a notice for my horse to
return. Within seconds he ran up to me and stood at my side, waiting
expectantly for me to mount his back.</p><P>With hopeful
thoughts of peace and quiet running through my head, I galloped
toward my residence, if you could call it that. I have been on the
move for as long as I can remember, and have never stayed at one spot
for more than a month. But of course, no doubt people knew about me.
Damn, word traveled fast these days, considering I would leave one
area, and go five hundred miles away and the next town would know who
I was as well as the last did! Well, it wasn't as though they
didn't have a right to know…</p><P>Ah, how I
loved the fact that my horse would tire after a large amount of
sprinting, just as he did now. It gave me a chance to run, something
I loved to do considering I was probably the fastest runner anyone
could find no matter where they searched.</p><P>I
hopped off of his back and pat his neck, a sign of a job well done.
He trotted off toward a river nearby to drink and take a rest,
knowing fully well that I would call for him when I had reached our
hideout. It was a regularly done act, and he had grown accustomed to
listening intently for my whistle during his rest.</p><P>I
took my running position, one I had used many times, and took a deep
breath. I loved running, so this was an extra bonus to beating my
pursuers. When I was young I had become amazingly good at running,
for reasons I'd rather not say.</p><P>My
house, so to speak, was about five miles from my current location. It
would only take me about three minutes to get there, and that was at
a slow pace. If you were to watch me run, which I'd prefer you
didn't, you wouldn't be able to see me. The only thing visible to
your eyes would be a blur, disappearing the second it became
detectable. Rarely was I noticed when running, for I ran so fast that
only the sharpest of eyes could pick up my form.</p><P>I
kicked off from the ground and was gone. Instead of running on the
ground like normal people, I would thrust forward and then push off
from the trunk of some random tree, and continue doing this until I
had reached my destination. It took barely any effort, and was the
most sufficient way of traveling without being tracked.</p><P>In
no time at all, literally, I was at the place where I took residence,
which strangely was a large cave on the side of a steep cliff. The
rocks poured over the opening of the cave, covering the existence of
the rocky shelter from travelers' eyes on the road below.</p><P>I
entered the cave, knowing that I was not alone.</p><P>"Shit."</p><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P><B>So, that's the end of
Chapter 1. The ending wasn't much of a foreshadow, but hell, it
will all work out. If you have any comments, please give me a review.
If you have any suggestions or anything for the next chapter I am
completely welcoming them. Well, I hope you liked it. I will update
as soon as possible. Reviews, reviews, reviews! I will love you if
you give them to me, because I really want feedback. I want to know
if I can actually write well or not!</B></p><P><B>Please Review!</B></p><P><B>Till next time,</B></p><P><B>Laila</B></p>
