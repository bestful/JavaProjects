<p>Chapter 1:
the fox, the ninja and the damn bloody mob of angry villagers.</p><p>In a dark
and hidden room you could see two creatures talking to each other.</p><p>"Have
you understood the mission?" a male asked the little one</p><p>"Yes
rokubi sir" answered the little creature</p><p>"Good go
then young kit and bring back the oni-kage or we are all doomed,"
said the rokubi</p><p>(A/N this
is not the bijou rokubi its just a rank)</p><p>"Yes
sir" answered the young fox</p><p>He
slowly left the room thinking <b>"</b><b><u>hmm
I wonder where I shall start looking in that place it pretty huge and
those stone faces is scary</u></b><b>"</b></p><p><b>Five
days later in konoha</b></p><p>Kage bunshin no jutsu
shouted a young kid in an arena where people had come to watch the
fights. It was of course the chuunin exams so only a complete idiot
would miss it.</p><p>"That
trick will not work on me drop-out" said a boy with white eyes</p><p>"You
never know until you have tried it neji," the blond said</p><p>"Hmm you
may try to fight fate but you will never win naruto so you can just
give up here and now"</p><p>"Forget
it if you don't take this seriously, then I have to beat it into
you" said naruto</p><p>The clones
attacked while the real naruto thought of a plan</p><p>Some
feet away on top of the wall sat a little fox observing the match it
looked like the blond would lose "<u>this
kid got no chance in hell to win he is to weak</u>"</p><p>Suddenly a
small earthquake hit the town of konoha and knocked the small fox
down from the wall and into the head of the blond ninja everybody in
the arena noticed the fox but what surprised them the most was its
tail or should I say tales. Yes tales the fox had four crimson red
tales swishing behind it.</p><p>People
started to shout about killing the fox of course the killing intent
on the fox petrified it.</p><p>"Please
help me and I will make it up for you" the fox pleaded the blond
ninja</p><p>"What
the…. The fox can talk!?"</p><p>"Of
course I can talk all kitsunes whit four or more tales have the gift
of speech, so will you help me?"</p><p>"Eh of
course I will tell my clone to dig you a tunnel"</p><p>"Thanks"</p><p>Suddenly
the ground broke open and the fox ran down the tunnel.</p><p>Two days
later after the attack of sand and sound in a wooden area</p><p>The young
kitsune walked up to the young ninja and sat down</p><p>"Thanks
for helping me again"</p><p>"No
problem but why did you want to hide in my apartment"</p><p>"Well
let just say I'm glad that I got out of the streets god I hate
mobs"</p><p>"Let me
guess a villager found you looking for food and then started to chase
you?"</p><p>"Yea"
he sighted</p><p>"So you
said that you would make up for me helping you"</p><p>"Yea I
could help you get on good terms with the oni-kage"</p><p>"The
oni-kage who's that?"</p><p>"You
know him as kyuubi"</p><p>"Kyuubi!?
Why would I care about him he wrecked my life when he attacked
konoha"</p><p>"I know
that just let me into your mind and we will sort things out okay"</p><p>"I don't
know isn't there another way?"</p><p>"Well
there is one and its called the kitsune kage bunshin no jutsu and it
will give kyuubi a temporary human body other than that there isn't
any other way"</p><p>"Ok I
guess it would be easier to let you into my mind I don't want to
alert anbu with kyuubis presence"</p><p>"Good
just relax and I will take care of every thing"</p><p>The fox
walked up to naruto and sat in between his legs</p><p>"Ready?"</p><p>"As
ready as I will ever be lets see the fuzz ball"</p><p>As he said that one of the kitsunes tales touched his forehead and
every thing went dark….</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>A/N so

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>A/N</p><P>Well I have been busy with school so
I haven't have time to write this chapter until now so here you go.
I have thought and I will give him both an eye Kekkei Genkai and a
shape shifting so its up to you if you want him to be able to turn
into a bat or a wolf or all other animals. If you guys choose vampire
or lycanthrope then he will gain more power than if you choose shape
shifting but also weaknesses. And I STILL needs a beta reader and
could any give me a good Japanese translator that DOESN'T turn the
text into Japanese signs.</p><P>(Disclaimer: I don't own NARUTO I don't own the

of the kitsunes 


<P>Chapter 2: the fox, the
demon and the perverted frog</p><P>Suddenly both of them
landed in what looked like a big sewer with lots of tunnels it was
damp in there and it didn't smell to nice either the walls was
covered with what looked like runes and kanji. Naruto realised where
they were.</p><P>"Ok so we are here now
shall we look for him"?</p><P>"Is this your mind it
looks like a sewer what the hell have happened to you?"</p><P>"I don't know what
you're talking about fox it has always looked like this"</p><P>"Well the mindscape
usually reflect a persons soul or what they have been through in
their lives, but this place either is your soul rotten as hell or you
have been through extremely tough hardships"</p><P>"The latter is correct
the people in this town didn't treat me especially well"</p><P>"Well this means we
just got to check your memories I got to know what you been through
if we shall work together"</p><P>"What are you talking
about what work together?"</p><P>"You will understand
after we talked to kyuubi"</p><P>Three hours later.</p><P>"Finally where here
dammit, it didn't take this long last time but finally we are here"</p><P>They began to approach a
set of huge iron gates with a piece of paper holding it shut, behind
the gates where an eerier red glow that seemed to pulsate slowly like
it was sleeping.</p><P>"Hey fur-ball wake up
dammit"</p><P>"<B>Shut the hell up
gaki before I rip you to shreds what do you want"</B></p><P>"This fox wanted to
talk to you"</p><P>"hello
kyuubi-hime"</p><P>"<B>That voice could
it be you zaphira?"</B></p><P>"Wait a sec did you just call
kyuubi hime? Isn't that just for girls?"</p><P>"Of course it's only
for girls, why the hell did you think I called the queen of demons
hime!"</p><P>"Wait a second did you
just say queen of demons?"</p><P>"Yes it seems that
your hearing works"</p><P>"So kyuubi is a girl!"</p><P>"Of course"</p><P>"<B>Haven't you
forgot about something?"</B></p><P>"Sorry kyuubi-hime"</p><P>"<B>So what do you
want zaphira?"</B></p><P>"I was ordered to find you and
bring you back or the person that you are bound to so we get our kage
back"</p><P>"<B>But only a kitsune
can be a oni kage"</B></p><P>"…."</p><P>"<B>Oh I see damn
that's a big problem"</B></p><P>"Wait a sec what do you mean bring
me to become a kage I cant just leave they will hunt me down an kill
me!"</p><P>"And what do you mean
I must be a kitsune?"</p><P>"Well to become the
oni-kage you got to pass a few requirements to become one and one is
that you got to have nine tales"</p><P>"Do I look like a fox
to you?"</p><P>"No you don't but
that we can change listen to me naruto-kun you have nothing left in
this town except hatred they will never let your dream come true,
they fear what they can not control so I'm asking you nice do you
want to be loved by people and become a kage?"</p><P>"Of course"</p><P>"Then I'm sorry to
say that konoha is not gonna let ya they will keep tormenting you
until they can kill you and trust me they will and as soon as a new
hokage is selected then they will kill you because they cant control
you"</p><P>"We just got to wait
and see"</p><P>"At least let me give
you the power of the kitsunes to you now then you can choose what to
do because you cant become a oni-kage without becoming a nine-tails
so the faster you become a kitsune the faster you will be ready for
anything that this village throws at you okay?"</p><P>"<B>I agree to her she was my one of my students
before the accident now every one except her is dead"</B></p><P>"What accident?"</p><P>"<B>It's the reason
why I attacked konoha oh if I can get that son of a bitch that did it
to my kits, mate and my students then I will roast them in the flames
of hell for all eternity"</B></p><P>"What happened?"</p><P>"Her kits, mate and students where
killed by a man in konoha he summoned them and used them for
experiments his name was orochimaru"</p><P>"Wait a second you
mean that all that has happened to me was that hebi-teme fault?"</p><P>"Yea"</p><P>"Ok"</p><P>"Ok?"</p><P>"Give me the power so
I can get revenge for my new sensei"</p><P>"<B>Thanks kit"</B></p><P>"When did you stop calling me
gaki?"</p><P>"<B>When did you start calling me sensei?"</B></p><P>"Oh I see ok so how do I do this?"</p><P>"Easy just rip of ¾
of the seal off and then get to a secluded area within three days
then the transformation begins"</p><P>"Lets do this"</p><P>"<B>But wont it kill him?"</B></p><P>"Don't worry it wont
he will take over your body then he can make you a new one that you
have to train up but he wont get all your chakra just ¾ of it"</p><P>"Less talks more
action"</p><P>He walked up to the seal
and ripped of ¾ of the seal suddenly he was forced out of his
mind and into his body</p><P>Suddenly he sees a big
man with long spiky white hair</p><P>"What do you want
ero-senin?"</p><P>"What have I told you
about calling me that! Listen gaki we got a mission we are going to
retrieve a person"</p><P>"Ok but how long will
it take?"</p><P>"I don't know about
2-3 weeks"</p><P>"Hmm ok where are we
in three days?"</p><P>"In a forest area why
do you ask?"</p><P>"Nothing in
particular"</p><P>"Ok let's go"</p><P>§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§</p><P>A/N so this was the second chapter and I still need a

he heard that he already had 500 kg total on him and dident want to
have an additional 400 on.</p><p>"n...n...o..o
jiraya-sama i dident"</p><p>"then
stop complaining"</p><p>naruto left the clearing
with zaphira.</p><p>20 minuts later</p><p>the sun was shining down
on naruto thrue the leaves of the tree.</p><p>"is
this clearing good enough zaphira"</p><p>"yes
it is now we need to make some chakra barriers to stop every ninja in
the nearest 4 countrys to feel this"</p><p>"ok
how do i do it?"</p><p>"easy
do thees hand seals: monky dragon monky dragon horse snake dog"</p><p>suddenly the clearing
shune golden before a dome of yellowish chakra sunk sown over them</p><p>"ok
now what"</p><p>"now
its just to wait but before that lets talk to kyuubi-hime"</p><p>In narutos mindscape</p><p>"<b>hello
kit what do you want?"</b></p><p>"im
just here to check if you wanted anything before the transformation"</p><p>"<b>well
there is one thing i need to know you see i can give you a bloodline
called cerebus eye that gives the owner three ability's but i will
change it to give you tree bloodlines instead of only three abilitys
plus i will give you a shapeshifter ability so i need to know what
bloodlines you want"</b></p><p>"well
yesterday you told me about the creation of the sharingan and
byakugan plus some other eye limits, so i have chosen Sharkagan,
Ingan and oblivion eye"</p><p>kyuubis
eyes widdened on the last one</p><p>"<b>you
know that the oblivion element is the most unstable, corruptive and
dangerus element out there even chaos is not that unstable"</b></p><p>"im
well aware of that but i think that with enough training at least i
can use the lower level jutsus"</p><p>"<b>ok
but only on one condition and that is you train my way until we
return to konoha"</b></p><p>suddenly
zaphira paled</p><p>"ky-ky-kyuubi
hime you must be kidding me are you going to use "<b>that"</b>
on him!"</p><p>"<b>yea
so get out of here its starting now"</b></p><p>outside</p><p>as
soon as naruto got out he feelt as his skin was on fire and his head
was about to expload, it was like you got strong acid on your skin
and it would not go away then his muscles started to act up ripping
and tearing to just get healed together again his bones shattered and
grow back on in matters of seconds, his ass liturary was blown of as
5 tail started to grow out his chest was pierced by 2 new ribs that
slunk bak ino the chest his throut felt like someone had poured
molten lava throu it as it adapted to extremely high temperatures his
eyes, ears and nose was too blown of as new stronger appeared his
fingers bleed as ig some one had stuck giant butcher knife thrue them
as claws appeared his teeth looked as if they was painted crimson
because of all the blood the new fangs produced it was a horrific to
say the least. There was blood every where it looked like a good day
in a butcher shop.</p><p>Three
hours later</p><p>naruto
woke up because of something buzzing near his ear but when he looked
it was just an insect wondering how the hell he could hear it he
looked around and saw the result of the transformation he felt like
he could not keep the breakfast as he left the grizzling sceen but no
before he burned it to the ground.</p><p>1
hour later at the camp</p><p>he
had gotten 3 big birds for dinner when suddenly he heard kyuubi talk</p><p>"<b>so
i see you had at least the sense to put a genjutsu over yourself"</b></p><p><u>"</u><u>of
course im not that stupid but i should at least tell jiraya."</u></p><p>"<b>i
agree so time to start your training i want you to take on 150 kg on
each limb and start tree climbing"</b></p><p>"you
got to be kidding me 150 kg!"</p><p>"<b>of
course you need as much chakra control as you can to use the oblivion

story a whole lot. And i also need to know what elemental affinity he
shall have.</p><p>Poll 1:</p><p>berserk kitsune(a kitsune that loves battle and
slaughter his enemy, has a sadists personality, best at offensive
skills often just uses raw power, kyuubi is a berserk kitsune)</p><p>guardian kitsune(a kitsune that protects people,
extreamly rare in the demon sociaty, usually kind and caring and will
give anybody no matter help if needed, best at defensive skills and
relays on jutsus more than tai)</p><p>void kitsune(a extremely dark kitsune that uses its
power to torture other beings, usually very scary and dark sense of
whats "fun" a being born thrue hate and rage towards some thing,
best at dark jutsus(a whole lot of curses and offensive skills) and
is hurt by light jutsus)</p><p>celestrial kitsune(a being made by the light element, a
messenger of inari and a guardian of the world, usually a divine aura
around it and is often mistaken for a angel instead of a demon, its
kind to those that deserve it but angry at those that oppose it or
inari, best at light(most supportive) and plane skills(plane skills
is a ability that lets you travel between worlds) is severly weakened
by dark jutsus)</p><p>elemental kitsune(a being made by the elements itself
can manipulate all the elements with less difficulty as the other may
use the element in its raw form with out chakra nothing much to add)</p><p>poll 2: chose two base elements 1 combined element and 1

because of kyuubi?"</p><P>"yea more or less ...
well maybe only three of them"</p><P>"can you explain them
for me?"</p><P>"sure"</p><P>"the
first bloodline is
called sharkagan its a combination of sharingan and byakagan with the
same ability's, it got 4 levels."</p><P>"first
is the so called muscle eye it lets me predict movements of my
enemy's with only watching the muscles contract and gives me all of
byakagans ability's"</p><P>"next
is speed eye it makes my body reacting faster and i can copy
taijutsus"</p><P>"third
is called memory eye because i can memory chakra patterns and copy
jutsus but if i give the hand seals my full attention i will be able
to learn the jutsu instantly so i can train with it without using the
eye"</p><P>"the
last level is called mangekyo sharkagan but unlike
mangekyo sharingan i dont have to kill my best friend for it and i
wont go blind"</p><P>"heh
the counsel will get a big shock when they hear about it ne gaki"</p><P>"yea
well next one is called ingan like the sharkagan it has 4 levels and
gives me the ability to examine seals and create seals"</p><P>"first
level gives me info of seals i already know of and low level seals"</p><P>"second
level gives me the ability to decipher medium level seals"</p><P>"third
level gives me the ability to decipher high level seals"</p><P>"the
fourth level gives me the ability to decipher demon seals and gives
me the ability to creat seals in my head instantly"</p><P>"to
get the last level i need to create a demon seal"</p><P>"what
is a demon seal exactly?"</p><P>"its
the worlds first seals that was introduced to it by demon extremely
powerful"</p><P>"so
literary its a seal masters greatest tool god i whish i had it"</p><P>"the
third is called oblivion eye its this one that is dangerus"</p><P>"really
how?"</p><P>"im
gonna explain so hold your horses"</p><P>"it
also got three levels but they activates aoutomatic after a given
time or how much chakra i use"</p><P>"well
that is great isn't it?"</p><P>"ero-sennin
shut up and let me explain"</p><P>"..."</p><P>"good
well normally it is but you see it uses a chakra called oblivion
chakra and that chakra is a sentient being and very corruptive the
more you use it the more corrupted you become"</p><P>"there
is 4 levels here too"</p><P>"first
is oblivion presence and it has a low corruption level"</p><P>"next
is oblivion influence it has a medium corruption level"</p><P>"third
is oblivion corruption as its name indicate its corrupting my body
until i push it out or get to the next level"</p><P>"the
last one is called oblivion mastery and gives me full control over
the chakra without risk for corruption and its permanent"</p><P>"that
is one dangerous bloodline but how does the chakra work?"</p><P>"its
too potent to be molded iton jutsus so only pure chakra attacks can
be used"</p><P>"and
what is the last one?"</p><P>"the
last one is my fathers bloodline animalism transformation"</p><P>"it
gives me the ability to change shape into different animals and with
time lets me mix animal parts"</p><P>"so
you know who was your old man?"</p><P>"yea
the yondaim"</p><P>"hey

until i can protect me it wasn't his fault that i became a
self-fulfilling prophecy"</p><P>"what

a good idea to explain the bloodlines. OK so i need you guys to vote
what type of kitsune he shall be and i can say it will change the
story a whole lot. And i also need to know what elemental affinity he
shall have. I have cut down the elements so it becomes easy to choose
so come on and vote again</p><P>Poll 1:</p><P>berserk kitsune(a kitsune that loves battle and

Jiraya I choose this by myself and second, kyuubi is no more."</p><p>"What
do you mean no more?"</p><p>"I
mean that there isn't any nine tailed beast in this world, just two 5 tailed."</p><p>"So...
what exactly did it do to you?"</p><p>"Lets

hearing, feeling, taste, became stronger, got my own yokai supply and I can
live up to 5000 millennia."</p><p>"Oh,
I am also Kyuubi's heir."</p><p>"Kyuubi's
heir?!"</p><p>"Yea, but
it's just a title, nothing more... ok, I may have some more bonuses other than
that."</p><p>"Like

don't know, a couple billion ryu, a mansion... oh right an army also."</p><p>"A
army?!"</p><p>"Yea

know the people in Konoha will not treat you better if they find out."</p><p>"Yes I
am aware of it."</p><p>The
next day</p><p>"Well

end of the day the trio reached there destination when they hade walked a bit
in the town until they heard a deep rumbling sound coming from the a building
before the wall gets blown out as a man fly's thru</p><p>"Seems
like we have found her."</p><p>"Seems
like it."</p><p>When
they entered the building there target sat at the end next to the big hole in
the wall</p><p>"So

you let someone like jiraya be Hokage especially with that orb."</p><p>"Damn
what have I done, I could have used that orb for research."</p><p>"Hmm
maybe it would not be that bad if it keeps him from peeping on girls with that
thing but only if you defeat me in a battle."</p><p>"Sure
come on baa-Chan."</p><p>"Kid
get ready to loose badly."</p><p>They
went outside and stood in front of each other</p><p>"Ready
to be defeated."</p><p>"You can't

a special card up my sleeve."</p><p>"And
what would that be hmmm."</p><p>"Well I
actually got 5 cards but you will find out when its time."</p><p>Tsunade
rushed forward and tried to hit Naruto in the face Naruto jumped backwards and
did his trademark jutsu</p><p><u>kage bunshen no jutsu</u></p><p>and created 10 clones the
fight went on more than 15 minutes before Tsunade got a crippling punch in on Naruto
and sent him into the wall</p><p>"Seems
like I win gaki."</p><p>"I am
not so sure I didn't even use a fifth of my power so shall we take it up a
notch eh?"</p><p>"Hmm
sure thing gaki if you got a death wish."</p><p>As he
slowly stood up he and took of the weights he was using before he put his hands
in the tora seal suddenly the ground started to shake as red fire sprouted from
the ground</p><p><u>Ichibi
kai</u></p><p>Said Naruto
and suddenly he was enveloped in fire as it started to take shape as armour
around Naruto and a blood red tail switched behind him</p><p>"K-K-K-Kyuubi's
chakra but h-how did you let him get access to that?!"</p><p>"I let
my self in on it now feel my power."</p><p>As he
looked up on her there in his eye where one tomo in each eye and what looked
like a cart wheel that the tomo was stuck on (like the sharingan but with lines
going thru it)</p><p>"What
the hell I thought he was a Namikaze not a Uchia?!"</p><p>"He is
a Namikaze and that's not Sharingan its Sharkagan."</p><p>"So
are you ready to loose or do you want to postpone your defeat?"</p><p>"I
need to get things in order first so in a week at the castle ruins."</p><p>"Sure."</p><p>As the
chakra died down Naruto went to the hotel</p><p>One
week later at the castle ruins</p><p>"So
you have come Tsunade kukuku."</p><p>"Yea
but i am not alone."</p><p>As Naruto
and Jiraya reached her suddenly two people in red clouds dropped from the trees</p><p>"So we
meet again Jiraya."</p><p>"Itachi."</p><p>"Give
us the kid and no one will be hurt."</p><p>"Forget
it Itachi."</p><p>" Hey Jiraya
don't interfere with what i am going to do my "mom" hates Uchias with a passion."</p><p>"How
would you know your parents are dead."</p><p>"Not
my biological parents but my adopted mother."</p><p>As he
raced thru the hand seals red chakra started to leak out and a loud growl was
heard as Naruto shouted</p><p><b><u>Kuchiyose no Jutsu</u></b></p><p>And a
huge smoke enveloped the area as the smoke clear stood in all its glory (minus
four tails) Kyuubi and on top of its head Naruto</p><p>"Hello
