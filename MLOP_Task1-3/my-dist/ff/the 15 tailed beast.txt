The villagers were about to beat me like they do every year and POOF he was there right in front of me. "Why are you about to beat this boy."</p><p>"This is not a boy but the 9 Tailed Beast." said some one said.</p><p>"This is not my sister. He is her jailor." he said to the mob of people wanting to beat Naruto.</p><p>"You can not be the 9 tails brother, you are not a demon."</p><p>"Oh, but I am, and I consider little Naruto here my brother, so if you try to hurt him, I will take it as a threat to me, and kill you. UNDERSTAND?!" he asked. All the villagers ran. He then turned to Naruto reaching for him. When Naruto cringed away he was surprised. " How long."he asked.</p><p>Understanding what he meant "All my life, always on my birthday." Naruto said.</p><p>"I'm not going to hurt you, little brother, and I'm not going to let them hurt you ever again, I swear." the man said as he put Naruto on his back "Let's go see the Hokage."</p><p>*Later that night*</p><p>Knock " come in" When the man entered with Naruto on his back, now asleep, the third was worried. "If I may ask why do you have Naruto on your back?"</p><p>"I have him on my back because I saved him from a beating at the hands of your village. It seems this happens every year on his birthday."</p><p>"Thank you, may I ask your name?"</p><p>"I would rather not, you can call me 15 or The 15 Tailed Beast."</p><p>"But your not a tailed beast you are a normal man."</p><p>"No I am a tailed beast, I have come to tell my sister, The 9 Tails, that our king has died and that she is the new ruler."</p><p>"why not you?"</p><p>"We are mainly rlyed by our females, unless there aren't any that want to take over once the old ruler died, if that is the case the a male can take over, but must have a dughter to take over after he's gone. Since she is sealed in to young naruto here I will protect him until he can take his place as her king when she is unsealed."</p><p>"But won't that will kill naruto."</p><p>"Demon are much better at seals than human so no."</p><p>"Ok but how long until naruto can take his place as king?''</p><p>"about 15 years. now it's gitting late. I must go, but before I do I must ask that I become a jonin, since I'm a full blooded demon I don't think that will be a problem, will it?"</p><p>"no just let me get the papers filled out but for now just sigh here" said Sarutobi pulling out some papers. After 15 signed the third pulle out a jonin vest saying "welcome to the Konoha ninja force Jonin Kun Laki*." When 15 heard the name he tilted he's head in confusion. "I had you make a cover name. Now good night Kun."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>*pronounced Koon La key</p>
