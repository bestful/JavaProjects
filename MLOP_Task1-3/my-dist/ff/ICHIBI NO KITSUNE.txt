met this kid, we played for a little bit, he was nice and he let me
have a cookie, but then this man came came out, and he called me some
things that I don't know the meanings of, then he kicked me in the
side, and started throwing kunia at me, so I run all the way back
home." </B>ichibi
blurted out in one breath</P><P><B>"Where
they just kids, or did they wear the hitaiate of konoha?" </B>kyuubi
asked calmly<B>, "and
didn't I tell you not to go near the kits of the humans?"</B></P><P><B>"The
older one did where the mark of the shinobi, yes", </B>said
ichibi, then added <B>"but

while you where out talking to the kage in your human form about the
shortage in the payments this month."</B></P><P><B>"Ok,
I'll be going to talk to the kage about this, you want to come, tell
it to him?"</B></P><P><B>"Really,
go into the village? and meet the kage-sama?"</B></P><P><B>"Ichibi,
little one, do not call him 'sama', he is not your better and after
what his man did to you he deserves no respect."</B></P><P><B>"Hai,

demon-sama", I called to the demon in human form, as I ran to
catch up with him, "may I trouble you for directions?"</P><P><B>"Sure,
what do you need?", </B>he
replied, waiting for me to catch up before we continued on.</P><P>"I'm
headed for konoha and was attacked a while back, in the confusion I
got turned around, am I still on the right road?"</P><P><B>"Hai,
you are, can I ask what your business is and your name, human-sama?"</B></P><P><B>"</B>Hai,
I am Chaarusu, and I am going to konoha to seek a new home".</P><P><B>"Do
you have a clan name, what country are you from?"</B></P><P><B>"</B>I
had a clan name, until diseases wiped most of us out, me and my
brother are the only ones remaining, and we went our separate way to
start in the hopes of starting new clans, may I ask your name
demon-sama?"</P><P><B>"AAA,
such politeness feels so good after so long, thank you very much, I
am kyuubi no kitsune, and this is my kit, ichibi", </B>he
said motioning, with obvious pride, to the little sleeping orange
ball of fur in his arm.</P><P>"Your
very welcome, it is an honor to meet you Kyuubi-sama, and may I add
your kit is very cute, you most be very proud of him", I replied
with a smile.</P><P>"<B>Thank
you, and yes I am very proud of him, I am going to talk to the hokage
myself, would you like to come along as my guest?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
it would be an honor, and if I get permission to live here, please
know I will alway be proud to be of service to you in any way I can"</P><P>"<B>Thank
you, I might take you up on that, but do think you could handle a
growing demon kit for a couple hours?"</B></P><P><B>"</B>Well,
I'd be more then happy to try, especially such a cute one, can he do
his human form yet?"</P><P><B>"No,
he can't yet, but you can imagine is been hard to find a babysitter
from around here, the humans around here are getting so full of pride
they have no respect for the one who protects them anymore, oh, and
how do you know about the kistune ability to go into human form?"</B></P><P>"I
made it a point to learn about the place before traveling here, I'm
glad your the first one met, it will save me the trouble of trying to
find you, after I get a place to stay, I was going to find you and
ask permission to reside in your land".</P><P><B>"You
are a shinobi right, I mean that is how you could tell I was demon
even in my human form?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
I am"</P><P><B>"Then
why do you not stay in your village?"</B></P><P>"Because
I have no village my clan was a clan of nomadic ninja, we never had a
village"</P><P><B>"In
that case you have my permission to reside in the fire country as
long as you wish"</B></P><P>"Thank
you Kyuubi-sama"</P><P>"<B>Also
if you are in need of a job, would you like to be my kits playmate
and caretaker?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
that would be great, I have something I think would come in handy for
that"</P><P><B>"What
is it?"</B></P><P>"In
a way it's a weapon, but don't worry, it has a much better use.",
that being said I pull out a deck of cards form a pocket inside my
coat, "These chakra cards hold boundless knowledge about so many
different subjects, this deck alone is just the directory, I also
have a deck of stories, jutsus, songs, weaponry, and others."</P><P><B>"Wow,
I have heard of a wayward clan that uses these cards but I thought it
was just a myth, or story, is...umm...was that your clan?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
but they used it mostly for weaponry, not for knowledge, and only the
clan leader was able use the cards of knowledge"</P><P>"<B>So
you where there leader?"</B></P><P><B>"</B>No,
I was just the heir, and was just learning to use the cards of
knowledge, when the sickness struck, my father who was the leader at
that time.He was one of the first to die, also I wasn't good enough
with them at that time to save my clan. See the cards are kind of
like an attachment to a very limited bloodline, and only the eldest
living son of the clan leader could unlock it."</P><P><B>"Very
interesting, but how could that help ichibi", </B>he
asked looking down at his still sleeping kit with a broad proud grin.</P><P>"I
can copy the knowledge into him, you see the best mind to put
knowledge into is a young demon because the minds stay softer, longer
then the human mind, so they are easier to teach, also demons have a
greater brain capabilities"</P><P><B>"I
see, very good, I'm impressed by a human for the fist time in quite a
while"</B></P><P>"Thank
you", as I bowed.</P><P><B>"But
there is just one thing, you will have to take my mark"</B></P><P>"Which
mark did you have in mind for me heaven, hell, or earth?"</P><P><B>"The
kitsune heaven mark, are you familiar with it?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
it will make me almost invincible, in exchange for you being able to
summon me at a whim. Age and disease will not harm me, in exchange
for my loyalty, and advice. And I will be able to call on your
chakra, in exchange for you being able to telepathically kill me if I
disobey you."</P><P><B>"Are
you willing?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
with one condition though"</P><P><B>"Ok,
what?"</B></P><P>"My
children will not be forced to have the mark unless they choose to.
And they don't get to choose to until there wedding day, the same
goes for there children and so on for ever, agreed?"</P><P>"<B>Agreed,
but first I need to ask ichibi,Ii'd rather not do it if he isn't
gonna like you, ok?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
sounds like a good plan. Is that the konoha? It's big. Also, I will
need land outside the village to build my home on"</P><P>"<B>But
of course, we will talk of your job and the mark with ichibi, after
we talk with the hokage, then depending on the outcome I will give
you as much land as you need, also as my freind, you will be able to
enter to any village in fire country."</B></P><P>"Thank
you Kyuubi-sama", as i bowed again.</P><P><B>"Your
very welcome, and remember, as my friend you will bow to nobody else,
ok"</B></P><P>"Hai,
thank you for this honor"</P><P><B>"Yeah,
we are here, hold your head up straight and don't be surprised if
people bow to you, which they might when they see you sanding beside
me in my non-human forms, but only the shinobi will be able tell who
I am in human form"</B></P><P>"Hai"</P><P>We
continued in silence through the gate and to the kages office where
he was waiting for Kyuubi-sama. He frowned at me and then looked
questioningly at Ichibi-sama who was still sound asleep in his
fathers arms.</P><P>111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111</P><P><B>POV(HOKAGE-SAMA)</B></P><P>Kyuubi
walked in with a smile, but still holding his usual sense of
arrogance'</P><P><B>"Yodaime-baka,
this is chaarusu, he will be residing in or around konoha, yosh"</B>,
Kyuubi demanded, and nodded his head towards the man beside him.</P><P>I
studied him a bit before saying ok and handing him the proper forms
to fill out.</P><P>He was
about six feet tall. He wore black shorts that come down to his
knees, with a red and green dragon wrapped around the left leg. The
lower part of his legs where wrapped in orange bandages. A open
mid-thigh length denim trench coat with onefull left sleeve, but no
right sleeve covered most of an orange and blue camo low cut muscle
shirt, and under that was black fishnet. He was barefoot and probably
had been since birth. His wild green tipped blue hair was held out of
his face by his hitaiate, which had a symbol I was not familiar with.</P><P>I
stared into his flame red eyes and asked, "What is your clan
name?"</P><P>Here
he walk over to whisper in Kyuubi's ear, and whatever he said brought
smile to Kyuubi's face as he nodded his affirmation.</P><P>Chaarusu
turned back to me and stated with a smile, "Kitsune, my name is
Kitsune Chaarusu."</P><P>Stunned
I raised an eyebrow, and thought, 'what ties does he have with
Kyuubi, to take on his name?'</P><P>"Will
you be staying with us as a civilian or a shinobi?", I asked.</P><P>Here
Kyuubi broke in, <B>"He
will be in my employment, however, you may use him when I don't need
him, for a fee that is."</B></P><P>Chaarusu
smiled a stupidly wide grin, and nodded like an idiot.</P><P>"Yosh,
Chaarusu would you be available for a test spar to see your strength
at six tomorrow evening?"</P><P><B>"Yes,
he will", </B>Kyuubi
answered as chaarusu still smiled stupidly wide.</P><P>"Yosh,
you will be fighting our shinobi named kakashi"</P><P>"Aaaaaa,
Kakashi-san, it will be nice to battle him again."</P><P>"You
know him?"</P><P>"Hai,
we met eight years ago, he was a chuunin of twelve at the time. I
hear he has been given a sharingan eye, how is that working for him?"</P><P>"WOW"</P><P>Suddenly
a snicker broke out of Kyuubi's face, and quickly turns into a full
belly laugh as he handed the ball of orange ball of fur he had in his
arms over to Chaarusu before he fell over in spasms of laughing.</P><P>'Good
thing he is in human form, I'd hate to see him laugh like that in his
normal form', I shuddered to myself.</P><P><B>"BAKA,
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN YOUR FACE, AND YOUR STUPID WEAK "wow</B>",
Kyuubi blurted between two gasps, while Chaarusu and the now wide
wake Ichibi watched in amusement.</P><P><B>"What
happened", </B>Ichibi
asked Chaarusu<B>,
"and who are you, also why are you holding me?"</B></P><P><B>"</B>Everything
is ok Ichibi-sama", chaarusu responded, "Baka-sama made a
funny face in response to an answer I gave him, and Kyuubi-sama
started laughing"</P><P><B>"But,
who are you?"</B></P><P>"Oh,
yeah, sorry, I'm gonna be your new teacher and playmate, if you want
me to be that is."</P><P><B>"A
playmate awsome, how much is dad paying you?", </B>he
inquired rather bluntly</P><P>."We
haven't talk that part over yet, we wanted to see your reaction to me
first."</P><P><B>"I'm
sorry little one, I didn't mean to wake you up so suddenly"</B>,
Kyuubi said to Ichibi.</P><P><B>"It's
ok papa, besides this is where we were headed, right?"</B></P><P><B>"Hai,
now yodaime-baka we have a problem, it seems that as ichibi was
playing in the forest of death, he started playing with one of the
village kits... how old would you say ichibi?"</B></P><P><B>"Oh,
about eight years old, and he gave me a cookie, so don't get him in
trouble, ok papa?"</B></P><P><B>"Don't
worry little one, I hold nothing against the kit, if I knew who it
was I would bless him."</B></P><P><B>"It
was an uchiha boy, with long black hair, and he had active and
partially formed sharingan eyes"</B></P><P><B>"Must
have been itachi, we will stop by and bless them on our way out of
town"</B></P><P><B>"Ok,
thanks papa"</B></P><P><B>"Hai,
now back too the subject at hand...while he was playing with itachi,
a man attacked him, called him things, kicked him in the side and
chased him with kunai"</B></P><P>"I
see, does Ichibi-sama know who it was, and or what they looked like",
I asked.</P><P><B>"Yes,
I know what he looks like baka"</B>,
Ichibi snapped.</P><P>"Mind
telling me?", feeling rather dejected</P><P><B>"He
was a broad shouldered man, and he wore a brown hooded robe, over
blue spandex type jumpsuit, red shinobi sandals, and a konoha
hitaiate. his eyes were dark blue, and his hair was black. Also
though he didn't use it, he had a bo staff on his back"</B></P><P>"Yes,
I know who it is, and he will be put in jail when he gets back from
the mission he is on. Is there anything else?"</P><P><B>"YES",</B>
Kyuubi roared,<B>"I
want this man turned over to me, I think he will make a good lesson
for ichibi, I will send chaarusu to get him in a week, understood?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
Kyuubi-sama, is that all?", I asked eyeing the whole other desk
of paperwork to my left.</P><P><B>"Yes,
that is all, we will be back tomorrow for the fight"</B></P><P>"Yosh,
I will inform kakashi"</P><P>And
without another word they left, Ichibi still in Chaarusu's arms, and
I went back to my paperwork.</P><P>111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111</P><P>A/N:

PERSON)</B></P><P>It
had been stressful day at the at the Uchiha compound, Itachi was
banished to</P><P>the
courtyard for shuriken and kunai practice, while his dad was trying
to calm</P><P>down
his spring cleaning and pregnant mother.</P><P>"Itachi,
come in, clean up, and come to the living room", his father
called to him.</P><P>"Hai",
he stated flatly, as his last kunai embed its tip in the bullseye on
the post</P><P>he
was aiming for.</P><P>'Probable
some more damn girls that dad wants me to take interest in. Kami</P><P>dad,
I'm only eight, and not a freaking horse to be bred', he complained
in his</P><P>head
as he went to clean up.</P><P>After
cleaning up he went to his room; put on a blue kimono with a red obi,
and</P><P>an
uchiha fan on the back. 'Some day I will brake away from these
formalities', he</P><P>more
so asked to himself then thought</P><P>"Might
as well get this over with", as he attached the katana of the
firstborn, and</P><P>left
for the living room.</P><P>He
was quite surprised to see two man he didn't know, and his little fox
friend</P><P>from
yesterday.</P><P><B>"Hello,
Itachi-sama"</B>,
said the man that looked like an average, generic</P><P>chunnin
in a voice to large for him.</P><P>"Hello
Kyuubi-sama", as he took his place in the circle on the floor,
the others</P><P>where
seated in.</P><P><B>"AAA,
you have a very bright boy here Fugaku-san, by the </B></P><P><B>way,
how is your wife doing, I hear she is with child again"</B></P><P>"Thank
you, kyuubi-sama, he is", Itachi's dad replied, "And Mikoto
is doing very</P><P>good,
for an eight month pregnant women with a sudden attack of spring</P><P>cleaning
fever. Please, forgive her for not being here, she was tired and went
to</P><P>lay
down for a nap"</P><P><B>"HAI,
I know how it is, aren't they so beautiful when they get </B></P><P><B>that
way?"</B></P><P>"Yeah,
may I ask what you want with Itachi?"</P><P><B>"We
want to bless him for his kindness"</B>,
Ichibi chimes as he jumps</P><P>into
Itachi's lap, and smiled as Itachi started scratching his ears.</P><P><B>"Hai,
Itachi, Ichibi; go play in the courtyard, I need to talk to </B></P><P><B>Fugaku-san
for a bit"</B>,
Kyuubi dismissed the young, <B>"Chaarusu
go </B></P><P><B>with
them, please".</B></P><P>"Hai",
Chaarusu answered leading kid and kit out.</P><P>Kyuubi
couldn't help but smile as heard Ichibi ask if there was any cookies
left,</P><P>and
the sigh that followed a negative response.</P><P>"Kindness,
huh? I've seen the boy show amazing kindness before, but never</P><P>heard
someone outside the family describe him as anything but cold. So,
forgive</P><P>me
for being lost."</P><P><B>"Hai,
he is an Uchiha alright, huh?", </B>Kyuubi
laughed.</P><P>"Yeah,
you got me there Kyuubi-san", Fugaku smiled, "now will you
explain?"</P><P><B>"Well,
yesterday my Ichibi was play in the forest of death, </B></P><P><B>and
met Itachi, and though he didn't know who he was at the </B></P><P><B>time,
he had a playmate for a little bit...before a man chased </B></P><P><B>him
that is. But anyways, it would seem itachi has touch my </B></P><P><B>little
one's heart, and I would like to bless him. And also </B></P><P><B>extend
an invitation for Itachi to study with Ichibi every day,</B></P><P><B>I
believe both would benefit from it."</B></P><P>"What
type of blessing did you have in mind?"</P><P><B>"I
wanted to unlock his mangekyo sharingan"</B></P><P>"WHAT??
... how?"</P><P><B>"Do
you know how the sharingan came to be?"</B></P><P>"I
know the theories pasted down though generations, nothing more"</P><P><B>"Ok,
I'll tell you, I can because i was there"</B></P><P>"Interesting,
I always was curious"</P><P><B>"Ok,
in the time ruled by my father, and when I was a kit a </B></P><P><B>little
older then ichibi. The Hyuga clan, and the byakugan </B></P><P><B>were
around. There was a maiden from that clan that fell in </B></P><P><B>love
with a demon of the kitsune clan. He was a nibi at the time.</B></P><P><B>There
son obito no kitsune, was the first user of the sharigan.</B></P><P><B>He
started the Amaterasu</B>
<B>clan
because he was born with the </B></P><P><B>mangekyo
sharingan and invented the two jutsus that can </B></P><P><B>only
be used after an uchiha unlocks the mangekyo, the</B></P><P><B>amaterasu,
and tsukuyomi. No one of the Amaterasu clan </B></P><P><B>sence
has been born with the mangekyo, and because of this</B></P><P><B>the
clan changed it's name to Uchiha five hundred years </B></P><P><B>latter,
because fire jutsus work well with the sharigan.</B></P><P><B>Another
thousand years, and they found out how to unlock </B></P><P><B>the
mangekyo, the whole clan almost died before the secret </B></P><P><B>of
the mangekyo was locked away to all but the heads of the </B></P><P><B>clan.
But...what isn't known to them is that a demon of the </B></P><P><B>kitsune
clan can unlock an Uchiha's mangekyo without having </B></P><P><B>to
kill his best friend, or driving them crazy."</B></P><P>"Wow...so
the Uchiha's are a branch of the Hyuga?"</P><P><B>"Hai"</B></P><P>"How
long does it take, and is it painful?"</P><P><B>"It
takes about ten minutes, and involves a bite and a lot of </B></P><P><B>staring,
so it's a little painful, that is why I wanted to talk to </B></P><P><B>you
about it first"</B></P><P>"Thank
you for the consideration, but the choice is up to Itachi"</P><P><B>"Hai,
thank you fugaku-san</B>.
A<B>lso, if
he wants to I'm gonna </B></P><P><B>have
Ichibi do it, that should strengthen the bond between </B></P><P><B>them,
because there is an emotional, and somewhat telepathic </B></P><P><B>link
that sometimes happens when this ceremony is </B></P><P><B>performed."</B></P><P>"So
it is going to be public?"</P><P><B>"I
believe that would be best. I mean how would it look, an </B></P><P><B>eight
year old boy unlocking a dangerous bloodline that </B></P><P><B>usually
takes the murdering of his best friend?"</B></P><P>"Hai,
I see what you mean, very well. Given his consent, when would you
wont to</P><P>do
it?"</P><P><B>"We
will be coming into town tomorrow for Chaarusu's fight </B></P><P><B>with
kakashi, and the fight is at six"</B>,
Kyuubi said thoughtfully, <B>"so
if he </B></P><P><B>decides
by then we could make it for seven in the evening, also </B></P><P><B>be
sure to invite the hokage, he will be a powerful ally if </B></P><P><B>people
start being stupid toward Itachi, yosh?"</B></P><P>"Yosh"</P><P><B>"Ichibi,
Chaarusu, say good bye"</B>,
Kyuubi yelled, <B>"it's

had just stopped convulsing, put on his boxers, and was sitting</P><P>putting
on a device on his left wrist. When a kunai dug into the ground a
couple</P><P>inches
from the most painful place it could go on a male.</P><P>"What
the damn shit hell", he yelled securing the final latch on his
device, "geez,</P><P>I
gotta keep those".</P><P><B>"Calm
down, if she'd wanted to hit you, she would have"</B></P><P>"She,
she who?"</P><P><B>"Ok,
anko, you can come out now"</B></P><P>Anko
came out from behind the bush she was hiding behind. Walking up to</P><P>Chaarusu,
"Hello sexy", she said as she pulled up on his balls.</P><P>"Hello
bitch", he replied getting dressed.</P><P>"Bitch,
huh?", Anko said throwing a kunai.</P><P>"Yes,
but a very good looking one", deflecting the kunai with his
right pointer</P><P>finger
and licking his lips.</P><P>"Wow,
sexy and powerful. Deflected a wind chakra kunai."</P><P>"It
isn't hard to do, any genin from my former clan could have"</P><P>"What
village you from, I'm not familiar with the symbol on your hitaiate."</P><P>"I'm
from a clan nomadic village, that was known as the village hidden in</P><P>silence",
he stated, grabbing another kunai Anko had just thrown out of the
air, and</P><P>throwing
it back so fast that anko couldn't dodge. It stabbed into her sternum
with</P><P>a
loud crack.</P><P>"D...Damn
you...y..your amazing", she shuddered as she pulled the kunai
out of</P><P>her
chest, "I wonder h..how you are in bed?"</P><P>"I
wouldn't know, I've never tried it"</P><P>"Damn,
i..it keeps getting better"</P><P>"You
want me to take you to the hospital? That doesn't look good."</P><P>"Duh
i...i...It's bad, hit my ste...sternum"</P><P>"Yeah,
and my chakra went through", he replied as she coughed up blood.</P><P>"Ok,
take me to the hospital, I don't feel to well", as she
collapsed.</P><P>"She's
a beauty, isn't she Kyuubi?", chaarusu stated as he caught her.</P><P><B>"Yeah,
I thought you would think so, that's why I asked her to </B></P><P><B>come.
Shouldn't you get her to the hospital?"</B></P><P>"Nah,
I can heal her here."</P><P><B>"Then
why offer it"</B></P><P>"Oh,
yeah, just walk up to her 'hey baby, let me heal your chest a minute.
Now</P><P>please
take your shirt off', like that would go well. Also, legally, I'm not
certified."</P><P><B>"Oh,
I see. Though she probably would have let you."</B></P><P>Chaarusu
started drawing a circle in the dirt, with several symbols around it,</P><P>and
a pentagram inside of that while asking, "The healing, or the

likely"</B></P><P>"Hn",
he grunted as he placed anko in the pentgram to where her hands,

red.</P><P>The
symbols started spinning faster, and faster until they where like a
solid band</P><P>which
faded into gold. Slowly the band began to shrink until it was about
six</P><P>inches
wide and centered on Anko's chest. Chaarusu pilled a vial of red
liquid out</P><P>of
his coat and let a single drop fall onto her chest.</P><P>"Ok,
five minutes", he stated as the gold band faded into Anko's
chest, and</P><P>the

was that in the vial?"</B></P><P>"A
mixture of my ancestors blood, angel blood, demon blood, and vampire

old ones are the best."</B></P><P>"Yep,
because they have been test over thousands of years."</P><P><B>"How
good of a healing will it be?"</B></P><P>"If
I did it right, complete healing."</P><P><B>"Cool,
how does it work?"</B></P><P>"Don't

that</P><P>was
kept out of the cards of knowledge."</P><P><B>"Ok...she's
coming around."</B></P><P>"Oh,
good, that's good", he said kneeling over her.</P><P>"Hello

healed you, bitch"</P><P>"Cool",
she said smiling into his flame red eyes.</P><P>"I
like you bitch", he said then was startled by the hand on his
neck that pulled</P><P>his
lips down into hers.</P><P>Two
minutes latter she let him go, "Love you too, will you be my
man?"</P><P>"Geez,
you move fast, but I'll give it a try", he smiled back.</P><P>"YES,

pulled him</P><P>into
another two minute kiss.</P><P><B>"Hey
you two, get a room before you get arrested"</B></P><P>"Don't
worry Kyuubi, this is as far as we are going for now."</P><P><B>"Ok,
but you should probably get a room anyways, your </B></P><P><B>gonna
need as much sleep as you can got for tomorrows </B></P><P><B>fight."</B></P><P>"Right,
I forgot", chaarusu started.</P><P><B>"I
can't blame you, a female like Anko could knock anything </B></P><P><B>out
of any guys mind"</B></P><P>Chaarusu
turn a nice dark shade of maroon, as Anko jumped on him and</P><P>hugged
him around the neck in such a way the pushed his face into her large</P><P>breasts.
He could smell her, she smelled so nice, and it was driving him
crazy.</P><P>So
he did the only thing he could think of: he wrapped his arms around
her, pulled</P><P>her
hard close to him, and kissed her hard where his face was on her
chest.</P><P><B>"Hey,
really, get a bloody room."</B></P><P>Pulling
his face away from anko, Chaarusu said, "Ok, Kyuubi, can bitch
stay with</P><P>me
where ever you put me up?"</P><P><B>"Yeah,
I planned on it", </B>Kyuubi
smiled, and then whistled. At which a</P><P>Yonibi

the</P><P>place.</P><P><B>"Yonbi,
take the couple to there room please"</B></P><P><B>"Hai,

cards.</P><P>"Why?"</P><P>"Because

can do it yes, and how isn't important, if we don't get it off,

he can't kill me telepathically like with the mark you have."</P><P>"I
know, but when Orochimaru dies you will die soon afterwards, do you
feel</P><P>sick?
Blurriness of vision? Stomach ache? Unexplainable cuts?"</P><P>"No,
why?"</P><P>"OK,
we got time then, but tell me if it starts, ok?"</P><P>"Love,
your not making any sense."</P><P>Here

stared back into his eyes, her jaw working," H...h...how did he
die?"</P><P>"I

HOW did he die, in pain?</P><P>"Hell
yeah he was in pain for days."</P><P>"Good",
she said with an evil grin, "What did he do to you?"</P><P>"He
infected my clan, it wiped out all but me, my brother, and an old man
that died</P><P>four
years latter."</P><P>"I
see. How do we get this off?", as she covered the seal with her
left hand.</P><P>"A
jutsu I have, it's related to the one I healed you with earlier, but
it cleans</P><P>instead
of heals.", he answered as he pulled the vital of red liquid
out, and put the</P><P>coat
on. "Put some cloths on , if you want to."</P><P>"What,
you don't like seeing me undressed?"</P><P>"Yeah,
I do. But I'd rather you didn't go outside without them."</P><P>"Oh,

UNDERSTAND?</p><P>"HAI", cried all three other
shinobi.</p><P>"OK, COME TO THE CENTER OF THE
FIELD AND SHAKE HANDS"</p><P>The three obeyed coming to the center
and shaking hands.</p><P>444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444<B>POV(THIRD
PERSON)</B></p><P>"OK, COME TO THE CENTER OF THE
FIELD AND SHAKE HANDS"</p><P>The three obeyed coming to the center
and shaking hands.</p><P>"Kakashi-san, it's been a long
time", Chaarusu said as he shook his hand.</p><P>"Chaarusu, is that you, I didn't
realize it would be you. When did yo change your last name?"</p><P>"Shortly after I met the hokage,
I registered under this name because I'm to be the teacher of
kyuubi's son, and i'm starting a new clan.", here he pulls Anko,
who had been following close behind him, out of her hiding
spot,"Speaking of which, this is my wife. Ain't she beautiful?"</p><P>"Damn, your not even officially
in member of the village, and you have already stolen the pretties
girl around. Hi Anko, how you doing?"</p><P>"Hi Kashi, I've been good",
she replied with a blush, as Chaarusu grinned widely.</p><P>"So, do we fight as friends?",
Kakashi asked the couple.</p><P>"HAI", they replied in
unison.</p><P>"They lets get it going, looser
treats to dinner at Ichiraku Ramen Bar."</p><P>"Yosh, good luck", they
replied, as each walked to their end of the field.</p><P>The referee was had his hand raised,
and was about say begin, but was interrupted by a scream of "stop"
from the hokage.</p><P>"Hokage-sama, what is the
problem?", asked the ref.</p><P>"Chaarusu can't have help in this
fight, so his partner will have to get off the field."</p><P>"Actually, he can, it is the law
of the shinobi. You cannot force a man and wife not to fight
together, or to accept separate missions."</p><P>"SO"</p><P>"So Chaarusu was married by me,
to Anko early this morning."</p><P>"Without my approval?"</p><P>"He had the approval of the
resident demon lord, so he didn't need your approval."</p><P>"DAMN", he yelled, "proceed.</p><P>"BEGIN", the referee cried,
letting his hand fall.</p><P>Chaarusu turned to Anko,"Swallow
this pill without biting it", he said handing her a pill. She
took it and swallowed it.</p><P>"Kakashi, I will give you a
chance now to forfeit."</p><P>"Like hell dragon boy."</p><P>"Very well.", Chaarusu
replied, "but let me show you something?"</p><P>Chaarusu lifted his hands into the ram
seal, but instead of focusing chakra, he pulled his hands apart about
six inch. With each hand he started doing one handed seals. Kakashi
went into a defensive stance when he saw this.</p><P>'Damn, he's fast, I'm going to have to
use it', Kakashi thought as he lifted his hitaiate up from over his
sharingan eye.</p><P>"Ninpou:nibai hinan; toku no za
mitsukai katsu chi ryu no za akki(1)", Chaarusu yelled, as a
blue barrier appeared in a dome over him and Anko, and a six foot
dragon came up from the dirt in front of the barrier. The dragon shot
dirt and rock out of it's mouth at Kakashi and then disappeared in
smoke.</p><P>"Dang, kawariyaku", chaarusu
complained at the log that was once Kakashi.</p><P>"Kage shuriken", Kakashi
yelled from nowhere, and hundreds of shuriken embedded themselves
into the barrier before all but the original vanished into smoke.</p><P>"Damn, that is a strong barrier",
Kakashi mumbled going through hand seals, and yelling, "Chi
sanpomichi(3)!"</p><P>"Going underground huh?",
Chaarusu called out to him,"Not a good move, I am a metal
chackra type."</p><P>"What is metal chakra",
seemed to reverberate from the ground.</p><P>"Talking while underground, even
worse move", he uncovered the device on his left arm, made a
fist and pointed it at an angle at the ground, and stated
coldly,"Kai"</p><P>The instant he said the word his arm
moved but like it was absorbing shock (think like when someone shoots
a pistol) as something flew out of the device so fast that one
couldn't tell what it was, or how big it was. A few second after it
impacted and went underground a deafening loud scream was heard.</p><P>"OH, SHIT", Chaarusu yelled
looking at the device,"I forgot to take the power down."</p><P>He flew into hand seals as he started
sinking into the ground, "Anko, get a medic down here NOW, I'll
be back in a minute."</p><P>"h...HAI", Anko answered
running from the arena.</p><P>"Declare this fight over ref, we
have an emergency here."</p><P>"Hai", the ref wispered,
then screamed," THIS FIGHT IS OVER, KITSUNE, CHAARUSU IS THE
WINNER. THAT DECISION IS FINAL.", as he ran to a nearby
emergency phone to tell the hospital to be ready for anything.</p><P>The seconds seemed like days as the
twenty people present run down into the arena to help, but all they
could do is wait.</p><P>Seeing Tsunade coming down the stairs,
Anko ran up to her, "Come quick, Chaarusu-kun said to get a
medic, FAST"</p><P>"I'm coming Anko calm down."</p><P>Three minutes pasted before Chaarusu's
head slowly came back above ground, followed by his shoulders and and
an unconscious Kakashi.</p><P>"Wazatorashii shunmin no
jutsu(4).", Tsunade said flatly as she placed one hand on the
top of both their heads, making them drift off to sleep. And she gave
them both a looking over, but seeing that chaarusu was fine, she
released him.</p><P>"Anko, he will be groggy for
about fifteen minutes. Keep him calm"</p><P>"HAI"</p><P>"However, Kakashi is another
story. His spine has been severed. I want to know what it was your
husband did to him, he may never walk again, even with healing. Also
some of his internal damage to his organs. And a numbing type agent
that I'm not familiar with, it will take a couple day to find a cure,
unless your husband has one."</p><P>"I don't know what he did, I'm
not familiar with all his techniques yet. As for a cure, I have no
idea."</p><P>"Will he live", Chaarusu
injected tiredly.</p><P>"Yes, he will live, but he may
never fight again. What the HELL did you do to him?", Tsunade
ask very mad.</p><P>"I forgot to take the power down
on my technique."</p><P>"FORGOT, that no excuse, you are
no longer welcome in this village."</p><P>"You can kick me out Tsunade, not
even the hokage can."</p><P>"Like hell, I'll kick you to the
moon if I want to."</p><P><B>"NO,
YOU WON'T TSUNADE, HE IS MY SERVENT, AND YOU WILL NOT HARM HIM."</B></p><P>"Hai,
demon-lord", she replies, than turns to Chaarusu,"kuberu o
makai.(5)"</p><P>"After you bitch."</p><P><B>"ENOUGH,
ANKO GRAP THE SCARECROW, WE ARE LEAVING."</B></p><P>"Hai,
kyuubi-sama", she answered picking up Kakashi and following.</p><P>"Kyuubi, you are not taking my
shinobi with you.", Arashi stated.</p><P><B>"STOP
ME BAKA, HAVE THE REST OF THE MONTHLY PAYMENT READY BY THE NEXT TIME
I COME, OR THERE WILL BE HELL TO PAY."</B></p><P>"Don't
come back, or that is where I will send you."</p><P><B>"DON'T
THREATEN ME LITTLE MAN", HE REPLIED, THEN TURN TO ITACHI, "TELL
YOUR FATHER IT WILL HAVE TO BE ANOTHER DAY, I'M SORRY ITACHI-SAN."</B></p><P>"HAi, I understand, thank you
kyuubi-sama."</p><P>Then Kyuubi carrying Ichibi, and
followed by Anko and Chaarusu who where carrying Kakashi. On the way
to the kitsune mansion Chaarusu healed Kakashi with the same jutsu as
he healed Anko with, but since he was in more serious condition then
she was, the put him on a spare bed in the couples room so they could
keep an eye on them.</p><P>444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444444</p><P>(1)ninja arts: double attack;shield of

AM three days latter)555555555555555555555555</B></p><P><B>POV(Kakashi-san)</B></p><P>I woke up with my head in a major fog,
and a headache worse then any hang over I had ever had, and I've had
some pretty good hangovers before ,but that's beside the point.
Anyways I woke up with a big headache, in an unfamiliar place. This
caused me to instantly jump up, which I instantly regretted as I fell
to the bed weak as a baby. Then the door opened and Chaarusu walked
in.</p><P>"Oh, your up, that's good",
he said happily, then in a sad tone,"Kakashi-san, I am very
sorry, I didn't mean to cause you this pain. I never wanted to
severely hurt you, I forgot to take the power down on my device
before the fight. Can you forgive me?"</p><P>I couldn't help but pity him as I saw
the tears falling from his bowed head. So I replied,"I already
own you my live, you don't need to cry for me. I know you would never
intentionally put me into a deadly situation. Help me to a chair,
please?"</p><P>He helped me to a chair and sat me in
it.</p><P>"Now what the hell happen, one
minute a was asking a question, the next it felt like me guts was
ripped out."</p><P>"I used one of my old clan's
jutsus, but I forgot to regulate the power, so it was still on the
setting it was when I last used it.", he said uncovering the
device on his arm.</p><P>"How does it work?"</p><P>"Well, you see, my old clan used
chakra enhanced cards as shuriken, and a couple years after I met you
and Obito I found a way to make my shuriken cards fly at an alarming
rate. But it was hard to control, so I built this device which holds
a desk of chakra enhanced cards, and uses my chakra to throw them
very fast and accurately. Also just a couple years ago I found a way
to make it follow it's target and hit at a given point on it's body,
it can be very deadly."</p><P>"I can feel the deadly part",
I said with a smirk, causing him to smile,"I want to see this
device in action, without being the target, it is amazing."</p><P>"Ok, I could even build you one
if you want, but you gotta promise not to share it's power without
permission from me, ok?"</p><P>"Okay, I can do that", I
replied grinning.</p><P>"But now you need your rest. I'm
going to be going with Kyuubi to collect the rent from the
hokage-baka. Geez was he ever mad when we took you away, he
threatened to send kyuubi to hell if he went back into town."</p><P>"What, you have to stop
Kyuubi-sama from going into town!"</p><P>"Why?"</p><P>"Because, this means he has
finished the seal, and will use it on Kyuubi."</p><P>"What seal?"</p><P>"I don't know if he named it yet,
but it is able to seal a tailed demon into a young child, but it is
untested and could be very dangerous."</p><P>"This is bad, I must warn him",
he said, then yelled for Anko to come.</p><P>"Yes, love ", Anko said
stepping into the room.</p><P>"I have to warn Kyuubi, he is in
danger, has he left yet?"</p><P>"Yes, he left about ten minutes
ago, and said for you to catch up with him."</p><P>"DAMN, take care of Kakashi while
I'm gone, and keep Ichibi inside, ok?"</p><P>"HAI", she said with a
worried frown on her face, as Chaarusu run out to warn Kyuubi.</p><P><B>555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555555</B></p><P><B>POV(CHAARUSU)</B></p><P><I>Kyyyuuuuubiii,

SHIT MAN, I GOT NIN ALL AROUND ME, AND THEY ARE MAD!!</B></I></p><P><I>Ok,
hang in their, I'm coming as fast as I can. AND DON"T GO NEAR
THE HOKAGE!! </I></p><P><I><B>WHY
THE HELL NOT?</B></I></p><P><I>He
is gonna try to seal you!</I></p><P><I><B>OH
DAMN SHIT! WHAT THE HELL!</B></I></p><P><I>wWhat
happened?</I></p><P><I>What
happened, damn it</I></p><P>"Shit,
not good", I said as I stopped to see the Kyuubi's hugh chakra
form melting into a strange blue light that was coming from
Arashi-baka's hand. And flew through double one handed seals and
yelled,"KAIZAI NO ZA SHUGOREI!(1)"</p><P>As I said this two black dragon wings
came out of my back, my eyes became two dancing blue /green flames
and two chains flew out of each of my plams. One set of chains
wrapped around Kyuubi's form, stopping it from melting. And the other
set wrapped around Arashi and stopped the light. Time stopped as we
where pulled into another plane of existence along with the god of
death and the child that was at Arashi's feet.</p><P>"What the hell, it was working",
Arashi questioned, not realizing he wasn't in konoha any more, and
thinking his jutsu had just failed.</p><P><B>"OH,
IT DIDN'T FAIL ARASHI, IT WAS PAUSED BY THE ONLY BEING WHO COULD
PAUSE SUCH A SEAL"</B>, the god of death informed him,
then turns to me, <B>"IT'S
BEEN FIVE YEARS SINCE I SAW YOU LAST, I THOUGHT YOU HAD GIVEN UP ON
THIS PITIFUL HUMANS."</B></p><P>"NOT
LIKELY DEATH, MY VESSEL JUST WASN'T DONE TRAINING AFTER THE PREMATURE
DEATH OF HIS FATHER, SO IT TOOK A WHILE FOR ME TO AWAKEN."</p><P>"<B>WHAT
DO YOU WANT HERE?"</B></p><P>"I AM THE GUARDIAN OF THE
INNOCENT, AND KEEPER OF KNOWLEDGE. YOU DO NOT GET TO QUESTION ME",
I said spreading my wings and opening my mouth to let another chain
with a kunai on the end out like a long tongue, <I>I
HAVE THE RIGHT TO ANY HUMAN SOUL I CLAIM, AND THE RIGHT TO GET A NEW
GOD OF DEATH IF YOU STAND IN MY WAY</I></p><P><B>"PLEASE,
THAT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY"</B>, he pleaded, and I sucked
my tongue back in.</p><P>"I SEE YOU LEARNED FROM THE LAST
TIME", I smirked, "YOU WILL NOT BE CLAIMING A SOUL TODAY,
BE GONE."</p><P>"<B>HAI,
MY LORD"</B>, and he faded back into hell.</p><P><B>"CHAARUSU,
WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?"</B>, Kyuubi asked.</p><P>"I AM NOT CHAARUSU, I AM ZA
SHUGOREI. AND I AM SORRY THAT I AM TO LATE TO SAVE YOU KYUUBI, BUT
YOU ARE NOT IN MY PROTECTION. HOWEVER YOU SON WILL BE KEPT SAFE BY MY
VESSEL, YOU WILL STILL BE SEALED INTO THE CHILD AND THE CHILD WILL
ALSO BE RAISED BY MY VESSEL. ARASHI, YOUR SOUL WILL BE RIPPED FROM
YOU FOR WHAT YOU HAVE TRIED TO DO TO YOUR OWN SON, AND WHEN YOUR SON
HAS COME OF AGE HE WILL JUDGE YOUR SOUL. UNTIL HE DOES, YOUR SOUL
WILL BE SEALED INTO A BLADE, AND I WILL USE YOUR SOULS CHAKRA IN
BATTLES SO THAT YOU CAN'T BREAK FREE."</p><P><B>"HAI,
THANK YOU SHUGOREI-SAMA"</B>, Kyuubi replied as he faded
into the child's navel and was sealed.</p><P>"But all I did was protect my
village!"</p><P>"NO, ALL YOU DID WAS COVET THE
KYUUBI'S POWER, AND YOU WANTED TO USE THAT POWER TO CRUSH YOUR
ENEMIES."</p><P>"No!"</p><P>"YES!!", I replied as I
pulled on the chain that was wrapped around his soul, holding his
body with the other chain. He didn't have a chance to scream in pain,
he's soul was already ripped out, and his body turned to dust. I
pulled the chains back into my palms, taking the struggling soul of
the hokage with then, and went over to the child.</p><P>"I am sorry for what your father
has done to you", picking him up, and letting a single tear fall
on his forehead. The tear turned into a round birthmark in the middle
of his forehead, "my vessel will protect you, and you will have
my blessing."</p><P>My flaming eyes and my wings faded, as
time started up again.</p><P><I>kyuubi,
can you hear me?</I></p><P><I><B>YES,
BUT I NEED A LITTLE SPACE, YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THE SAFTY OF THAT
CHILD THERE.</B></I></p><P><I>HAI</I></p><P>"Where is the hokage?", a
stranger asked.</p><P>"He died sealing the kyuubi into
my son", I lied.</p><P>"What a shame, we must tell the
counsil."</p><P>"Go ahead, I need to think a
minute."</p><P>"Hai", he said, then turned
to the rest of the shinobi," everyone back to the village",
and they followed. I could think of nothing else to do, so I returned
to the kistune mansion.</p><P>5555555555555555555555(ONE HOUR LATTER,

came home two hours after leaving, and looked very tired, like he had
just run a couple marathons, and then walked around for three days.
His shoulders where slumped over, his head hung down on his chest and
tears where falling on whatever he had wrapped up in his coat.</p><P>Running out to meet him, I asked,
"What's the matter dear?"</p><P>"HUH?", he asked as his head
jerked up, "I must have falling asleep on my way here. Take the
little one inside and get him warm and feed, also send Ichibi out to
me.", he said handing me a naked baby and putting his coat back
on.</p><P>"h..hai", I said pained that
he hurt this much, but know what he asked must be important.</p><P>"Also if he can, ask Kakashi to
come out, I could use his help."</p><P>"hai", I said hugging him.
He pulled me tight and kissed me hard, and long.</p><P>"Thank you for being good to me."</p><P>"Hai, I love you Chaarusu."</p><P>"I love you to beautiful."</p><P>And I left to do as he asked, crying
because I know my mate way grieved very deeply. And fearing the worst
about Kyuubi.</p><P>55555555555555555555555(five minutes

before, when I carried a still sleeping Ichibi out to see him, I
almost broke up just seeing him. He sat on a log with his back to me,
his hand where holding his face, and his shoulders shook violently
with each sob. There where deep fist imprints on the log, and his
knuckles where bleeding, yet slowly healing before my eyes.</p><P>"Maybe it would be better to tell
him after he wakes up", I said sitting down next to Chaarusu,
still holding Ichibi.</p><P>"HAI, i don't think I can do it
now."</p><P>"I understand, did he suffer?"</p><P>"No, not as much as he could
have. Also the bastard no longer has his soul."</p><P>"Is it your first time killing?"</p><P>"A human yes, however he is still
alive, just his soul is sealed away for now."</p><P>"I see, then you cry for Kyuubi?"</p><P>"NO, I cry for the bastards son,
I cry for Ichibi, and I cry for all the innocent ones in the world."</p><P>"I take it your resident spirit
has awaken?"</p><P>"Yes, I awakened him."</p><P>"Your father once told me in my
short stay with him, 'Protect the innocent, live happy, and be a good
parent. Forget those you couldn't save, for they are beyond saving:
but as long as there is hope of saving never give up', be strong,
because Ichibi is going to need you, and so does your kid that will
be coming in about nine months."</p><P>"Arigato Kakashi-san, my fathers
words have always a comforted me."</p><P>"Your welcome ne-san, I'm going

versatile, and most know the true meaning of love."</p><P><B>"HAI, AND THEY
CAN BE STRONG, AND THEY KNOW HOW TO DREAM BIG."</B></p><P>"Ok, and now
the second thing I'm going to bring up. We need to pick a new clan
head, we need someone who can lead us well, and can deal with humans
well. Also, seeing as I am adopted into the clan, and not part of
