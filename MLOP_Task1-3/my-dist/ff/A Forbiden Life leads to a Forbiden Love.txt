I don't think you understand. I mean this REALLY isn't good…</B></p><P>Naruto's
world began to fade in and out. Darkness began to overtake him,
dimming the stars slowly. The Kyuubi's voice began to fade, the
usual powerful voice shrinking until it was just a whisper, and then
it just stopped. "Sorry Naruto, I just couldn't have you
interfering, my plans will carry on uninterrupted." Orochimaru's
voice drowned out everything else around him, the sound of the night,
and the screams of his teammates never seemed to reach his ears. The
shape of Orochimaru's laughing silhouette was the last thing he
could see, even though the world was black, Orochimaru seemed to be
darker. Before his world went blank, the beating of Naruto's heart
seemed to be a thousand times louder than it had ever been before,
thumping in Naruto's ears, it was the only thing he could hear.
Then darkness, nothing but darkness, no sound, no light, no nothing…</p><p align="center"><B>X
X X</B></p><P>"Naruto-kun…"
A soft voice pierces the darkness "… please wake up…" slowly
the world begins to come back to the young boy, the darkness fading,
the coppery taste of blood lingering in his mouth, "… please
don't leave me alone again… I don't want to be alone…" The
speaker's voice was cracked, it seemed to almost be in sobs, and
the person seemed to be on the verge of tears. "… Please come
back to me…" A soft hand cupped Naruto's left cheek, "… I
don't want another of my special people to die…" a few tears
falling onto his right shoulder, the wetness seeping into the fabric
of his t-shirt... or what was left of it, burying her face into his
chest, hugging him to her, mumbling "…Please… I can't be
alone anymore…" into his chest.</p><P>"Ugh…"
a soft moan escapes from Naruto's lips as he begins to stir, his
companion's body hampering his movement, his eyes slowly open
revealing the day, a bright light flooding his unprepared sense of
sight, the sun light was almost blinding, and in front of him there
was… was… a naked chick! Naruto's eyes flew open, as he jumped
backwards, or tried to jump backwards, he more or less just jerked
towards her then fell back into his original position. The pain in
his body was too much for him, making him incapable of movement. He
just mutters sorry over and over again, closing his eyes tightly
trying to not bleed to death from the river running out of his nose,
trying to give the girl as much dignity as he can give her. Blood
slowly trickles down from his nose, his face a deep red "I'm so
sorry, please don't hurt me". The young boy was used to being
punished for seeing girls in their birthday suits. The girl just
giggled softly.</p><P>"Naruto-kun,
open your eyes… I don't mind if you see me like this, in fact…
I want you to see me like this." she says shyly, lightly biting her
lower lip.<BR>"Huh?" Opening his left eye slowly too see if she
was telling the truth. Then slowly opening the other one, making sure
she wasn't going to hit him, he tried to look every where but at
her, trying to keep himself as composed as possible, but his eye's
seemed to just gravitate towards her.<I> God she's sexy, no wait,
mustn't think perverted thoughts…</I>, "H-h-how do you know
me?"</p><P>"You…
you don't remember?" a saddened girl responds, <I>Does he really
not know who I am… hasn't he noticed no talking in his
head?</I><BR>"Sorry… I… I… don't… and please put some
clothes on before I bleed to death!" a look of pain appears on her
face, something that makes Naruto feel a little guilty, even though
he didn't know what he had done wrong. <I>What did I do now? … I
hope she doesn't hit me…</I><BR>"Naruto-kun, I told you I want
you to see me like this." Slowly she picks up his right hand and
puts it on her right breast, slowly kneading it.<BR>"Naruto-kun…
I-I-I want to be yours… I need you…" She moans, her eyes were
filled with lust, a light blush on her skin. An awestruck Naruto, a
young boy who just didn't know what to do, paralyzed from pain and
from this amazing girl who just threw herself at him, a girl who he
just met. "ARG!" Naruto's face turns a bright red. His face
seems to explode in a giant gush of blood.</p><P>"F-f-fine
I'll just tell you what happened." She huffed, Naruto still
confused as to what he did wrong <I>why is she mad at me, what did I
do wrong?</I> Removing his hand from her breast and sitting beside
the boy. "Ok, let's begin…" Rain was pouring down from the
sky, Orochimaru was attacking you, Sakura, and Sasuke during the
second test of the chunnin exam…Sadly the exam is over, and you did
not pass, I'm sorry you had to find out this way… anyways… You
had just tapped into m… the power of the Kyuubi when…"</p><P><I>Flash
back</I></p><P>"<I>Ah,
so you are the demon vessel. Well we can't have you interrupting my
plans now can we? So, I guess I will have to remove you from the
picture, and hopefully anyone else who could cause me a problem in
the future." an annoyed Orochimaru said to the young boy. </I></p><P>"<I>Well
your plans won't matter in a second you bastard, because I'm
going to kill you!" a very angry Naruto yelled across to his
adversary.</I></p><P>"<I>Well,
that's no way to talk to a sannin now is it…? I will just have to
teach you some manners, and that you are powerless against me, and
powerless to stop me" Orochimaru rushed at Naruto, shredding the
boy's t-shirt and his orange jacket. With the speed even Kakashi
would have a hard time rivaling, Orochimaru kneed the young boy in
the stomach. POOF the boy was replaced by a log "This wont help
you boy, you will not interfere" Turing quickly Orochimaru threw a
kunai, it hit its mark. "AHHHHHHHHHHHH!" Sticking out of the
boy's leg was Orochimaru's projectile. Naruto gritted his teeth
"I will not loose" those words were almost a growl. Red chakra
flowed all over the boy and then, it was over. Orochimaru charged
Naruto, with the Kunai in his leg he couldn't move, two quick
movements with his thumbs and Orochimaru altered the seal on Naruto's
stomach, connecting the other seals on his stomach into one larger
seal. Suddenly the boy fell to the ground screaming in pain, his face
twisted into a mark of pain. The Uchiha and Sakura paralyzed in fear
from what they have seen, first their friend was covered in a red
shield of chakara, the boy they knew lost, then in a second he was
broken, in agonizing pain. Then in the blink of an eye, Orochimaru
said "</I>Sorry <I>Naruto, I just couldn't have you interfering,
my plans will carry on uninterrupted." Then with one swift kick
Naruto was sent deep into the thick forest.</I></p><P><I>The
screams of Naruto's teammates could be heard all over the forest,
many people thought he had been killed, many of the genins had small
funerals for their friend, but in reality the boy laid unconscious in
the middle of the forest. His shredded tops barely clinging to his
body, blood pooled at the edges of his lips from his mouth after
hitting the ground. The exposed seal on his stomach turning a bright
red, orangey red chakra seeping from the unconscious container's
body burning the ground under and around him. Slowly a bright red
ball forms over the seal. The ball began to grow, and grow, and then
slowly change shape into the silhouette of a person, into the shape
of a young female. </I></p><P><I>End
flash back</I></p><P>"S-so
y-your t-t-telling m-me t-that y-you'r-re…" Naruto tried
say,<BR>"Yes Naruto-kun I…" A blushing female tries to inform
an awestruck Naruto,<BR>"Y-you were that ball weren't you?" a
now intrigued Naruto asks.<BR>"Y-yes… well actually I came out of
you, I-I was let out of my cage…" an embarrassed woman
stuttered,<BR>"Y-y-y-you're th-th-the
K-K-K-Ku-Kyu-Kyuub-b-b-b-i!" a now extremely frighten and shocked
Naruto said, now trying to stay calm, scared that the Kyuubi might
get angry with him and destroy Kohona.<BR>"Naruto-kun, please don't
be scared of me… I… I…" Tears threatened to burst from her
eyes, she was no longer a fox, now she was a very beautiful redhead,
her long hair reaching down to her ass. Everything on her body seemed
to fit perfectly, everything proportionally sound except for her
breasts which seemed to be a little too big. "… Orochimaru wanted
to expel me from you so I could destroy the world… but well…
after so many years being inside of you, learning about you, knowing
everything about you…" Licking her index finger, then circling
the exposed nipple on a shaking Naruto "I just… couldn't
destroy you and everything you loved… so I… molded this new body
with my chakra for you… I… I… know you would like me like
this."</p><P>Slowly
she lowers her lips to his, planting a soft kiss on them.
"Na-Na-Naruto-kun… I-I-I have fallen in love with you… I've
known for a while… please don't reject me…" she softly moans
into his ear. <I>I-I-I shouldn't be enjoying this, she's the
Kyuubi… or she says she is, she's pure evil, and what about
Sakura, I love her! I can't forget about her!</I><BR>"WHOA, whoa
hold on a second… you're telling me you're the Kyuubi! Ya,
right, now you're telling me you love me, what the hell! If you
really are the Kyuubi, what was up with all the insults and shit you
put me through." Biting her lip lightly she just whispers<BR>"Well…
I-I-I couldn't let you know I liked you, I'm the Kyuubi, I'm
not supposed to fall in love, especially with a human, and how would
you have reacted if I would have told you?" <I>She does have a
point, I would have freaked out, and I really don't know what I
would have done…but she can't be the Kyuubi can she? Kyuubi!
Kyuubi! Where the fuck are you?</I></p><P><I><BR>Inside
Naruto's mind</I></p><P><I><BR>Wandering
around until he came face to face with the Kyuubi's cage, now
demolished and open, slowly Naruto walk's inside of the dark cage,
now illuminated. Inside he noticed was a large cage, nothing out of
the ordinary, concrete walls… but…but… but what's this? The
back wall was covered in scratch marks… "Mr. and Mrs. Uzumaki
Naruto" "Mrs. Uzumaki Naruto" "Mrs.Uzumaki Kyuubi" Naruto
was awestruck as he looked at his name in the middle of a perfectly
drawn heart… she… she…she was telling the truth but but but…I
can't believe this… Slowly he raised his hand to his cheek,
running his hand across his face. "M-m-my birthmarks are gone!"</I></p><P><I>End
of inside Naruto's mind</I></p><P>"..and
well I guess I'm just a little old fashioned… you know, being
mean to you but in reality really liking you… s-s-s-o-sorry, I
never wanted to hurt you, please believe me." The beautiful woman
slowly burst into tears, her tears falling onto her breasts.</p><P>Slowly
Naruto raises his hand to her face "Shhhh… don't cry, I can't
stand a crying woman, and I-I-I forgive you… if you are telling the
truth." " <I>I can't stand a crying woman, sorry Sakura, I just
can't stand it… it's worse than watching you drool all over
that Sasuke-bastard" </I>Doing the only thing that came natural,
he slowly pulled her into an embrace, her face lightening up
instantly, burying her face into his chest muttering Naruto I love
you over and over again. But, this blissful scene was soon cut short
by a team of ANBU. The members pried the Kyuubi from Naruto's body.
"Take her and lock her up, and take him to the hospital." The
leader of the ANBU team ordered his team, the screams of the Kyuubi
for Naruto pierces the silence of the early morning. Naruto's
screams to leave them the hell alone, just annoyed the hell out of
the ANBU members.</p><P>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>A/N:
end of chap 1, R&R and I'll continue this story. Sorry it is a
little short, but well it's the first chapter so well, they are
usually short, and no this will not just be a Kyuubi + Naruto love
fic, there will be action, and an actual story, and maybe just maybe
more couples.</p>

questions bounced around in Naruto's head as he lay on the hospital
bead, too tired to move, he'd been fighting to get out of his
imprisonment in the hospital for hours, but after being separated
from the Kyuubi he just didn't have the strength left. <I>Was the
Kyuubi really gone? </I>His throat was raw, he'd been yelling since
she was taken from him… <I>Did she really declare her love for me?
</I>He hadn't been separated from the Kyuubi in years, and now he
just felt weird being alone, totally alone. <I>Was… was… was I
really all alone? again…</I> But really… all he wanted to know
was if the Kyuubi was ok. He'd wished many times that it would just
die, just leave him alone, but now he really wasn't sure what to
think anymore. He knew how she felt, alone, no one to care for her,
no one to love her, and yet she loved someone else that hadn't
noticed her until recently.</p><P>Naruto
really didn't know what to think anymore. The people he thought
were his friends were restraining him and they were keeping him
against his will. Each of his "friends" had visited him, and each
one had tried to calm him down, they told him life would be better
for him now, that the Kyuubi was better off dead… but he wasn't
so sure, it had become a part of him by now, and he really longed to
be with her now.<I> How could they do this to me</I>?<I> I haven't
been apart from the Kyuubi for… well technically since I've been
born.</I> He thought they cared about him, but how can they keep him
against his will if they cared about him, how could they care about
him if they wanted to destroy, what was now, a part of him, as much a
part of him as his own soul. <I>Ugh, I can't think anymore, I
haven't had a good nights sleep in days. I… I… I think I'll
think of a way out of this after a few hours of sleep. </I>The
usually hyperactive nin passed into a restless slumber, totally
exhausted mentally and physically.</p><p align="center"><B>X
X X</B></p><P>A
few miles away the one that used to be part of him was being held
against her will in the cells below the Hokage's tower. The Kyuubi
had cried her self to sleep on the small mattress they had given her
in the tiny cell they had thrown her in. She just wanted to be with
Naruto, and now they were destroying her only chance at being with
the one she cared about. The cell she was in was tiny, only had a
toilet and a bed, not even a window to look out of, she didn't know
if it was night or day, she just knew that she wanted to be with
Naruto more than ever right now. Unguarded she lay in a special
chakra infused cell that made it impossible for her to touch the bars
of her cell, impossible for her to escape. Her body still unclothed,
her hands covered in chakra burns from trying to escape her prison,
pain was new to her, a new unwelcome sensation. Her long red hair was
her only cover from the cold draft in the damp cell block. This day
wouldn't come to an end for her, she slept plagued by a horrible
nightmare.</p><P><I>Kyuubi's
nightmare</I></p><P><I>The
young girl was weeping uncontrollably, her eyes red and puffy, her
face wet from the tears. The man she loved was standing on the other
side of her cell. "Hahahaha, you thought I could ever care about
you. Ha, I'm just so happy that I'm free of you, now I'm truly
happy, the villagers wont stare at me anymore, my friends will like
me more, and I will be more powerful without a nagging fox inside my
head!" the young man now horribly warped from the man she knew and
wanted was saying horrible thing, things that crushed her soul.
Slowly her cell door opens and Naruto slowly walks backwards, as she
runs after him, unable to catch up to the man she loves, she trips
over an unseen object falling into the neck slot on a guillotine. The
top snaps down, Naruto and his precious people pointing and laughing
down at her as the blade falls down to end her life finally… then…"</I></p><P>"AHHHHH!"
The dream had been so real the young nin' though, as he was aroused
from his restless slumber, covered in a cold sweat and still tied
down the nin realized that the horrible experience he just went
through was just a dream. <I>Ok it was just a dream, thank god, that
was too fucking real. </I>He had destroyed everything he held dear
while trying to save the Kyuubi that<I> was weird</I>... He had
killed them all,<I> But… I… could never hurt the people I care
about, my classmates, my teachers, my friends</I>; Sakura, Hinata,
Neji, the Hokage, Chouji, Shikamaru, Kiba and his little dog to,
Shino, Iruka, and Kakashi. He had killed them all, preying on their
hesitation to kill him he had destroyed them, then his real nightmare
was realized as Sasuke stood above him, laughing at Naruto, defeating
the number one hyperactive ninja in battle, the Uchiha driving a
kunai down towards Naruto's neck telling him he was weak, that he
was worthless, that he would never become Hokage ever... <I>and I
would never let HIM win, I would never loose to HIM, he will never
get the chance to do that to ME. </I>Then it was over, thankfully,
but it was so real, he could almost feel the blood of the people he
cared about on his hands, he could still feel it even after being
awake for a few minutes.</p><P><I>I…
I have to find a way out of this… I'll talk to the Hokage… as
soon as I get out of these restraints, heh, that shouldn't be too
hard. </I>Naruto now full of energy, really hungry, and really pissed
easily escapes from his bonds <I>why didn't I just do this last
night… oh yah… fighting with the ANBU for hours is really tiring</I>.
Jumping out the window Naruto makes his way to the Hokage's tower.
Ignoring the towns people who see him, ignoring the sweet smell of
ramen, he didn't even notice Sakura at the door of the hospital, he
was set on finding out what the fuck the Hokage was thinking, that
baka, he will pay.</p><P>It
only took a few minutes for the hyperactive nin on a war path to get
to the Hokage's tower. The doors that he walked through were blown
off their hinges, large dents were found in the adjacent walls.
"HOKAGE!" the young nin was full of anger, he had angered himself
with thoughts of the Hokage torturing the Kyuubi.<BR>"Naruto I was
expecting you, please sit down" the old man had ignored Naruto's
rudeness," You better not have hurt her!" If looks could kill,
then the look Naruto was giving the Hokage would have destroyed
Konoha.<BR>"Naruto, sit down and we can talk" the Hokage seemed
to be unfazed by Naruto's glare.<BR>"I will not sit down old man,
you will pay if she has been harmed! And you will tell me why you
took her away! And you will tell me what the fuck is going on!"
Naruto was about to burst, chakra was seeping out of Naruto, covering
him in a sort of blue flame." If you sit down, and calm down, I
will tell you… almost everything you want to know." Reluctantly
the young nin sat down, still glaring at the Hokage but the flames
had subsided.<BR>"She if fine for the moment, we took her because
she is a threat to us all, she must be destroyed. And what is going
on is Orochimaru stole the skin of one of the contestants in the
Chunnin exam, snuck in, tried to steal Sasuke and tried to unleash
the Kyuubi on us all… we still don't know why she didn't go and
kill us all, but it doesn't matter now. Soon enough we will be rid
of her forever, and then we will be able to live peacefully" The
Hokage took a deep sip of his drink.<BR>"I won't let you hurt
her!" Even though the Kyuubi was out of Naruto he still contained a
godly amount of chakra. Naruto's words had made the Hokage stop
drinking and look up at the boy. The boy had been consumed by rage,
now the Hokage was slightly scared that he would have to fight the
young boy, and by the looks of him, the Hokage knew he would lose, he
didn't want to hurt Naruto, and Naruto was just so
determined.<BR>"You… you… you don't know what it's like
being alone, you don't know what it's like not having anyone, you
don't know what it's like to be treated like a monster, I won't
let anyone else be treated like that. And I won't let anyone die
because of it." The young boy was now standing, chakra seemed to
flow freely from his body, and killer intent was being focused on the
Hokage more intensely than it has ever been focused on him before.
Naruto showed no signs of tiring even though he was wasting a lot of
chakra, the Hokage had no idea the boy had this much power. The
Hokage was scared for his own safety, the young nin' was covered in
a chakra flame that was begging to singe the floor of his office,
enraged, and towering over the old man, the old man was beginning to
become afraid he didn't know what the young man would do.</p><P>In
the blink of an eye Naruto had already crated a few shadow clones, 5
Naruto's were in a straight line as they used sexy no jutsu, 5 naked
Narukos (A/N: name that has been given to the female Naruto) stood in
front of the Hokage. The old man was blown away, literally, the blood
from his nose rocketed him across the room, into a wall. <I>Wow this
was easier than I thought it would be, luckily for me the old man is
a huge pervert! </I>Slowly, making sure to sway her hips the 5
Narukos walked over to the Hokage, her sexy movements keeping him
subdued. Leaning down the Hokage slowly closed his eyes and made as
if he was going to kiss her… unluckily for him Naruto had other
plans. Using the time the Hokage gave him, Naruto tied the Hokage up,
making sure that he wouldn't be able to use any nin-jutsus.
With an evil grin on his face Naruto turned two of his clones into
feathers, and made the other two tickle his feet. He liked the old
man somewhat so Naruto allowed the two clones to remain in Naruko
form. Quickly the real Naruto looked on the Hokage's desk, after
finding what he needed he ran from the Hokage's office, off to find
the Kyuubi.</p><P>The
real Naruto had explored this tower many times when he was younger.
He knew this tower most likely better than anyone else besides the
Hokage him self. He knew each corridor, where each door went, the
guard rotations. He knew everything that he wasn't supposed to. So
luckily, he knew where the Kyuubi would be held, grabbing the cell
key from the Hokage's office before he left, <I>Wow they should
really have different locks for each cell, not just one, would have
made breaking her out so much more difficult, but would keep Kohona
safer, but hey, lucky for me. </I>the young nin was off to save
someone who he, until recently, thought he cared nothing about.</p><p align="center"><B>X
X X</B></p><P>"AHHHHH!"
the naked Kyuubi bolted upright from her slumber. She brought a hand
to the back of her neck. <I>Oh, good my heads still here. </I>It had
been years since the Kyuubi had had dreams of her own. <I>Why would I
dream of something like this? He would never do anything like that…
right? </I>She scolded her self for thinking something like that; <I>of
course he wouldn't do something like that</I>. Slowly she turned to
look out at the bars of her cell, <I>I… I wish he was here, I miss
being with him… </I>all she could see was darkness. Tears began to
run down her face uncontrollably, her hands shot up to her face. "I…
I… I… I just wanted to be with Naruto…" sob "… but all I
did was get us both in trouble…" sob "… now I'm locked up
here, unable to help Naruto ever again…" sob "… why didn't
I just run when I had the chance, but… now what will Naruto's
life be like in the future, without me to protect him…?"</p><P>"No
one can tell the future, but I do know that if we don't get out of
here fast we wont have much of one." Looking up, tears blurred her
vision. <I>it couldn't be… could it? </I>Wiping away the tears
from her eyes, <I>it is, it is him! </I>The man she loved in his
orange jump suit stood out side the bars, right where he was in her
dream and he… he… he… was laughing… at her! <I>Oh no, my
dreams going to come true isn't it! </I>The door of the cell slowly
opened, <I>oh god please don't let this happen… </I>but instead
of running away the nin ran into the cell and picked up the naked
girl bridal style, she wrapped her arms around his neck so she
wouldn't fall out of her dream boy's grasp.<BR>"We better get
out of here fast before the guards come." Leaving no time to
protest Naruto was already running out of the tower he was in.
Knowing that his Shadow replications were already destroyed, and that
the ANBU would be after him soon he ran at full speed to try and get
out of Konoha.</p><P><I>What
am I doing? I'm leaving everything I know and love for… someone I
just met… well I didn't really just meet her but still, I just
met her as how she is really. But I have no time to think about that
now. I have to get out of here now. </I>Naruto pushed all his
thoughts away and just concentrated on running, and trying to leave
as little of a trail as possible. He knew it would only be a matter
of minutes before someone was onto him, chasing him, trying to bring
him back for punishment, and to kill the Kyuubi. <I>I will not let
them take her. I'll die before I let them have her. </I>He silently
vowed that she wouldn't come to harm as long as he was still
breathing.</p><P><I>I…
I'm in his arms! </I>The Kyuubi shifted her self slightly, resting
her head on his chest listening to his breathing, his heart beat. She
was in complete bliss. <I>He's been running, with me in his arms
for a while now and he isn't even tired, his breathing is still
calm and his heart beat is still slow… maybe he is stronger than I
thought… I'll have to apologize for that. </I>Yawn, the young
girl was feeling sleepy, she didn't get much rest even though she
slept for hours in her cell, and slowly she drifted off into a
peaceful sleep, feeling so comfortable and protected in his arms. <I>She
really is cute… maybe more so than Sakura… NO! I'm not supposed
to think about that! We are escaping, I'm not supposed to be
thinking about her like this, I'm supposed to be thinking about how
to keep her safe, not how to get her into my bed… which by how
she's been acting and talking wouldn't be that hard, NO! Shut up
Naruto and just concentrate on getting out of here. </I>But the young
boy couldn't help but think about the beautiful, naked woman in his
arms.</p><P>He
didn't know where they were going to go, and didn't know when
they were going to stop, but he did know that they only had each
other and that was it… and he also knew they both had to sacrifice
a lot for this… he had to live without ramen, he didn't know how
he was going to do it, but he was.</p><P>-

Final edit of this chapter, muahahaha my editor rocks even though
he's a bitch glares Anyways, he was being a dumb ass, and he's
guna make me explain stuff that he didn't understand till I told

part at the end of a chapter from now on (don't know if there will
be one in this chapter yet) at the end to get a better understanding
of my vision :P.)</p><P>-

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P>The
young woman in Naruto's arms shifts slightly, pushing herself
closer to the object of her affection. Her arms were around his neck,
he was holding her bridal style. She was staring up into his
beautiful blue eyes, he was staring forward trying not to look down
at the naked kitsune in his arms, but every once in a while she would
catch him looking down at her and it would cause her to blush. <I>At
least I know he likes to look at me. That's a start. </I>They were
flying through the air or it seemed like it to her. <I>Does he love
me? He did come and save me… but in doing so he gave up everything
he cared about, everything he has ever known… he gave up everything
for me. I won't make his sacrifice a useless one. I will make his
life as great as I can… it's the least I could do… </I>She
buries her face into his chest, inhaling his sent deeply, she didn't
care if he saw her doing this, she wanted him to know she that she
cared about him, not like the villagers, not like his "friends"
not like his "family", and she wanted him to know that she was
completely in love with him. Bounce, Naruto had landed on the ground
again then bounced back into the air.</p><P><I>Where
can we go? Oh god, did I do the right thing? Well by now the Hokage
has probably sent out many shinobi to bring us back to Kohona, but I
can't allow them to bring her back or all of this would have been
in vain, and I would lose something close to me forever. I can't
let that happen again. </I>The young boy was looking around for some
where to stop, somewhere to rest, he was getting tired, the day was
coming to an end, and he wanted to make sure that the Kyuubi was
alright. <I>I wish I could rest a little, I haven't stopped running
since this morning… that was hours ago! </I>Naruto's train of
thought was broken when the Kyuubi snuggled in closer to him. <I>Oh
god she's cute, I bet Kakashi would be jealous, wait, NO, god, I
need to stop thinking that way, I'm no pervert, I need to focus on
getting us away, that's it.</I></p><P>Naruto
was now trying desperately to find some where to rest, his mind was
becoming distracted. The Kyuubi was breaking his concentration way
too much. "Finally!" the word burst from his lips a little too
loudly, he didn't want to disturb the Kyuubi, she looked too
peaceful in his arms for him to want to do such a thing.<BR>"Huh?"
the girl that was pressed to his body asked inquisitively,<BR>"Oh…
I uh, found some where we can stop at…" The boy responded, a
little regretful for having removed her from her serene state. A
sigh of relief escaped from the girl's mouth, she wanted to spend
some quality time with Naruto. This small action calmed Naruto's
soul lightly. <I>Finally, I get to be alone with him, without any
disturbances.</I> Something she hadn't done since she'd been
released from inside Naruto. Soon after his small outburst, Naruto
deposited the Kyuubi into the hiding place he had found. It wasn't
the most beautiful place ever but it would have to do. Their resting
place was an almost uprooted tree, there was now a small cave where
the tree used to stand, it was quite small but it would have to
do.<BR>"I uh… will have to leave you here for a bit, I'd like
to set up some fake tracks and some traps for the people who are
following us." The boy said to the Kyuubi drearily. The Kyuubi just
pouted. <I>Oh god, she's cute… no I can't be thinking like
that, she's literally like a billion years old even though she
looks like she's my age, and plus I love Sakura… I think… she
did try and get me to forget about the Kyuubi… oh god… her puppy
eyes are so powerful... well that could be because she's
technically from the dog family but still… </I>The boy was deep in
thought as he left the beautiful naked girl by her self in the small
grotto.</p><P><I>Darn,
I was so close to some time alone with Naruto… now he has to go off
for god knows how long, leaving me all alone… I might as well try
and make this place as nice as I can for his return. </I>The Kyuubi
began to push out the loose soil and foliage that had gotten under
the tree. <I>At least I can make this a nice place to sleep… and
maybe big enough to fool around a little in, hehe. </I>When she was
done it had made the place a little bigger, but she was far from
finished. Going out side she began to rip up grass to make a soft mat
for the two occupants. She had barely finished cleaning up and
preparing her make shift house when she heard a familiar voice. She
froze up when she heard it, it wasn't Naruto-kun's. "This is so
troublesome…" Where had she heard that before, "... I'm not
going to find them tonight, and they have to rest too. Might as well
go and sleep in that tree over there…" Was he talking about this
tree? But… if he found her, then he would bring her back to Kohona
she couldn't let him do that. She just prayed that he wasn't
talking about this tree. But of course he was.</p><P>"AH!"
her shriek broke the silence of the forest. The sound was carried
throughout the forest. Luckily for her no other shinobi were around
to hear her. Unluckily for Shikamaru, Naruto was.<BR>"What the
hell?" <I>Did I just find a naked chick in a tree? Wait… she fits
the description of… is she… yes! She's the Kyuubi! Oh aren't
I lucky, Naruto isn't around and she doesn't look that strong…</I></p><P>-

Sorry really short chapter I know, but It just felt right to stop the
chapter here… I didn't want to make an extremely long chapter by
going into what the next chapter will be right here. (Sorry if that's
a little confusing) Oh, and finally the next chapter will get in some
fighting, blood, violence, and maybe I don't know yet some
lemoness… will show you why this fic deserves a M rating.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>Note: Not a Chapter,
just felt bad about chapter 3 being so short, so I thought I would
edit chapter's 1 and 2 early so you can read them again to see if
they are better… didn't add a lot more but some. Plus this gives
me more time to write chapter 4 for you guys so I hope I'll get it
up tomorrow, maybe Wednesday… Latest Thursday.</p><P>Oh and by the way
thanks for the reviews, and I will only put up chapter 4 if I get 1
more review on chapter 3. I want 3 reviews per chapter from now on,
not a lot to ask some people are asking for 25 reviews a chapter so
feel lucky, I just want to see what you people think of my story.</p>

K, I'll try and keep that in mind Just kind of hard to make
everything perfect without an editor, lol.</p><P>JohnnyG:
the Kyuubi only has a few feelings, it's kind of hard to stretch
them out… she isn't very complex… Happy, sad, scarred… she
isn't like depressed (she's with Naruto), she isn't
hysterically happy (they are being chased down by his "friends"),
she isn't terrified (she is the Kyuubi, she's lived a long life
and has seen many more terrifying things)</p><P>Kitsurumenokitsune:
There she got clothes, but remember this has been less than 48 hours
of time, they really haven't had a lot of time to get clothes
between being chased down and being captured.</p><P>E-HERO

hand was wrapped around the Kyuubi's wrist, she was struggling
furiously, and an extremely angry shinobi was rushing back to his
other half after just completing what he set out to do.</p><P>The
Kyuubi was struggling against her captor; his grip had tightened
substantially since he'd first grabbed her. "Please, just leave
us alone!" her struggling became more frantic as she tried to plea
with Shikamaru. "Why do you people always have to destroy what he
holds dear, just leave us alone, let him be happy!" Her voice was
beginning to change from distressed to aggravated, then WHAM
Shikamaru's other hand shot out, slapping the beautiful face of the
girl he just wanted to take back to Kohona quietly.</p><P>"…
just
be quiet…." the shinobi looking down at the pitiful sight before
him, she was slumped on the ground holding the red hand mark on her
face, tears were rolling down her cheeks, and the most annoying wail
was escaping from her mouth. "… how troublesome"</p><P>CHANGED!
Those two simple words met the ears of a very scared ninja.
<I>Shikamaru… but why… why would he do such a horrible thing?</I>
Naruto had arrived back at the tree to see the Kyuubi on the ground
crying, a hand shaped mark on her face, a bruise forming on her
wrist, and Shikamaru above her. <I>She's all I have left… why
aren't I allowed to have anything… why does everything get taken
away from me? </I>"He'll come for me… he won't let you take
me, he's going to kill you." She growled at Shikamaru, her eyes
beginning to glow a demonic red but quickly returned to normal only
phasing Shikamaru for a second, tears still clinging to her eye
lashes. <I>She wants me to save her… I won't let him take her
from me… I won't be alone again; I won't let her be alone
again…</I></p><P>Bolting
from the surrounding foliage Naruto was running towards the Kyuubi
and Shikamaru. "… eh? Oh… hey Naru-" Shikamaru never got to
finish his sentence, Naruto's fist had already collided with his
skull. With concern in his eyes, Naruto looks down at the Kyuubi and
asks "Are you ok?" she simply nodded, unable to say anything to
her savior. <I>He cares, he really cares! He came to save me, when I
was in need he was here! No one's ever been there for me… </I>"Hide,
I don't want you to get hurt, and if I die… run." The usually
cheery voice of the number one hyperactive ninja was now replaced by
something foreign, some thing dark, something the Kyuubi really
liked.</p><P>"Ugh…
what the fuck Naruto," Shikamaru was picking him self up from off
the ground.<BR>"I won't let you hurt her," Naruto's new voice
was void of any emotion besides hate, it was everything Naruto was
not. These six words seemed to stun Shikamaru, Naruto's new voice
scared the nin, his words shattered any illusion of Naruto coming
back to Kohona calmly. "… how troublesome…" Shikamaru had
watched the Kyuubi crawl into the forest behind Naruto, escaping from
his view, and from his grasp for now. Slowly he went into a fighting
stance.</p><P>Naruto
seemed to be void of everything he was known to be, his eyes were
dull instead of the vibrant blue they usually were. Shikamaru had
never seen Naruto like this, but <I>Naruto was at the bottom of the
class so he shouldn't be a problem anyways, at least I know that I
wasn't trying, he was, I was faking my uselessness, he wasn't. 
</I>This thought floated around inside Shikamaru's mind as he
stared at the now fuming Naruto. <I>I hope I get back to Kohona with
enough time to watch the clouds.</I></p><P>Then
it happened, Naruto caught Skikamaru off guard landing a powerful
punch in the shadow nin's stomach which sent him flying into the
tree that was a few yards behind him. The sound of Shikamaru smashing
into the tree echoed off the trees in the forest, it sounded like a
raw steak smashing into a plank of wood. The birds disturbed by the
sound fled quickly, and Shikamaru groaned. He'd been imbedded into
his landing place, a small crater in a once large, powerful tree, its
splinters at Shikamaru's feet, some stuck in his flesh.</p><P><I>How
could such a… loser be so powerful? One punch and I'm already in
a tree… literally, how troublesome, he isn't that smart…
maybe…</I>Quickly the fox boy began to jump towards Shikamaru
closing the distance between the two fighters quickly. Naruto's arm
was wound back, he started to bring it forward then… just stopped
"WHAT THE HELL! WHY CAN'T I MOVE!" A frantic Naruto screamed,
then it donned on him. <I>Damn that Shikamaru… well at least he's
closer to a hard surface than me, and he can't move without me
moving also. </I>Shikamaru's shadow had attached it's self to
Naruto during his earlier charge. "How troublesome…" <I>How
will I get out of this, think Shikamaru, think… there has to be a
way, there is no way I will be beaten by… by… by a dead last…
at least I didn't try… he, he… tried his best and still failed…
why am I loosing so badly? </I></p><P>Shikamaru
played out many different scenarios in his mind with his new found
data on Naruto, trying to find the best way to defeat the number one
hyper active nin, and he just couldn't find a way to win. <I>I'm
closer to a hard surface so I can't do that, plus Naruto has an
unnaturally hard skull, He faster and stronger than me, so he will
win in an all out brawl. Whoever in the world anyone thought I could
defeat Naruto by my self is a complete moron, I'm more of a support
nin, or a thinker… this fighting thing is just too troublesome…
</I>Shikamaru's chakara was slowly depleting, he didn't have much
time left holding Naruto in one place. <I>There's only one chance,
I just have to try…</I> Releasing Naruto from his grasp, Shikamaru
did the only thing he could, duck down. Naruto's fist came crashing
down, glancing off Shikamaru's right side then into the tree
totally obliterating it, and crushing a few of Shikamaru's ribs.
<I>He… he… has that much power… he crushed my bone in one hit!</I></p><P>Dashing
to the left, pulling out a kunai and throwing it at Naruto, he won
him self a small slash on Naruto's right side. A small spurt of
blood erupted from the cut, but quickly slowed as the blood began to
clot. Shikamaru knew that he was just drawing out the inevitable, he
played through 200 scenarios and each one he came up with a loss…
Then it happened, he wasn't paying attention to where he was going,
just trying to see where Naruto was. BAM! He was caught off guard by
one of Naruto's clones, it's fist smashing into Shikamaru's
nose, blood splattering all over Naruto's fist, the cartilage was
totally destroyed. <I>How, how did he get all the way over here? And
besides that, my nose will never be the same if it ever gets fixed…</I>
Then he saw it, two Naruto's, one fighting him and the other
rushing, <I>What the hell? </I>One quick swipe with the Kunai and
Naruto's clone was destroyed. <I>A clone? But how did it attack me?
</I>Then almost as quickly as it started it was over. <I>Awwww hell…
</I></p><P>"AHHHHH!"
The scream of a shadow nin swept over the forest, Naruto's kunai
imbedded into his left shoulder. Naruto stepped over and onto the
Kunai in Shikamaru's shoulder, the tip almost all the way through,
Shikamaru's skin was going up in a point on the other side of his
wound. "AHHH! OH GOD!" The pain was too much for Shikamaru, the
kunai being driven deeper and deeper into his flesh, slowly splitting
what resistance his shoulder had, "I told the old man that I
wouldn't let you hurt her, I told him I wouldn't let you take
her, but does anyone ever listen to me, no, no one ever listens to
Naruto. Now look what it's gotten you into," Naruto's voice was
cold, uncaring, depressed, evil… just not Naruto. Shikamaru's
blood gushed onto Naruto's foot, and slowly onto the ground, the
kunai finally through, "I told him, I told that old man to leave us
alone, I told him not to try and take her… I told him to not try
and make either of us alone… But does anyone ever listen to me? No,
no they don't and now look at where it's gotten you, battered,
beaten, and bloody. Now I can't have you giving much information to
anyone else... and I can't have you following us now can I, so you
leave me with one choice…"</p><P>Slowly
the Kyuubi moved out of her hiding place and moved towards Naruto.
"Naruto-kun, are you…" She was quickly cut off by the
hyperactive ninja "Kyuubi, stay back I don't want you to see
this." She would do anything for him, so she sat down cross legged
where she was recently standing waiting for his return, for the man
she loved to return, for the man who saved her life to return, for
the man she wishes to thank to return, for Naruto to just come back
to be with her.</p><P>Slowly
dragging Shikamaru into the thick of the forest leaving a thin trail
of blood, Naruto disappearing from the Kyuubi's vision once again…
something she never liked… something she never wished to happen
again but it was inevitable.</p><P>-
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P><I>God
damnit, why did Naruto have to run away with, with… the Kyuubi of
all things, like what was that boy thinking? </I>Slowly jumping
through the forest the long haired blond from Shikamaru's team
searched for her targets. <I>Why couldn't he have just been normal,
and left her to die, then I wouldn't be in this forest getting my
hair dirty… He's going to pay for that. </I>Then she heard it…
well everyone in the forest heard it "AHHHHH! OH GOD!"
<I>Shi-Shikamaru? </I>She began to pick up more speed as she ran
towards the scream.</p><P>She
was quickly jumping towards the sound she heard, when she saw
something flash in the sun light, something was reflecting light. She
had to see what it was, could be a kunai cutting Shikamaru. She
quickly made her way towards the shiny thing, but what she saw wasn't
what she expected. The shiny thing was Shikamaru's blood, which
covered most of his body: he was tied to a big tree in the middle of
a clearing, a kunai was buried to the handle in his shoulder, his
blood was everywhere. Cuts, gashes, slices were all over his body and
his arms and legs were bent at horrible angles. <I>Oh god Shikamaru,
how could anyone do this too you, how could anyone have killed you.
</I>Then she saw it, Shikamaru's head lifted, his eyes locked onto
hers, his mouth formed a smile, blood crusted on the edges.
"I-I-In-n-n-o… ugh…" Then his eyes rolled into the back of
his head, only the whites of his eyes were showing, then his head
dropped. "SHIKAMARU!" Her screech was heard by everyone, all the
shinobi in the forest, Naruto, the Kyuubi, even the Hokage of Kohona.
"Damn that girl has a loud voice, now what was she yelling", the
still struggling Hokage, which forgot to get someone to untie him
before sending everyone out to get Naruto muttered.</p><P>Ino
ran towards her fallen comrade, one of her precious people, but in
her rush she didn't notice the many trip wires she broke, then it
happened. THUD THUD THUD… As the other Shinobi approached the grove
they saw a somewhat beautiful and yet disgusting thing, a single tree
in the middle of a grove bathed in sunlight where darkness over ran
everything else, one man tied to the tree mutilated, and a woman with
multiple shurken sticking out of her back. He was holding her hand;
she was holding his, in a last sign of first and last love.</p><P>-

Sorry it took me so long, a month after when I promised… got a
little tied up with other things. Sorry not very good, but I was
blocked, I wrote the starting like 4 weeks ago, and had the idea for
the ending for so long… but the middle just… wasn't good… so
well I kind of rushed through it, trust me the other 6 chapters will
be much better (this fic will end on chapter 10) So well 40 complete
I guess… much more writing to do… much more story, hoping to
complete a chapter or two tomorrow… I will not keep you waiting
this long…</p><P>Changed:

returned to a confused Kyuubi still standing in the small clearing
she was in previously. Handing her Shikamaru's mesh shirt and
kakis, which he stole from the young boy since he wouldn't need
them anymore. Quickly the Kyuubi put on her new clothes. The kakis
hung very low on her hips, so low that the kakis were more pants on
the girl, and the waist was barley high enough to cover up her small
patch of fur, and the mesh shirt didn't cover up her nipples
properly, also it was too tight around her bust, the flesh of her
breasts were raised where there was no cloth, and depressed where
there was, giving her somewhat of an S&M look. The Kyuubi no
longer was exposed for everyone to see and it was a lot warmer than
what she was wearing before.</p><P>As soon as she
was fully dressed she soon found her self once again leaning her head
against his chest being carried bridal style, again, she was again in
perfect bliss. She soon found her self almost asleep in his arms, the
warmth of his body, the rhythmic beating of his heart, it was all so
comfortable. He soon began to run as fast as he could in the
direction the two were previously going before being rudely
interrupted. The young girl was amazed that Naruto still had some
stamina left, well actually he had a lot of stamina left, he was
young, inexperienced; and yet he still had enough strength to carry
her, even after running for 24 hours, being in a fight, and being
cut; he truly was amazing and she loved him for it. She would never
leave him, not like everyone else in his life, she was loyal to him
and would be no matter what happens.</p><P>It didn't
take a lot of time for the duo to arrive at another suitable camp
site. It wasn't as cozy as the last place, or as sheltered from the
elements, but it would do. As soon as the two had arrived, they
realized they hadn't eaten for over a day, and they both were very
hungry. Naruto quickly went back into the forest on a quest to gather
some food, leaving the Kyuubi alone to her thoughts. <I>So the only
good I did Naruto while I was inside him was regeneration, other than
that I was just a burden… well I really didn't help him much but
I was kind of pissed, being sealed inside of someone sucks. I never
meant to hurt him, now look he's sacrificing everything for me, the
one who killed his family and got him hated…I really need to find a
way to say thank you…</I>Lost in thought the Kyuubi never noticed
Naruto return, dead rabbit in hand.</p><P>"Yo!"
Naruto's cheery exterior had soon returned after the battle and the
disposing of Shikamaru's body. Naruto's eyes once again returning
to their bright blue color and a large smile was once again plastered
on his face. Most people saw his happy exterior and thought he was
happy, but the Kyuubi could see the sadness in his eyes, and she
hated it. The Kyuubi was startled by Naruto's loud voice,
disturbing the peacefulness of the night. She jumped into the air
letting a small yelp escape her lips."… sorry…" Naruto
genuinely felt sorry, "… I never meant to startle you."</p><P>"It's ok
Naruto-kun" the –kun suffix had been added at the end of his
name, and Naruto noticed it. The boy blushes lightly and turns away
trying to hide his embarrassment, returning to his previous activity
of cutting up the rabbit; their dinner, trying his hardest to not
think about the Kyuubi in any perverted ways, he was failing
miserably. <I>Those clothes are soooo hot! She is as sexy as Sakura!
I mean look at how the mesh makes her look like her breasts are bound
with thick rope and her pants are so low I can almost see her patch
of fur… NO, BAD NARUTO! You love Sakura not the Kyuubi, she's not
even human for god sakes!</I></p><P>Their supper
time was quiet, unnatural for the young boy. He sat there eating his
share of the rabbit, which was weird in its own right, he wasn't
complaining about only getting half a rabbit; he also ate in complete
silence. But he had killed for the first time today; he was still in
shock… <I>I-I'm a murderer… I k-k-killed so many things today
and for what, a demon fox? Who is really quite cute… no, that's
off topic… although staying off topic is probly a real good thing
right now…But I still killed Shikamaru, and Ino… and a rabbit,
I'm horrible… </I>Tears formed in Naruto's eyes, but not
wanting the Kyuubi see him cry, he didn't let them fall. <I>I don't
want her to see me weak, she can't, I can't let anyone see me as
weak! </I>Slowly the Kyuubi crawled up to him and wrapped her arms
around him, in a comforting embrace. Quickly he shrugged her off, he
knew he hurt her, but he didn't want to be comforted, he wanted to
be strong enough to not need to</p><P>As darkness
fell, the camp became exponentially colder, the Kyuubi trying not to
shiver, she didn't want to bother Naruto anymore, and he'd
already done so much for her, given up so much. She was thinking of
the boy that rescued her, saved her, was right now alone with her, a
gigantic smile plastered over her face. Shivering uncontrollably, her
teeth lightly chattering, she never noticed Naruto draping his jacket
over her. <I>It smells like him, Mmmmm… </I>She pulled it tighter
around herself. N<I>o! I can't take this, he'll be cold now, I
really shouldn't take anything more from him… </I>Slowly she
began to remove the jacket, <I>I need to give it back. </I>But by now
it was too late, Naruto was already snoring peacefully. <I>Well I
guess he doesn't need it… thank you Naruto. </I>Pulling it tight
around herself, she began to try and pretend that he was lying beside
her, she wasn't doing too well.</p><P>It was hard for
the Kyuubi to get to sleep that night. She was alone for the first
time in many years. She had been always tucked in Naruto's mind,
relatively comfortable and totally safe. She wasn't a shinobi, she
wasn't used to sleeping on the ground, especially not in the soft
fleshy body of a human, and out in the open she definitely wasn't
safe even though she did realize that with Naruto only a few feet
away she was as safe as she could be… all most... Tossing and
turning she just couldn't get comfortable, she was cold and lonely.
Flopping around, trying not to make any noise, she didn't want to
wake up Naruto. (Even though most likely you could run him over with
a truck and he wouldn't wake up.) <I>There, I did it, I'm
comfortable… god I hope I didn't waist too much of my sleeping
time. </I></p><P>Laying down
facing <B><I>her</I></B> Naruto-kun, her breathing began to slow as
she was just about to fall asleep, then she heard it. A faint quiet
whimper, <I>did that come from Naruto-kun? </I>She heard it a second
time, this time it piqued her curiosity too much to be ignored.
<I>Damnit, there goes the rest of my sleep time. </I>Slowly she
crawled towards the young boy, trying to be quiet and sneaky. <I>There
it was again. </I>She slowly got closer and closer to him, and each
time she heard the little whimper it got louder and louder, but also
the closer she got she noticed more and more things about him, he was
curled up in the fetal position shaking, no, shivering, his teeth
were chattering. <I>Is it even possible to shiver in your sleep… I
guess you learn something new everyday. </I>"Naruto-kun you
shouldn't have given me your jacket," whispering so quietly that
she barely heard it herself.</p><P>Lightly biting
her lower lip, the Kyuubi was lost deep in thought deciding what to
do. <I>What should I do? Naruto-kun is cold, but if I give him back
his jacket I'll be cold… but does it really matter if I don't
get any sleep? He's the one who did all the fighting, but then I
might get grumpy and say something I don't mean to Naruto… and
what about his little whimpering problem, there is no way I can get
to sleep with him doing that… I wish I could stop what ever is
making him do that; he doesn't deserve to be sad, scared, hurt,
even in his dreams…Oh god this is my fault… I- I –I need to
figure out a way to fix this…</I></p><P>She soon came
to the only natural decision, slowly and carefully she laid down
behind Naruto, draping one arm over his body, the other she used as a
pillow. Lifting her head up a little she began whispering comforting
things into his ear, "Shhh Naruto-kun, it's ok, I'm here, I
won't let anything happen to you, shhhh, it'll be all ok."
Unconsciously, Naruto entwined his fingers with the Kyuubi's in his
sleep as he relaxed, his body moving out of the fetal position and
into more of a line guided by the Kyuubi's own body. His soft
whimpering ceased, and as their body heat's mingled both their
shivering stopped. They each found peace sleeping with each other,
one found love he never knew he could have, the other just found a
place where she was needed, a place where she could help instead of
destroy.</p><P>-

seems to be the end of Chapter 5. Sorry it is a little short, and a
lot fluffy. I was thinking of putting a lemon here but decided
against it, thinking that we needed some more character development
instead of just rushing into some sex :P. Sorry I didn't get to far
in this like I hoped I would note to self stop trying to make
promises So I guess… I'll finish chapter 6 when I do… and the
last 5 chapters should go much faster than the first 5 considering I
already pretty much know what I'm guna write in them :P.</p><P>Anyways was
wondering what you people would like after this fix is done…</p><P>Naruto/Ino (I
just like this paring… dunno why…)</p><P>Naruto/Tsunade
(I like weird parings, dunno why… and this one is the weirdest of
weird, old lady who looks young + young boy :P)</p><P>Self insertion
fic (humorous somewhat… more of me using Naruto to vent my feelings</p><P>(anyways, you
could vote I guess if you wanted to, would like too see what you guys
would want… also suggestions would be nice too :P (just letting you
know I most likely wont do any normal parings, or anything to do with
Sasuke (I really hate him… I do… but I don't do the bashing
thing…)</p>

"Hey" "let's fuck" "sure"… life would be so less
complicated, and less expensive :P</p><P>madnarutofan:
One day, when I get around to write one, it will be added to this fic
:P.</p><P>granite69: I'm
also male, yes killing and death is good, dunno why I like the fluff
but I do… will be 10 chapters (not including notices of course).</p><P>Calidore: Would
be new, would be interesting, and would be hectic… I'm too lazy,
lol.</p><P>Skuld's Sentaro
5: Wouldn't you be weak if you just used lots of chakara to turn
your self into something else? I know if I changed my body I would be
tired and useless for a long time :p. And… what's wrong with S&M?
Most likely Naruto would but… I chose to give him some immunity,
because that would be a massive disadvantage in a fight, and I don't
want that :p.</p><P>dee-unlm1t3d: I
think I have a good Naruto/Ino story idea, but since everyone wants
Naruto/Tsunade I will be forced to use a story line I wanted to save
for a bit, but w/e… oh and I've wanted a Naruto/Tsunade story for
so long… I mean come on, she looks 20, they are close… when you
get Naruto/everyone but Tsunade including Shizune, and his ero-senin
(who is just as old)… I just don't get it…</p><P>-

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P>Getting up
after waking up next to something warm, soft. Something that gives
off the feeling that you will always be safe, is always the hardest.
Harder than getting up from a hot bed when the room is cold, harder
than getting out of a bed with silk sheets, it is truly a test of
will. Waking up next to something like that after you went to bed
without it is even harder, it's a present that wasn't given to
you for a holiday, it was just because. Naruto lay cuddled up next to
the Kyuubi, almost awake, his body almost unresponsive for a while,
until his brain kicked in. <I>I fell asleep on the ground… alone…
and what is warm and soft in the middle of a forest?</I> Slowly he
turned, trying not to disturb what ever was cuddled into his back
just incase it was a wild animal, he wouldn't want to disturb a
bear. Slowly he turned till he was facing the Kyuubi. <I>She's cute
when she sleeps, she looks so peaceful, her hair draped over her self
like a make shift blanket, her breasts almost exposed… She… she
slept with me! AHHH! A…an almost naked girl was pressed up
against my back all night. </I>Slowly blood trickled down from
Naruto's nose.</p><P>Lightly he
begins to shake the Kyuubi awake, "We have to get up, Kyuubi we
have to get up, come on, and we have to keep going." His voice was
low, a little more than a whisper. "5 more minutes mommy." The
end of her almost incoherent sentence even more muffled by Naruto's
chest as she snuggles in much closer than she was before. Lightly, as
she shifts her position, her leg rubs up against Naruto's crotch.
"BAW!" Naruto's nose erupts in a bloody explosion, that small
amount of stimulation pushed his thoughts into an area of extreme
perversion. He jumped back quite a bit as a small amount of blood
spatter onto the Kyuubi's face (A/N: ewwww, I know… just showing
their proximity…), this sudden motion wakes the Kyuubi. "AHHH!
Naruto! Are you ok, are we under attack, AH!" The Kyuubi's eyes
were wide, her voice full of fear. "AH! Naruto what happened to
your face!"</p><P>"Calm down…"</p><P>"But… what
hit you in the face? Was it me? Your nose, it's so…" Her face
changed from scarred to concerned.</p><P>"Uhhhh…
actually… I wasn't hit in the face I uh…" His face tuned a
bright red as he spoke.</p><P>"… Oh!
Naruto-kun, you were thinking about me." Her voice was husky, her
eyes telling him she wanted him, slowly on all fours she crawled
towards him.</p><P>"BWAH!"
Falling backwards as twin streams of blood shoot out of his nose, the
extreme blood loss making him pass out. (A/N: Ok I know a little OC,
but well… he's maturing fast because of what's happening, plus
well… any guy who had a hot, sexy girl clinging to their back all
night, then having them touch you like she did (even if its
involuntary) would generate the same reaction… plus he's like 13
or 14 so well… he's at that age.)<BR>"Naruto-kun, are you ok?
Naruto-kun?" Crawling towards the twitching Naruto she realizes
he's out cold. Pouting the Kyuubi tells the unconscious boy that
he'll never get to be with her if you can't handle that small
amount of sexuality. (A/N: couple thousand years learning about
humans and how they act, without a lover can make you a little
frisky, lol)</p><P>Knowing that
Naruto, without her quick regeneration ability to restore the blood
that he lost, would be out for a while, she decided that after her
little scene, which she found quite funny, she should gather some
breakfast. <I>It is the least I can do, I did almost kill him, even
though he deserved it, he did bleed all over me. </I>"Humph" her
demeanor changed from happy to somewhat annoyed. <I>But if he was
bleeding like that at least I know he was thinking of me like that,
that's better than a few day's ago when he was scared shitless of
me. </I>Once again a smile was plastered on her face.</p><P>Ruffle,
Ruffle</p><P>"God damn
Naruto, running away, making me go get him. Damn Hokage, making me
come all the way out here searching for that useless shinobi when I
could be with Sasuke, a real shinobi. Damn Forest, being all dense
like, making it so hard to get around. ARG!" The frustrated cries
coming from a pink haired kunoichi were heard by the Kyuubi who was
now scowling since she was woken from a daydream about her
Naruto-<B><I>kun. </I></B>By someone who was saying mean things about
him, about the strongest shinobi she knew, about her <B><I>true</I></B>
love. <I>She will pay for those words. I'm going to kill her, at
least then I will have no more competition for his heart, luckily for
me I stole one of Naruto's kunai… I hope he doesn't miss it,
and if he gets mad at me… well how else was I supposed to get some
breakfast? Kill something with my bare hands… hmm that doesn't
sound to bad right about now. </I>A sadistic smile replaced the
Kyuubi's angry look (A/N: yes I know her emotions are changing a
lot right now… so what, she's emotional. It's not like demons
aren't aloud to have emotions)<p></p><P>"Damn tree in
my way, why do I need to move, it should move, RAA!" Sakura
attacked the offending tree with all her might, the tree shuddered,
barely, and a few leaves fell from it's branches, but not even a
dent was put in the sturdy trunk. "God I'm weak… but at least
I'm better than Naruto, wouldn't it be embarrassing to be worse
than him, hahahaha. Worse than a dead-last, a… a… I don't know,
black whole of ninja knowledge!" Although she didn't know it, her
insults were being heard by someone who really, really didn't
appreciate them.</p><P>"AHH-mmmffftttt!"
A Kunai at her throat and a clawed hand over her mouth, Sakura's
scream was muffled before it could alert anyone else. "You
shouldn't say such thing's about Naruto-kun." The girl holding
Sakura captive growled. Red chakara was surrounding the two girls
burning the ground and lightly singing Sakura's skin, the Kyuubi's
eyes were red and slitted, her hands were clawed and Naruto's
trademark birthmarks were on her cheeks. The killing intent that was
being projected by the fox demon to Sakura was too intense for the
kunoichi, her knees buckled and tears began to run down from the
girls' eyes. "I thought kunoichi weren't supposed to show their
emotions, it could get them killed." As the Kyuubi growled the last
word she cut Sakura's neck, not enough to kill her but enough to
spill blood. Eye's wide with fear, unable to struggle… sniff
sniff "Awwww, did the poor weak kunoichi wet her self, did she
get too scarred?" The smell of urine filled the air, the liquid
soaking her shorts and seeping through the front of her dress (I
guess it's a dress, don't know what it is, a shirt/dress I don't
know…) "You better pray you don't get any of that on my pant…
errr… Shikamaru's pants"</p><P>"I don't
know what possessed you to say such thinks about Naruto-kun but it
was unwise. He IS stronger than you, he IS stronger than you will
ever be, he HAS already killed Shikamaru and your best friend, what's
her name, yes, Ino, that's it." If it was possible Sakura's
eyes seemed to get bigger and more terrified "Wasn't she near the
top of the class? I still don't know how you didn't hear her
scream, everyone heard it, the scream of a woman being pierced by
multiple kunai as she runs towards the man she loved, the man who was
dead and tied to a tree." Sakura was beginning to realize that no
one would save her, Sasuke was no where near, and Naruto was on the
other side, she was alone, over powered and she was going to die.
"Naruto-kun has saved your life countless amounts of times and you
ignored him, you ignored his love, and now you say he is a dead last,
he is useless, you are nothing, and you are less than nothing. You
were so infatuated with a genius who didn't care about you, you
couldn't see a man who would give you anything, do anything for
you, die for you if you asked, and now you will die for him, you will
no longer plague him." The crimson blood of a leaf shinobi sprayed
across the few trees that were surrounding the two women. Retribution
for the undeserved punishment that Naruto… and a tree took.</p><P>Slowly the red
chakara aura recessed, the Kyuubi's hands returned to normal, the
whisker marks disappeared, her canines shrunk back to normal size,
and her eye's returned to normal. Slowly she licked off the block
that was on her <I>Bitter, I should have known that</I>. "You're
welcome Naruto-kun, you will no longer be plagued by her." Spitting
on Sakura's body the Kyuubi continues on her hunt for some food.
Sure she would have liked to eat Sakura (A/N: remember she's a
demon) but she knew that Naruto would never go for such a thing,
especially since he used to like her.</p><P>Waking up after
what seemed like minutes but was most likely hours by where the sun
was now compared to where it was before, alone in a camp. <I>Has she
been taken? Why wasn't I? Why didn't I hear anything? Why wasn't
I killed? What's going on? </I>Soon Naruto's fears were at
peace as the Kyuubi returned, kunai in one hand two dead quails in
the other. Jumping up and rushing over to the demon fox, wrapping his
arms around her, "I-I thought I was alone again, I thought someone
took you, or that you left me… that, that you abandoned me too…",
his voice was cracking, the Kyuubi could tell he was fighting back
tears (A/N: Just telling you how messed up Naruto is mentally)</p><P>SLAP</p><P>Her hand came
into contact with his right cheek, kunai sticking out of the ground
where she dropped it, the two quails making two low thuds as they hit
the ground. "HOW COULD YOU THINK I'D LEAVE YOU?" Her eye's
flashed the demon's slited eyes.</p><P>"… I… I…
I just thought… my parents left me, my guardians left me, my
village left me, my teachers left me, my friends left me… I just
thought that well… you'd leave me too like everyone else…"
his voice was low; tears had just broken though his defenses. Letting
go of the Kyuubi and turning, he didn't want to let her see him
weak. Slowly she wrapped her arms around him, his back to her, "Shhh,
it's ok, I forgive you, I just thought that… Naruto-kun, I'll
never leave you, I love you… don't you understand." Raising her
self up on her tippy-toes she began to lightly kiss Naruto's neck.
(A/N: Only sensual thing I could think of, sorry)</p><P>With a quick
movement Naruto pushed the Kyuubi off of him with his right arm,
hitting the ground hard. "Naruto-kun?" The confused girl asked
him what that was for with a single word, slowly the boy turns to
her.<BR>"Get up now." The order said quietly but
forcefully<BR>"NARUTO-KUN!" Out of his right shoulder a Kunai
meant for her was imbedded in him.<BR>"Mass shadow replication!"
a wall of clones appear in front of Naruto and the Kyuubi. "I said
get up." Quickly the Kyuubi raises her self from the ground,
hundreds of clones were being destroyed by rains of Shurken and kunai
every second. "Quickly, run, hide, let me take care of her, there
is only one kunoichi in the trees, go!" His voice was urgent, his
eyes told her he cared, that he wanted to protect her. Quickly
running into the forest, using the clones as cover, hiding far enough
away that she wouldn't be detected but she could see the fight.</p><P>"Why can't
you just leave us alone, why can't you just let us be? Why do you
have to bother us?"</p><P>-

updating fast eh, will get even faster now since well this is almost
over, was going to put a second fight in this fic, but decided to
combine two shorter chapters and shorten this one so all the chapter
will be relatively the same size instead of a 5000word chapter and
two 1600 word chapter, 2500 word chapters (or close to) work just as
fine.</p><P>By the way I
just updated every single chapter, so well… I'd recomened reading
them, added a little bit more content, clarified some things, fixed
some spelling mistakes, and added some more detail. If you don't
want to reread everything, at least reread chapter 2 added like 500 –
700 more words (something like that I forget) so a lot more…</p><P>And I finaly
decided to fix Kyuubi's name, lol, took me 6 chapters but I did it
:P.</p><P>P.S: can
someone tell me how much smut I can get away with in a lemon? I would
like to push it to the max but I want to keep it within the rules,
remember this is rated M… so well… I need to be informed so I can
start writing :P.</p>

(IMPORTANT):</p><P>Sorry random notice
here, but anyways, I have some sad news…</p><P>I have been having
trouble sleeping (last 5 days, ugh) (1 or 2 hours of sleep a night I
am currently only able to do anything because I have a case of coke
(the drink) beside me (sad eh)) and well, I can't write with no
sleep… so well I can't write the next chapter till I get some
sleep… sorry everyone I wanted to finish this before my school year
started but sadly I guess that won't happen.
I am quite angry right now.</p><P>I'm very irritable
right now, am seeing things, and very tired, and I just generally
feel like shit. Hope I get better soon so I can please my adoring

know how much sex and junk I can put into an M rated fic… I don't
want to get into trouble and well… I can get very descriptive (A/N:
Took me 4 tries to spell that word…) when describing things that
interest me, lol.</p><P>2. I would like to know
how descriptive you people would want a lemon scene, cause well you
people are the one reading it, I want to please you so well… you
want it really vague (250-500 words), somewhat descriptive a medium
length (like 1000 words I guess), or you want all the details, each
bead of sweat, each moan, each groan, each caress, full fic, no real
story just raw sex?</p><P>3. I would like to
inform you that after the ending of this fic I will post some things
that went through my head… I.E: Why I wrote certain scenes, what
different ideas went through my head (some were quite radical, and
would have changed the story completely), why I did certain things
(why I wrote a death scene like that, why I chose that character to
die, why I chose to pick this specific time, ect.)</p><P>4. With the
Naruto/Tsunade fic tell me if you want a one shot (easy, and have a
great idea on how to write it) or a true fic that I have no idea how
to write grins innocently</p><P>-

have learned to forget him, his teammates have moved on. Alone and
rejected he turns to the only person who still felt the same about
him, who kept her love for him for all the time he was gone.(A/N: I
know corny eh :P, but couldn't think of anything)</p><P>(One shot) She never
knew how much she felt for him until he didn't come back. Everyone
thought he was lost, he even let the kyuubi out of its cage under
oath (which everyone knows that greater demons can't break) that he
would keep everyone he loved safe. Years later he returns. One
thought on his mind he has too see her, she was all that kept him
alive, she has too know how he felt.</p><P>-

sleep... was so horrible… but now I'm back, will finish the fic
very soon :p the next few chapters will be very good If they get
transferred from my brain to paper properly.</p><p>Also
I will stop responding to everyone's review since I'm getting to
many, 11 since the last chapter really and well that would just take
up too much room, no one wants to read that most likely and would be
like lying saying the fic is much bigger than It really is.</p><p>GOOD
NEWS! My editor is back, which means all the chapters including
this one will finally be edited to good copies, and actually be good…
damn him going on vacation… anyways… He will edit all the
chapters so they will most likely have a new feel to them… He was
kind of pissed that I posted these without him editing it… now he
has to do a ton of work on something most people wont read. (he he
he) anyways, can't wait till he edits them and well, putting this
up just cause you guys deserve it and well… It will probly be
changed a lot so this is more of a "special edition chapter"
since it will most likely be dissected a lot by him… anyways… R&R
and well… the last 3 chapters will be put out most likely by the
end of next month… (long time… I'm guessing I'll finish by
mid next week but well… I didn't want to promise that and not
deliver) anyways on with the story!</p><p>GOOD
NEWS! Editor has returned, so the first 6 chapters were edited in
full, a lot of things like the fight with the hokage and how ino found
shikamaru are 100 changed, so well a lot of what you guys read before

X: I enjoy your fic a lot, just well… its been 17 chapters and yet
Naruto and Tsunade havn't done anything, they aren't even that
close yet, somewhat yes, but not a lot… and it's making me
impatient :P.</p><p>other
people: (since most of you had the same opinions): Thx for the
compliments, and well… I decided to write a Naruto/Tsunade fic, but
that one wont be updated as soona s this one, since I will be writing
a Love Hina fic at the same time. Both having hard partners so the
chapters will be updated as soon as I think of what's going to
happen next :P. the Tsunade/Naruto fix will be changed a little from
what I was going to do, anyways, can't wait and well… only 3
chapters left, what's gunna happen? Only I know :P.</p><p>- -

Slight lemon in this story… so watch out, slight masturbation… So
if your offended then skip it, it will be marked, and don't worry
this isn't too graphic.</b></p><p>"Why
can't you just leave us alone, why can't you just let us be? Why
do you have to bother us?" a frustrated Naruto asks his attacker,
frustrated with being interrupted from something that felt so good,
his first true experience of unconditional love.</p><p>"Because
you're a traitor, because she's a monster, because the Hokage was
assassinated trying to get out of his restraints." A cold voice
answered as another batch of random pointy objects flew in Naruto's
general direction.</p><p>"What
do you mean? Who would want to kill that old man?"<br>
"Didn't
you wonder why no Jounins or even Chuunins came after you?" He
didn't really, he was more occupied with surviving. "Why the ANBU
never caught up to you?" He did wonder that a little, but then he
had to save his and the Kyuubi's life "Why only genin have came
to chase you down? Naruto, you traitor, you made the perfect
distraction for the sand and sound!" (A/N: Didn't see that
coming now did you?) This shocked Naruto, he had inadvertently killed
the old man. <i>But who cares about him, he
wanted to take her from me, at least she cares, she would have cared
even if I didn't come for her. </i></p><p>Thud</p><p>Thud<br>
Thud</p><p>Unable
to think and run, Naruto had stopped, at a bad time to ponder the
girls words, two more kunai and a shurken were now imbedded in the
boy's body. He was weakening fast, blood was gushing from multiple
wounds, and he was still unable to get close enough to her to hurt
her.</p><p>Poof</p><p>The
impaled Naruto turned into a log, <i>Damnit, I
thought I got him, how could a dead last be so good against me, I
could almost hit Neji for christ sakes</i>. Looking around
frantically Tenten couldn't believe she couldn't find him. A
dead last was out smarting her, she was getting furious.</p><p>Then
an orange blur came at her from her right side, quickly she drew and
threw 4 kunai at the advancing nin.</p><p>clang<br>
clang</p><p>clang</p><p>clang</p><p>The
4 weapons were easily blocked. In retaliation Naruto quickly threw
the Kunai he held at Tenten. <i>Wow, he is
horrible with those.</i> The kunai soared easily past her as her 5th
kunai struck home, hidden in the shadow of the 4th kunai,
sticking right into the right side of Naruto.</p><p>poof</p><p><i>Damn,
shadow replication, and I didn't even sense his chakara molding,
didn't even see him, is he really that strong? Well I did hear he
killed Shikamaru and Ino… and we did recently find Sakura, so 3
dead, he killed 3 out of the rookie 9 already and it hasn't even
been 2 days yet! God I knew we should have just waited then sent
hunter nin… </i>Her thoughts interrupted by Naruto rushing her from
her left.</p><p>clang<br>
clang</p><p>clang</p><p>clang</p><p>poof</p><p>This
continued for a while, Naruto sending a clone and Tenten destroying
it using the shadow of one of her kunai to hide another one. Off in
the forest watching the two fight was the Kyuubi, clenching her
teeth. <i>She better prey he kills her because
If I get my hands on her, oh, she will prey for death, oh yes she
will. </i>Her eyes were already demonized, she could easily see
exactly what was going on, she could see what Naruto's opponent
couldn't, she could see that she wouldn't need to intervene.</p><p><i>Ok
one more time, I only need to send out one more clone to finish this,
one more clone and I can return to the Kyuubi, and maybe we can pick
up where we left off, heh heh… about to eat brunch. </i>"Shadow
replication! Ok, you know what to do, take this and go." Handing
the Clone the Kunai it rushed off knowing its fate.</p><p>clang<br>
clang</p><p>clang</p><p>clang</p><p>poof</p><p>Naruto's
plan was set, there was no way he could loose now. To Tenten he knew
that his sending of replications and the trowing of a kunai looked
like he was just trying to randomly hit her with a kunai, but she was
wrong, she was dead wrong. Naruto had waisted a lot of chakara, 29
clones worth to be exact. "Tenten, you loose," Naruto's voice
was loud and cold.</p><p>"How
so Naruto, haven't lost a drop of chakra, you… have lost a lot."
She was confused as to how someone could be so dumb thinking that she
would lose, he hasn't done anything to her.</p><p>"Look
around you, you loose, you thought that those kunai were aimed at
you, ha, look around you." Her eyes widened in fear as she looked
around, 10 wires were circling her, she couldn't move with out
being sliced up, she was a sitting duck to him.</p><p>The
Kyuubi was now grinning from her hiding place, she couldn't wait.
She wanted to see the carnage, the blood, she wanted to see her mate
(A/N: she considers him it already) take another life. She loved to
see the power of the man she loved, to prove that he was worthy of
the great demons love. Tenten's cries were music to the Kyuubi's
ears, she hadn't heard that sound in a while, even Sakura didn't
scream like that. She just loved it, she was getting hot, and the
pain was turning her on.</p><p>(A/N:
Begin small lemon) Biting down on her lip lightly, she just couldn't
hold it in, sleeping with Naruto with no release, killing Sakura with
no release, snuggling up to him earlier with no release, and now
this, she just couldn't take it. She slowly put her hand into her
pants, brushing her fingers up against her small patch of fire red
fur. Lower her hand went, until it reached it's destination. Slowly
she began to rub her self, her fingers getting coated in her own
juices. She was in ecstasy, finally a release to all the built up
sexual tension over the past couple thousand years. She watched her
Naruto dominate the girl, and she watched the girl turn into a
sniveling baby, they both turned her on further. As the battle
continued, she just watched on, slowly getting closer and closer to a
climax. (A/N: All over for now, small taste… didn't want to write
anything too long, so well, this will be it for now. And yes I do
think the Kyuubi gets turned on by pain and suffering, so that's
why that's here… I know its not that great but people were
begging and you know... must please my fans :P)</p><p>Quickly
10 wires jettison up from the branch they were resting on, visible to
the kunoichi now standing in a cage of death. Surrounded, she only
had one way out. Jumping up as fast as she possibly could to escape
the impending dismemberment. Too bad she wasn't fast enough, the
wires shot over removing her legs. "AHHHH!" A horrible scream
filled the air. A legless Tenten came crashing down onto the branch
she was previously on, a loud smack was heard all around. Slowly she
begins to tilt over, unable to stop her self she falls off the
branch, her body slammed into the ground and with a sickening crunch
it was over.</p><p>Her
blood was all over the ground, 10 red tinted wires slowly went limp
and fell; the real Naruto revealing him self as he walked over to the
now dead Tenten.(A/N: IMHO Tenten is good with weapons and not much
else, she would need to do all the hand signals and call out for the
replacement technique, which would take too long, that's why she
died and Naruto didn't… don't yell at me) The final crunch of
Tenten's body drowns out the Kyuubi's final moan before her
climax. Tenten's feet were still on the tree, as if her ghost was
still there. Tenten's body was broken in the ground, and the pieces
of her legs were strewn about around her. The Kyuubi's body was
tired and almost unable to move.</p><p>Naruto
almost made his way to the bloody mess previously known as Tenten,
then he fell to the ground. He had used much of his chakara and had
many wounds, from the kunai in his shoulder, to the multiple
scratches on his body from bareley missed projectiles, to the cuts on
his hands from holding the wire too tightly. As quickly as Naruto hit
the ground the Kyuubi was by his side. Luckily Naruto had fallen on
his back so the kunai wouldn't push in further. Slowly the Kyuubi
began to remove Naruto's clothes. He struggled against her. "Shhh
Naruto, I won't do anything that you don't want, just my saliva
will quicken the healing of your wounds, and by the sounds of things
you will need to be as good as new as soon as possible." Her words
soothed the young boy, he then laid on the ground quietly, not moving
or making a sound besides the rising and falling of his chest and him
breathing.</p><p>Kneeling
down beside Naruto, she lowered her head to his skin, licking up and
down each wound. As soon as her tongue touched his skin his pain
faded, her saliva making each cut shinier than it was. She began at
his right arm and slowly moved over to his left, and then down, she
was as gentle and sensual as she could be. But Naruto refused to let
her lick the wounds on some of his more private areas.</p><p>The
kunai still stuck in his shoulder really bothered her, she knew she
had to get it out. But, how? He couldn't heal without her in him,
and she didn't have any bandages… what could she do? Looking
around Naruto, she realized that he had a small first aid kit. <i>Wow,
I'm dumb, why didn't I see this earlier? </i>Slowly taking his
first aid kit and opening it, she noticed a few things she could use,
she took out the bandages and put them beside her, she also noticed a
small needle. <i>I'm sorry Naruto but this is the only way…</i>
She plucked a hair from her head and threaded it through the needle.</p><p>Lightly
she licked around the kunai careful not to cut her self on the sharp
blade. Quickly she removed the Kunai, Naruto's blood began to gush
out of the wound, and Naruto screamed in pain. "Shhhh Naruto, I
need to stich you up, be a good boy and stay still and I'll reward
you later." She talked to Naruto as if he was a small child as she
began to work on him, sewing his flesh shut was a difficult task, but
it went by quicker than she thought it would. Naruto didn't scream,
flinch or even move, the though of a reward was enough to keep the
boy calm. She then began to bandage up his arm, at least she knew
that he would heal soon, she just preyed that no one attacked them
with Naruto in the condition he was in.</p><p>-

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P>With the
Kyuubi's help Naruto was moved as far from the battlefield as they
could, before he collapsed from exhaustion. He had been going for
almost 2 days now, and he really needed some rest.</p><P>Their new camp
wasn't much of a camp at all. It was more of just as small clearing
surrounded by trees that was big enough to hold them both. Naruto
passed out from exhaustion and she laid him against a tree, the
Kyuubi felt badly about not being able to help the one she loved. She
had let him get hurt, she had done nothing, and she had sat there…
and pleasured her self while he got hurt.</p><P>Naruto awoke
after a few hours, still extremely tired. Normally he would have been
all good by now, but with the Kyuubi no longer a part of him, he
needed a more normal amount of rest. He was warmer than usual, and he
was snuggled into something soft. Slowly opening his eyes he sees
what he's pressed into, the Kyuubi looked as if she passed out on
him, her arm was draped over him. He didn't want to wake her, she
looked so peaceful, and she looked so beautiful. Slowly he brought a
shaking hand to her head and stroked her hair, it was so soft, so
untangled for something that hasn't been washed or brushed in two
days. "Mmm" a soft moan escapes her lips as she presses herself
closer into Naruto. Quickly he stops what he's doing, thinking that
she had woken up. As his hand moved away from her head she whimpered.
She was still breathing deeply. <I>I didn't wake her, good, I was
afraid she'd take that the wrong way… well there was only one way
anyone could take it… but still. </I></p><P>He began to
stroke her hair again. His fingers were on fire, covered in red hair
with the sun light shinning on it, giving his fingers a fire like
glow. Every once and a while she would give off soft moans in her
sleep, she was so beautiful, he wanted to wake up everyday this way,
he had just realized what he'd been missing, waking up knowing that
someone would love you now and forever. A large, genuine smile was
plastered on both of their faces. <I>Mmmmm that feels great. What is
that? Mmmmm it even smells good. </I>Slowly her eye's opened, the
first thing she noticed was that she was laying on Naruto, the second
was that he was stroking her head. <I>Does he like me? </I>"Mmmm
Morning Naruto-kun." Naruto froze at the sound of her voice, she
rolled over some so that she would be in a much more comfortable
position. "Naruto-kun what do you think of me?" She asked the
question so innocently. "Well I think your nice, and beautiful, and
sexy, and strong, and cool, and its nice talking to you… so I think
you're great!" The boy didn't understand what she was asking.</p><P>"No
Naruto-kun, I mean… what do you think of me in an emotional sense?"
Her voice wavered a little as she asked the new question.</p><P>"I-I-I uhh…
don't know…" the words left his mouth slowly, he was
stuttering, he didn't know how she would react.</p><P>As the words
hit her ears many things went through her head, she wanted to know
why, her eyes teared-up but they also turned demon, she was angry,
sad, she was confused. Biting her lip lightly she asks "why don't
you know?"</p><P>"I-I-I-" <I>Ok
calm down Naruto… take it easy… </I>"Well… I don't know…
I mean… sure your beautiful, and I want to protect you and I want
to spend time with you… but well you aren't of my species, you're
like a billion years older than me… and well… when ever I get
close to someone they hurt me…" His voice trailed off, he was
getting emotional and she knew that she'd stumbled onto a tender
spot.</p><P>"Naruto-kun…
haven't I done enough to gain your trust?" His words had hurt
her, but she also knew what he had been through.</p><P>"Well I gue-"
Naruto's words had been cut off by a kiss from the Kyuubi.</p><P>"Well, it
seems like I just have to do more." Slowly she climbs up and onto
him as she pushes him back, sitting in between his crotch and
stomach, her breasts at head level. Their breathing was hard, their
heart beats were fast, they both were caught up in lust; she'd been
wanting this for years, he'd been wanting this since he'd woken
up with her lying on him. They both knew this was wrong, but it felt
right.</p><P><B>Little
kiddies avert your eyes! For the evil of intercourse is upon
you, run, run away down to the next bold text, save your self!</B></p><P>Slowly she
began to rock back and forth lightly stimulating both of them through
their clothes. Their faces were flushed, both inexperienced in the
art of lovemaking. (A/N: I'm thinking that the Kyuubi wouldn't
want to spread her genes every where you know) The Kyuubi's
constant rocking was beginning to take effect on both participants,
Naruto was beginning to get hard, while the Kyuubi was getting wet,
their bodies were preparing for something they knew was coming. "Let
me tend to your wounds Naruto-Kun." She didn't wait for an answer
from the boy; she was already removing his jacket. Naruto was in
heaven, or at least he thought he was.</p><P>The layers of
clothes that separated them were quickly disappearing, first it had
been Naruto's jacket and shirt, the Kyuubi had ran her hands over
his chest over his new stitches, light enough not to break them. Her
touch had excited him more, and the feeling of touching Naruto made
her wet enough for her pants to begin to grow a spot. Then the
Kyuubi's mesh shirt was removed freeing her breasts from the
confining garment. By now she had begun to get a crisscross shaped
tan on her chest, once removed from the shirt her breasts bounced but
then returned back to their right full position, jiggling lightly as
she moaned, breathed or rocked.</p><P>A coat of sweat
covered her body. He wanted to touch her badly but he didn't know
if he was aloud, (A/N: Naruto is naive) but the Kyuubi had answered
his unasked question by taking his hand to her breast. As his hand
ran over her nipple she shuddered and moaned, he assumed that he was
doing the right thing by rubbing her erect nipple. His hand ran over
it, his fingers pinched it, he wanted to taste it and he did.</p><P>It had
surprised her when he had been bold enough to put her nipple into his
mouth, but she didn't mind, she liked it. Moan after moan escaped
her lips, a long thick line of the Kyuubi's juices stained Naruto's
pants, which by now seemed to be way too small. His erect penis
rubbed against her nether lips through their pants, it was a very new
experience for both of them, he'd never felt it before, she'd
never had this much care before.</p><P>He swirled his
tongue around her nipple, then pulled back. As her nipple left the
warm confines of his mouth she whimpered, and then shivered as he
blew cold air on to the wet nub. She squealed in pleasure as his head
moved over to the other nipple. Neither of them thought that they
would have gained so much from each other, they just wanted a release
but they got so much more. They had gained pure pleasure, an
understanding, a lover, trust, they had gained so much, yet they
still hadn't gained what they first intended on gaining.</p><P>Reluctantly the
Kyuubi removed her nipple from Naurto's mouth, he begged for it,
but she wouldn't let him. Slowly she began to kiss down him, from
his jaw line, to his neck, his stitches, down his chest, to his
waist. Hooking her fingers under his waistband she began to remove
his pants, at first he had tried to stop her but her soothing voice
had calmed him enough to let her continue. His pants were thrown away
carelessly, she then began to kiss her way back up his right leg
until she reached his boxers. She moved his boxer leg up an inch then
kissed the exposed skin, she repeated this action multiple times
until the leg was bunched up so much it couldn't go any higher.</p><P>Both Naruto and
the Kyuubi were getting impatient, they both wanted to satisfy each
other, they both wanted to do it now. The Kyuubi removed Naruto's
boxers and flung them away with the flick of her wrist. Naruto's
manhood stood erect, her eyes widened at the sight, it was large, at
least large for a human, she cursed her self for molding in a hymen.
She held his dick in one hand, it dwarfed her hand, her hand barely
went around his penis it was so thick. Slowly moving her hand up and
down along his shaft, she enjoyed the small hisses, growls and moans
that escaped his mouth.</p><P>Releasing him
and standing up, the boy unsatisfied and now unhappy scowled at the
girl, until he noticed what she was doing, shaking her hips from side
to side she very slowly began to remove her pants. Inch by inch they
fell revealing more and more of the girl, her fur, her lips, her
legs, all revealed in a painfully slow striptease. Getting down on
all fours, the Kyuubi moved towards Naruto, swishing her ass from
side to side as if she was wagging her 9 tails.</p><P>When she
reached Naruto she never stood back up, she just crawled, when her
head was over his erection she gave him a small nibble, then moved
on. Positioning him under her lips and her face in front of his,
kissing him deeply and sitting down quickly. Her tongue shot into his
mouth as a shooting pain went through her body, his dick slid into
her easily. It didn't take long for the pain to subside, as she
bounced up and down the pain turned into pleasure.</p><P>Naruto had
never felt anything like this before <I>Sooo tight. </I>He thought.
He filled her in every way, emotionally and literally. As she rode
him her breasts bounced up and down, every time they bounced up he
was afraid that she would hurt her self. Naruto had never seen
anything so beautiful before, her hair was flailing every where, her
breasts were bouncing, her nipples were erect and she was screaming,
everything just seemed to heighten the experience for him. He looked
into her beautiful eyes and she looked down into his, their lips met,
and then the Kyuubi broke the kiss and screamed louder than before,
she seemed to jerk a little, the Kyuubi was orgasming. Her cum seemed
to have gotten everywhere, and her pussy seemed to try and milk him,
her muscles convulsing, pulling, tightening, doing everything that
they could to get him to cum into her. Not wanting to disappoint, the
young boy exploded into her.</p><P>The Kyuubi
collapsed onto Naruto, Naruto began to go limp, they were both
covered in a mixture of female and male fluids. Naruto's penis soon
returned to normal size, and as it exited her pussy what ever fluids
that were still in her leaked out onto Naruto's left leg.</p><P><B>Lemon
ended! You may continue reading a safe story… well, relatively
safe.</B></p><P>The Kyuubi was
sitting in Naruto's lap, curled up and laying against him, her arms
around his neck, his arms were around her waist. Her head was resting
against his chest, his head was resting against hers. Holding onto
each other, they both felt loved, wanted, needed, they both didn't
want to move, but they knew that soon they would have too, but for
now they must rest. Soon the two fell into a blissful sleep.</p><P><I>Uzumaki
Naruto, I have found you again at last. You will pay but for now you
will rest, she seems to have wore you out more than any battle could.
For now you rest, tomorrow you will wake and we will fight, yes we
will fight. </I>A leaf shinobi stood watching over the two lovers. He
wanted to fight Naruto, he wanted to prove he was stronger than him
once and for all, and he wanted to do it when Naruto was ready.</p><P>-

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P>A/N: That is
the end of chapter 8 :P, hope you liked it. Don't try and get it
removed please, I warned you people and I told you when you could
read. Sure the lemon bits were a lot of this chapter but still… I
warned you, and this is what the people wanted and at least I didn't
put in any: Torture, humiliation, pain, anal, Oral, well pretty much
was just clean sex, nothing else, all good.</p><P>Anyways chapter
9 will be up soon… and chapter 10 will be up really soon after
that, then just one more chapter filled with answers and alternate
paragraphs… heh, will be fun to write.</p><P>Anyways some
stuff that doesn't seem to be explained well enough for some
people…</p><P>1) Sound and
Sand are attacking… you know this because:</p><P>- Tenten said
so<BR>- Tenten said the Hokage was dead and that Naruto had set it
up, well he had… Orochimaru made Naruto into a distraction by
releasing the Kyuubi… although not how he had planned… worked
just the same.</p><P>- also this is
happening during the Chuunin exam… which was when Orochimaru
attacked :p</p><P>2) The amount
of time that has passed in this fic is 2 days. No more no less…
almost 3 days, I guess when Naruto and the Kyuubi wakes up will be
the start of the 3rd day… wow… Naruto's done so much
in 2 days, lol.</p><P>3) Kyuubi is
almost useless in human form… except she's hot :P (heh heh)</p>

you know how much else I wanted to add but didn't cause it was
 bet
you can't guess who… well I'm not really giving you any time to
think about it so too bad haha… anyways how do you know he/she
didn't just catch them at the end of it, hmmm? How do you know
he/she didn't just notice that Naruto is naked holding a naked girl
and they are both tired and sweaty and theirs cum all over…</p><P>Naruto-sama the
kyuubi: Cause I want to, got a problem with that? Hmmm, what if I
just wanted it to be a Naruto saves the day fic hmmm… or maybe you
could wait and see if she's weak, faking it, doesn't care… or
maybe just maybe she was never strong in the first place and just
faked it, lol… anyways… On with the fic!</p><P>KatonKageNaruto:
Well you will be finding out who is watching them in exactly… 7
paragraphs… can you wait? Can you huh huh can you? I know I can't
that is why I had to write this like a few days after chapter 8 :P.</p><P>stroke-of-death:
Well I guess being hot isn't useless, she wrapped Naruto around her
finger pretty good.</p><P>madnarutofan:
Hope you got your cold shower, cause I wouldn't want you to miss
what happens in this and the next chapter, lol.</p><P>AzureSky123:
Well I'm old fashioned… I think that sex means something… I'm
most likely the last guy on earth who thinks so but also well… 12
year old boy + someone who loves him trust IMHO.</p><P>- - - - - - - -

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P><I>Mmmmm warm,
mmm soft, ugh smelly</I>. The morning came too soon for the two
lovers, both thinking that same thing, neither wanting to move, both
willing to tolerate the smell if they can stay holding each other for
a little while longer. Naruto raised his arm and lazily began to run
his fingers through the Kyuubi's hair, no longer soft and free, now
matted and greasy, the after effects of their wonderful night
together.</p><P>Unbeknownst to
them they were being watched. Now quite horny from looking at the two
naked bodies cuddled up to each other. The ninja from Kohona began to
masturbate trying to relive the tension. <I>I will bring you two
back, AHHHH! Ahhhh… much better…I will be the best, I will not
let you ruin my chances. </I>Looking back to where the two lovers
were cuddling, their hunter noticed they were walking away with their
clothes. <I>If they try and run I will attack, if they bathe then
good, will help me when I'm fighting, wont need to hold my breath,
haha. </I></p><P>Naruto and the
Kyuubi began to walk towards the stream that was only a little ways
away, oblivious to their hunter, forgetting that they were being
chased by an army of genin from Kohona. Upon arrival the two soaked
in the stream, not having anything to wash with they could do nothing
else, trying to wash off what they could.</p><P>The Kyuubi's
hair was now pressed against her body, not willing to let go from her
until they were dry. Naruto's hair lost its spikes and fell down.
<I>He looks so much better with his hair down, I hope he keeps it
down, it shouldn't interfere with his abilities. </I>She was
staring at him, a light blush on her face, he was wondering what she
was staring at; when he noticed it was him he blushed and turned
away. <I>Damn, now I can't see anything accept his back, no fair
Naruto-Kun. </I></p><P>After a 20
minute bath Naruto and the Kyuubi left the stream and shaking like
dogs (Old habit) they tried to dry off as much as possible before
putting on their clothes (A/N: Wet clothes are not fun.). Once
dressed they returned to their earlier position against the tree,
right now they thought they were invincible, they had each other,
Naruto thought he could take anyone who came after them, and if they
died at least they would be much happier than if they had died 4 days
before.</p><P>"A-Hem" The
clearing of someone's throat caught them off guard. Naruto had
moved the Kyuubi off him and was standing in a second, one fluid
motion. Looking around, trying to find out where the person that
interrupted them, the person who was most likely out to kill them,
was.</p><P>Stepping from
the bushes the Kyuubi's and Naruto's attacker let himself be
seen. "Prepare your self dobe, this will prove who is really the
stronger of us two, Kohona's demon, or the avenger of Kohona."
(A/N: no, he doesn't know about the Kyuubi, but since everyone
calls Naruto demon I made him just adopt that :P) Once Naruto's
best friend, now his enemy, Uchiha Sasuke, the avenger, prepared
himself by stepping into a fighting stance.</p><P>"Dobe send
your bitch away, this is between you and me." Sasuke's voice was
as cold as normal, but his eyes gave him away. He was excited, he
couldn't wait until he could fight Naruto. "What did you call her
teme!" Before Naruto could do anything he would regret, the
Kyuubi, who was by now standing grabbed his arm. "It's ok
Naruto-kun," her voice changed from normal to a whisper "besides,
technically he's right, I am a bitch, he he." The Kyuubi quickly
turned and walked away, a dark blush on both Naruto's and the
Kyuubi's cheeks. "So what dobe, did she promise you a nice fuck
when you win?" Naruto knew that Sasuke was just trying to get him
mad, but he just couldn't let the Uchiha get away with everything.</p><P>"Kage no
bushin!" Starting the fight off in normal Naruto style, as loud and
obvious as possible. Six Narutos rushed the prepared Uchiha. The
Naruto's attacked in a semi-circular formation making it harder for
Sasuke to leave unscathed. "Katon Gokakyo no
Jutsu!" A long line o fire shot towards the Narutos, attempting to
jump out of the way but failing, 2 Narutos were destroyed but the
other 4 continued their charge.</p><P>Sasuke
wasn't used to the desperation in Naruto's fighting. He was used to
the normal passion in his attacks, but that was dwarfed by how he
fought now. <I>Well what did you expect if he loses he dies and so
does she, if he wins they live to run another day, its fight or die…
even against me. S</I>asuke dodged the attack of the first
Naruto, he right hooked the second, and kicked the third, but he
could only do so much, he couldn't dodge the attack of the fourth.
<I>He can attack with 4 people, I can only attack two at a time…
Naruto has never put this much strategy into a fight before… I need
to do something to fix this. </I></p><P><I>Why
isn't he going all out on me? He hasn't activated the sharingan
and he's fighting slower. </I>Dispelling the last of his clones
Naruto stood in front of Sasuke. "Sasuke, why aren't you fighting
will all your potential, I'll kill you to protect her." The fire in
Naruto's eyes wasn't foreign but it was different, no longer did
it contain the stare of a demon behind them, now it was just pure and
undying determination. "Baka, I can't use my full potential, I
don't want to have to rely on someone else for power. Also, how
else am I supposed to fight? You can make hundreds of yourself. I can
only hit a few at a time, plus my sharingan would be mostly useless
against you, your not fast enough that I need it."</p><P>'Kage
no bu-" "Katon Gokakyo no Jutsu!" Naruto's most powerful
jutsu was cut off by Sasuke's fire jutsu. Appearing out of the fire
Sasuke began to attack Naruto in a seemingly endless combo of
attacks: right kick; block. Left punch, block. Elbow, block. Kunai,
block. Left kick, block. Right punch, block. Head butt, block.
Shurken, block. Without the Kyuubi Naruto and Sasuke were fighting at
about the same speed, neither being able to land a blow. As soon as
one gained ground the other beat him back. Neither fighter giving the
other any time to use anything besides taijutsu, their bodies were in
a seemingly endless dance of destruction. (A/N: I'm giving Naruto
and Sasuke about the same taijutsu abilities… I'm pretty sure
it's about even in the show/manga at this point…)</p><P>Both
people were getting pissed off, their original thoughts were that
they were going to win in a few minutes and could continue on with
their day. Continuing whatever they were going to do, but after an
hour of fighting both fighters were annoyed and getting tired. <I>I
wonder, should I use it, it would help me beat Naruto, but I don't
want to use power given to me, I need to earn it. </I>bam Sasuke
finally landed a blow, a right kick to Naruto's ribs. <I>Finally
I'm getting somewhere… wait… Naruto has more stamina than me
why is he more tired oh shi- </I>His thoughts were cut off as the
final syllable of tajuu kage no bushin was yelled.</p><P>50
Narutos now filled the area where Sasuke and he were fighting. Now
surrounded by Narutos, Sasuke didn't have much choice in what he
was going to do "Katon Gokakyo no Jutsu!" The fire blast shot out
<I>I don't want to use it, maybe I won't need to, maybe I will
get enough with this that I can just defeat them with normal blows.
</I>The fire engulfed many of the Narutos destroying them instantly.
Sasuke began to turn in a circle, the fire shooting out and
destroying what it could, but of course this strategy could only work
for so long. This technique used a lot of charka, there were too many
Narutos, and they were charging him.</p><P>"YA!"
the remaining Narutos rushed Sasuke, there were still a lot left
after that jutsu. They dog pilled onto Sasuke, totally burying him.
Their many bodies crushing him, suffocating him, trying to end this
without having to make the original Naruto make more clones. <I>Damnit
Naruto you made me do it, you just made me do it didn't you, you
just couldn't leave it well enough alone, you couldn't just lose
could you. </I>Killing intent hit Naruto so hard as Sasuke activated
the curse seal, although by now immune to killing intent Naruto still
shivered since this was coming from his former best friend. A surge
of chakra hit the young boy and the Kyuubi.</p><P><I>Naruto
was doing so well then… what was that? This isn't good if this
gets too out of hand… I don't know what I will do… </I>She was
hiding again because Naruto told her too, she was watching the fight
between the two. The remaining clones had by now been destroyed. The
now seal covered Uchiha rose from the ground after defeating the
Naruto clones in an insane combo of attacks. <I>I've seen that
before… this isn't good Naruto-kun, I hope you can handle this…
I would hate too see what would happen if you couldn't win. </I></p><P>Naruto
gazed forward at his ex best friend, he was different and just reeked
of power. Covered in seals, radiating evil. He wasn't the boy he
knew before, he wasn't the Sasuke he knew, now Naruto would have no
problem killing him… before he said he wouldn't hold back, but he
had lied, he could never really go all out on a friend, but now he
was no longer a friend, just another enemy.</p><P>"Tajuu
kage no bushin!" <I>I need to end this quickly. </I>A new army of
Narutos appeared surrounding both combatants making Sasuke lose sight
of Naruto. <I>Where did that baka go, I'll kill him if that's
what he wants. </I>. Sharingan!" For a second Naruto could
see Sasuke's red eyes, now with the second tick, but as soon as he
saw them they were already blurred by the new found speed Sasuke now
obtained. Faster and more powerful than<B></B>before Sasuke quickly tore into
the army of Narutos destroying them left right and center. The demon
of Kohona stood no chance against the powered up sharingan user. <I>Too
easy, now to find the real Naruto and end this. </I></p><P>The
army of Narutos quickly dissipated, soon only the true Naruto was
left, worse off than before, he'd been hit by the powered up Sasuke
a few times already. "Fine Naruto, I will end this now, this is
what you wanted, good bye dobe." Lowering his right hand and
grabbing his wrist with his left Sasuke began to power up a ball of
chakra "CHIDORI!" (A/N: I know he hasn't learned it yet, but
I needed him too for this story, sorry this is basically the only
unexplained thing really… or only thing that won't be explained…
don't hurt me please.)</p><P>The
Kyuubi watched the boy charge up the chidori. <I>What the hell is
that… oh god, Naruto-kun! </I>Running forward the Kyuubi tried to
make it to her lover before it was too late. She reached Naruto as
Sasuke's hand pierced his breast plate and his heart, without her
in him he would surely die. "NARUTO-KUN!" Her shriek was
horrible. Soon the tears began to fall as Naruto's corpse hit the
ground, his blood on the other boys hand staining the ground.</p><P>"Now
you will come with me, demon." His words cut into her. <I>He killed
Naruto-kun, he he he Killed him… and he dares call me a demon. HE
WILL DIE! I WILL RIP OUT HIS HEART AND EAT IT! HE WILL PAY DEARLY
FOR THIS! </I>The Kyuubi was no longer crying, standing up Sasuke
noticed the changes in her. <I>I've seen this before… when Naruto
fought Orochimaru… </I>The Kyuubi now had her orange aura about
her, long claws, Naruto's birth marks, long canines, and the red
demon eyes. <I>He-he-he had her inside of him! </I>Smiling evilly
with tear stains on her cheeks the Kyuubi was emitting so much
killing intent it actually killed what animals were still around the
pair that stood in the forest.</p><P>"You,
you killed him, you killed the only person to ever care about me…
the only person I ever cared about, and you will die." Slowly
advancing upon the Uchiha as he charged another Chidori. <I>I can
kill her too, I'm stronger than him, and she isn't supposed to be
powerful in this form, I can win. </I>The ball of chakra in his hand
was the only thing he could think of, he wanted to end this fast, and
no one cared if she died. He wanted to prove he was the strongest, he
wanted to prove that he killed the demon fox, something that not even
the fourth could do, apparently. <I>I can only do two of these before
I collapse… I hope I hit. </I>(A/N: heh heh… angry girl… RUN!)</p><P>-

CLIFFHANGER OF DEATH! Aren't I the meanest person alive? Didn't
expect that did you? Hmm hmm now did you? Day 3 is way more exciting
than day 1 or 2 eh? Well I don't have much else to say besides :D
can't wait to write chapter 10 the final chapter! Anyways now I
will add a tiny rant at the bottom of this because its been bugging
me…</p><P>Rant: Pairings:</p><P>Ok where do
people get these common pairings from?</p><P>Sasuke/Sakura:
Do you really think this could happen really? Sasuke would rather
kill his best friend then change his mind, will he really change his
mind about Sakura… maybe if she becomes as powerful as he is maybe…
but other than that there is a 0 chance they will get together…</p><P>Sakura/Naruto:
Could happen… maybe… but Sakura is as stubborn as Sasuke, really
she is… everyone else has moved on/ began to hate Sasuke but she
can't… even after 3 years of Sasuke being a traitor and almost
killing her teammate all she can think of is him… both Sasuke and
Sakura will die lonely…</p><P>Naruto/Hinata:
Hinata is too shy and Naruto has almost no interest in her at all…
I mean come on… he thinks of her more of a sister I guess… but
not as a love interest… she is too shy, too covered up and he
doesn't know enough about her.</p><P>Pairings that
could happen:</p><P>Naruto/Ino: I
know what you're thinking but really… two loud mouth blonds, they
have a lot in common, more than most people think really, they are so
in common I don't know why there aren't a ton of Naruto/Ino fics
out there really, I mean come on…</p><P>Hinata/Kiba:
She likes his doggie (lol), they are partners, they spend a ton of
time together, and they dress some whatly similar… and well it
would happen if she got over Naruto…<p>Tenten/Neji: (only
common pairing I like) this would most likely happen… I mean come
on they train all the time together, they get worried about each
other and Naruto changed Neji's view on the world… it would work…
they are getting closer and Neji is getting more open.</p><P>So well in
conclusion… most of the Common pairings suck and well… that's
about it (did this cause a) I wanted to b) its been bugging me c)
Editor wanted 3000 words and I wanted a cliff hanger endings :p.</p>

doing this because both stories will be hard to write, and when I'm
blocked with one I can write the other, keeping people more or less
happy :P.</p><P>Oh and thanks
for all the reviews, I got like… 7 in a day, lol, was hoping for

they do say that… but well… its been proven that you are more
likely to divorce if you are not similar… not exactly the same but
have a lot in common. If you aren't alike they will fight more
which will result in a separation (good to know eh, so girl looks for
guys that are like you, and guys look for girls that are somewhat
like you :P)</p><P>Arsenel: lol
you sound just like my friend… and there is no time for a
Sasuke/Kyuubi fic, lol… chapter 10 is last chapter (so this one).
Also I've already stated I HATE Sasuke and Sakura… they are
horrible people and well deserve to… be eaten by a Kyuubi possessed
Naruto while they are alive… ok nuff of that no one wants to hear
that, lol.</p><P>Skuld's Sentaro
5: I planned chapters 8-10 before the rest of the chapters, lol. Also
what do you mean by rushing it? Oh and I hope that this chapters will
make everything all better :P. Oh and when this is done my
Naruto/Tsunade fic starts so you can't be too unhappy.</p><P>madnarutofan: I
know, I can joke too… and yup yup, poor Naruto-kun tears why did
the big bad author have to do it? wait… oops… that's me runs</p><P>KatonKageNaruto:
No point in going longer, I didn't have anything else to write, and
Naruto woulda died so fast vs. Lee or Neji or a jounin… and well I
can start writing something else now… I also am somewhat bored of
this fic… (well I got bored at around chapter 7 but still)</p><P>Emissary of
Despair: You knew he would eh? Lol… well really if you saw the
Kyuubi all naked and sweaty, and naked, and bouncing, and naked and
moaning… who wouldn't? and well all your questions shall be
answered in this chapter so… read on!</p><P>-

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P><B>WARRING:
VERY VIOLENT! Sorry… couldn't make it any other way, this
chapter alone makes this fic a MA ratting… you have been warned. </B></p><P>Sasuke was
sweating; the heat from the Kyuubi's chakra was overwhelming. Her
body would burn instantly from the intensity of her charka, but would
heal just as fast, she didn't show any signs of tiring, just pure
anger directed towards the last Uchiha in Kohona. The small squeaking
ball in his hand was finally complete. "You will die." Her voice
was diabolic, it sent shivers down the now powered up Uchiha's
back. "Not before you, wench." Sasuke's right hand shot
forward, piercing her in the same place Naruto was. Her blood
splattered all over Sasuke's arm and the right side of his chest.
Her perfect left breast was decimated, completely gone.</p><P>Her eyes went
blank and she slumped forward. Removing his hand from her chest he
was completely unsatisfied. <I>After all that… that was all she had
to offer. At least I killed her… I'm totally drained.
</I>"Ahahahahaha." Diabolic laughter escaped from the lips of the
dead corpse on the ground, lifting her self back up revealing that
her would was completely healed. "T-That was all you had, ahahaha,
that was the power of the Uchiha clan? Don't you know who I am? You
puny weakling, I am the Kyuubi no Kitsune, the most powerful demon.
And you, you're just human, useless, powerless, and now, you will
die."</p><P>A horrible
scream was heard by everyone. The female voice was sickening.
Floating a few feet off the ground, held up by her chakra, her back
bent in a huge arc backwards, the power of the chakra that was
surrounding the girl surged exponentially, quadrupling in power and
almost making it impossible to see the girl inside. Sasuke didn't
know what was happening, but he knew it was bad, the Kyuubi was
smiling even though she was obviously in pain.</p><P>The giant ball
of burning red chakra made everyone in Kohona freeze, the sand army,
the sound army, the defending shinobi, all stood still, wondering who
had created such a large amount of evil chakra. Anyone who was in
Kohona during the attack by the Kyuubi knew what it was. The army of
Kohona trembled, their strength gone, fell to their knees. Many of
them whispering "Oh god not again, not again." Seeing the
reaction to their enemies the sound and sand got scared. Many sand
and sound shinobi wondered what was so horrible it could do this too
their enemies… wondering what had happened, wondering what was
coming.</p><P>Now 7 Giant
tails were extruding from the sphere, and the 8th tail was
beginning to show, a small nub close to the other tails, slowly
growing larger and larger. Sasuke was frozen, he didn't know what
has happening, first there was a useless human, and he killed her.
Then she revived and told him she would kill him, and now this! <I>What
is going on, what is that? What jutsu could do this?</I></p><P>As the 9th
tail finished appearing, Sasuke had realized what he had done. <I>Oh
god, what have I done… she told me she would kill me… I never
thought she would…turn back into that… I never thought… </I>A
pair of giant legs slowly began to form, 9 giant tails swishing from
side to side destroying everything they touched: the trees, the
ground, the rocks, everything.</p><P>The faint image
of a laughing fox head was showing, created by the Kyuubi's chakra
but still unformed. The giant ball with tails was no longer floating,
a pair of powerful legs was holding it up. Stretching out, the ball
began to grow, larger and larger, now easily visible to everyone in
Kohona, everyone in the surrounding area, and now everyone was
scarred. They knew what was coming, no one expected it, but it was
happening again.</p><P><I>What have I
done, if I had just left it in him… my plans wouldn't have been
ruined… damn kid! </I>Orochimaru although thinking he was brave was
still frozen in spot looking at the ball of red chakra slowly forming
a gigantesque body. He never wanted to unleash that… he just wanted
his container. <I>Oh god, where is Sasuke… ok lets think, where are
the leaf genin… out to get Naruto… ok… and… oh shit! Who's
the only one strong enough to defeat him… god damnit that kid
ruined my plans, my perfect plans… the sharingan will be lost for
ever, I need to get over there. </I>The evil sanin willed himself to
move towards the beacon of pure evil, towards what he hopped wasn't
certain death.</p><P><I>She… is
different than what everyone tells us… </I>The Kyuubi wasn't the
giant evil looking fox demon everyone portrayed her as. She was an
elegant fox, her fur shinned from the glow of her chakra, her legs
were long and lean, her tails were shaped perfectly, never loosing
their shape even after destroying trees and ground; never seeming to
get dirty. Her face wasn't in an evil sneer, it wasn't all sharp
and ugly, it was quite beautiful for an animal. Long and perfect, she
was… Perfection, her body was gorgeous, her power was unmatched,
and now no one had the power to stop her again. (A/N: Think of the
female fox from Fox and the Hound, but with 9 tails…)</p><P>Looking down on
the cowering Uchiha, the Kyuubi was disgusted. "This, this is what
they sent to defeat me, ha." Lowering her head to the level of
Sasuke she began to speak to him, in a quiet voice, void of emotion.
"You underestimated me, you thought you could kill the most
powerful demon with a simple jutsu… not even your 4th
Hokage could kill me, what made you think you could? Your village
should have just left us alone, you killed the only person to ever
like me for me, and you took away the only person I truly loved…"</p><P>Her voice began
to get more harsh, her eyes were shining with anger and she was
emitting an amount of killing intent only available to the angriest
of angry women (A/N: hehe, don't hurt me.) "and now… you and
your village will have to pay for what you have done. You call me a
demon, you couldn't just let two people who loved each other be
alone, and now you will have to suffer the consequences… don't
start something you cannot finish."</p><P>With a
sickening crunch she put her paw on Sasuke's right leg. "You
killed him, you will pay the most, you will suffer the most, this is
your punishment for failing your mission." Her claws extended from
her paw cutting into Sasuke's flesh, not enough to kill him but she
knew it hurt. Her claws didn't only cut into him, they were large
and they pulled the skin up, so at the tops of the wounds Sasukes
skin was bunched up.</p><P>Another chakra
source was coming closer to her and her prey, one much larger than
the one that was under her paw, but of course nothing close to her
own. "Someone's coming for you, or me, or maybe both, really I
don't care." Her head lowered and severed Sasuke's left arm,
the Kyuubi burned his wound closed with her Chakra. "Wouldn't
want you dieing now would I?"</p><P>Orochimaru
reached the area in which the Kyuubi now inhabited, quickly, fearing
for his containers safety he ran as fast as possible. The scene that
met him was horrible, even by his standards. Sasuke was being held by
one paw as she slowly removed his limbs, then sealed the wounds
closed. <I>M-m-my container, gone, the eyes all gone, that bitch she
will pay! </I></p><P>"I wouldn't
interfere if I was you, you are no match for me, and he, he killed my
mate. He will die one way or another, and you, you can run, you
aren't of Kohona, and you set me free, I have no grudge against
you, but if you attack me, I will kill you." The Kyuubi's words
were confusing to the snake sanin. <I>Not as powerful? Can go free?
Killed mate? </I>"What do you mean by killed your mate?" He was
confused. <I>There was a second giant fox that Sasuke killed?</I></p><P>"He killed
Naruto-kun, the only man I ever loved; now he will pay." Her voice
was racked with sadness. <I>How could the most powerful demon be sad
because of the death of a human? </I>"How could you be sad because
a weak human died?" Instantly he knew he had used the wrong words.
"WEAK!" Her anger flared, her flames burned higher, and
Orochimaru stood no change. "HE WAS THE STRONGEST MAN I EVER KNEW!"</p><P>Sasuke was
terrified, <I>I'm saved, Orochimaru arrived, but they are only
talking</I>, he was strong enough to hear them. <I>Did Orochimaru say
something wrong? He shows fear… and she, she's angry… oh god.
</I>One of the Kyuubi's tails Impaled the snake sanin in a horrible
manner, from bottom to top, splitting him in two, a horrible sight,
good thing only someone who wouldn't live much longer saw it.</p><P>"Now, I will
continue with you." Crushing his left leg the Kyuubi continued with
her work, slowly amputating him, closing his wounds with charka burns
so he wouldn't die. She took off his right hand, then a bit higher,
then higher, cutting off his arm in three inch pieces. For something
so large, she was quite precise with her cuts.</p><P><I>I'm done
with this, time to finish it. </I>With a swipe of her claw she cut
open Sasuke's face, his right eye in between her claws (A/N:
talented eh.) she held the eye in front of Sasukes other eye. "What
do you think of your precious sharingan now? You are pitiful. Naruto
was ten… no a hundred times the man you are, were…" Sasuke was
whimpering now, praying for his life, and then she removed her paw
from his other leg and stamped on his chest, turning his insides into
a gooey paste filled with bone fragments.</p><P><I>Time to move
on, Kahona will pay for this… yes they will pay! </I>The Kyuubi was
up in an all out frenzy, she destroyed everything she could, the
trees, the ground, the animals, any people who got in her way.</p><P>Upon reaching
Kohona she saw three armies of Shinobi lined up, most of them were
shaking, a few wet themselves, others ran instantly upon seeing her
approaching. "Ahahaha, I hope you are stronger than Orochimaru,
because the legendary snake sanin died with one swipe of my tail."
Her 9 tails lashed out at the ninja, many jumped out of the way, many
weren't so lucky, burned by the chakra, crushed by its weight, cut
by the tip which seemed to be as sharp as a sword.</p><P>"Puny
shinobi, going against me, you killed Naruto-kun, you must pay."
The affectionate way she spoke about Naruto confused some, the pan in
her eyes and sadness in her voice confused the rest… <I>wasn't he
the demon... wasn't he the Kyuubi? </I>"You stupid humans,
thinking that that boy was me, he is much stronger than any of you
could have been… he didn't give in to me, he was strong, he kept
his own identity instead of merging with mine, he had his soul and I
had mine. Now that he is gone, I have no reason not to kill everyone
in the despicable village. While he lived, he wanted to save this
village, I respected his wishes, but once you betrayed him…"</p><P>The Kyuubi's
speech confused almost everyone, <I>He wasn't the demon? But
but…that means I tortured an innocent kid. </I>The few remaining
people who knew Naruto were perplexed. <I>Naruto is dead? Orochimaru
is dead? What of Sasuke. </I>"Oh and if you are wondering, the
Uchiha brat killed him, using Orochimaru's cursed seal… only way
he could beat him, using someone else's power. Oh, and no he isn't
alive, I made sure of that." A sadistic grin appeared on the
Kyuubi's face for a second, but then it was gone, replaced by her
neutral stare once again.</p><P>"Now, let us
begin, I don't want to waste a lot of time destroying this puny
village, full of weaklings, full of hate, full of… pain. You hurt
him too much, you hurt me, now it's time for you to hurt." She
moved into a fighting stance, her tails flailing wildly, her chakra
flaring, and her killing intent was so strong that even many of the
experienced jounins found it hard to move.</p><P>"Here I
come." Those three words scared everyone more than anything they
have ever seen, done, or heard before.</p><P>Thousands of
shinobi were present, once enemies' now three villages joined
forces to fight a common enemy. Unfortunately no one stood a chance.
Hundreds of Genjutsus were used against the Kyuubi, but she just
laughed it off. "Do you not think that my demon eyes can see right
through those puny illusions… you want to see a true genjutsu then…
here!" The world around the army of shinobi turned into fire, their
bodies burning where they stood, tentacles of fire latched onto what
ever they could hold, keeping the shinobi still. "This is a
genjutsu, this is all in your mind, but I don't think that you
could break this very easily… I will sit here and wait for you to
come to your senses… I do hope you come to them soon. I haven't
had this much fun…" her voice changed, "… and pain…" a
low whisper, "… in a very long time."</p><P>The skin of the
Kyuubi's enemies was boiled, charred, and looked horrible,
especially where the tentacles touched. Their wounds real because
they thought they were, they couldn't break free of the genjutsu.
<I>Damn, this is getting boring…if some don't break free soon
I'll just break the genjutsu and get right to it… </I>The wounded
shinobi slowly began to realize that all of that was just an
illusion, no one believe the Kyuubi even after she told them. Slowly
they began to help the other shinobi out of their horrible dream.</p><P>"I see you
got free… eventually… good, at least your worth keeping around
for a little while longer, I was about to just break it and kill you
all. Getting back into her fighting stance, she began the fight
again. This time with most vigor, she wanted them to hurt, she wanted
them to die, and she wanted them to pay with their lives for ever
wronging her and her mate.</p><P>Tens of
thousands of shuriken and kunai flew towards the Kyuubi, everyone
hoping that this could at least slow her down a little… maybe.
Although the pointy objects cut through her skin and impaled
themselves into her, her gigantic size made the weapons almost
useless. "Is that all you got? Those tiny weapons… they feel like
bug bites." Her horrible laughter served to further demoralize the
defending army. <I>They will die soon; I'm too good at this. I was
hoping for more fun, maybe I will find some in the city when I get
there. </I></p><P>The shinobi
tried as hard as they could, their combined might was gigantic. There
were many different types of taijutsus, genjustsus and ninjutsus
being used against the fox demon. Three different types of shinobi,
three different villages, many different techniques all useless.
Although to any normal person the shinobis power would seem too great
for anything, unluckily they were against the Kyuubi, which had an
infinite amount of power at its disposal. The many shinobis'
attacks were a waste of time against the giant fox, nothing could
harm her, and without someone who could use the 4th's
sealing technique there was no way to stop her.</p><P>Her claws were
sharper than any kunai, her teeth could shred anything, and the power
of her 9 tails was colossal. The 9 tails of the Kyuubi rained down
more death upon the shinobi of the 3 villages than any war any
village had ever participated in. It hadn't even been an hour and
already there were hundreds of deaths. The remaining shinobi were
trying to organize an evacuation of the city, but sadly every time
someone tried to get to the city the Kyuubi would destroy them.
"Tisk, tisk, no running from me, unless I let you."</p><P>The numbers of
ninja dwindled considerably every minute. Every attack sent against
the giant fox demon would be useless and returned ten fold. Each air,
water, fire, and earth jutsu was returned with much more force than
what the shinobi could do. Over powered and losing quickly, the
shinobi opted for a tactical retreat. <I>They are running away… but
to where? I'm coming for the city, do they really think I can or
won't destroy it? Might as well let them run… I'm faster than
them anyways.</I></p><P>The sand, sound
and leaf shinobi retreated back to the city. They had to warn the
citizens, they had to evacuate everyone, and with the wall here it
would be easier to defend Kohona.</p><P>The large fox
demon was quickly approaching the hidden village of the leaf. Her
large and powerful legs propelling her much faster than any human
could ever go, gigantic leaps and bounds, the trip to the leaf
village took seconds, while all of the shinobi were still well behind
her. <I>Stupid humans, thinking they could out run me… I'm like
9,000 times their size, and foxes are faster than humans anyways…
idiots.</I></p><P>She stopped
just outside of the village walls. <I>This will be fun, a lot of fun;
I will avenge you Naruto-kun. </I>Running full tilt at the huge wall,
the Kyuubi's sleek body was more or less a battering ram, her body
slamming into the wall, piercing the barrier that separated her from
the defenseless interior of the village of the leaf. <I>Finally I am
in, I am in the village, they will pay, all of them will pay. </I></p><P>The
unsuspecting village of the leaf was in a complete panic. The Kyuubi
fox was attacking again, and she had broken through the army, through
the wall, through everything that could stop it, there was no saving
them now.</p><P>The Kyuubi's
tails wagged back and forth lazily. She was looking at her prize, she
had earned the destruction she was about to bestow upon this town.
Slowly moving forward, her paws leaving giant footprints in the
concrete, her tails wagging back and forth destroying everything they
touched, and the Kyuubi wore a look of pure glee upon her face.</p><P><I>We are all
going to die, we're all dead, what did we do to deserve this? </I>The
villagers were scared and confused, what had they done to deserve a
second attack by the Kyuubi, luckily they wouldn't have to last
long for an answer.</p><P>"Citizens of
Kohona, I am your judge and juror, you are being charged with
multiple counts of assault, attempted murder, harassment, assault
with a deadly weapon, neglect, and worst of all, murder in the first
degree, the murder of my mate. The murder of Uzumaki Naruto. You are
found guilty; your sentence is death by my hand… er paw."</p><P>As the Kyuubi
finished talking the citizens of Kohona panicked. Trying to run for
their lives but it was futile, the only exit to the city was blocked,
they were surrounded by walls and the forest of death they had no
where they could go. The streets of Kohona were packed with panicking
people. The chaos excited the Kyuubi.</p><P>The remaining
shinobi were still about 30 seconds behind the Kyuubi, they heard the
crash and the Kyuubi's booming voice, and they knew that by now
they were already too late so save the village.</p><P>The Kyuubi was
preparing to attack when she saw something that froze her. In front
of the giant demon fox stood the Konohamaru crew. Three small human
children stood defiant in front of the fox demon. She recognized them
immediately as the three brats who idolized Naruto.</p><P>The three
children were scared; the demon looked a lot scarier close up than
far away. Standing in front of her with their practice kunai drawn
they stood defiant of the giant beast. "We won't let you destroy
Kohona!" "Ya, you demon go away!" "Leave us alone!" "Naruto
wouldn't want you too destroy his home!" The voices of the three
children were indistinguishable to the giant fox. She didn't care,
she did care about what they had to say though.</p><P>"Foolish
children, what could you do to stop me? I have defeated almost all of
you, the sand and sound shinobi at the same time. And what would you
know of what Naruto-kun would want… he left here because no one
accepted him, no one loved him, no one wanted me… he killed to save
me, he killed leaf shinobi to save me! A demon!" Tears were falling
from her eyes, giant balls of water fell from her eyes. "They
killed the only person I ever loved, they will pay. Now move, I don't
want to destroy people that Naruto cared about, people who never hurt
him, but if I have to I will."</p><P>The Konohamaru
crew was shaking, they were scarred but they wouldn't move.
Persistent as they were, when the Kyuubi moved her paw above the
three children, they fell into the fetal position and just quivered
there. Preparing to be smashed they never expected for the Kyuubi to
just push them out of the way and then continue on her war path. "You
three are lucky he liked you, or I would have killed you with no
remorse, you are only human children, but I owe him."</p><P>Her foot steps
shook everything around it, for a long while when ever one of her
foot paws fell the Konohamaru crew would bounce around for a little
while. They were stunned, they were confused, they were thankful,
they cried.</p><P>The Kyuubi was
unfazed by the sound of crushing bones as she stepped onto fleeing
humans accidentally. <I>I'll have to take a nice long bath after
this… </I>She destroyed everything she walked passed, buildings,
people, the road, monuments. <I>I will leave things that he loved,
things that liked him… like Ichiraku Ramen… </I>The small store
had kept her love alive, she at least could leave it alone… just
like the Konohamaru crew, and she would also leave the Hokage
Mountain alone. <I>Except maybe I should carve his face into it…
hmmm… I'll have to think about that. </I></p><P>The 9 tails of
the Kyuubi were deadly even when she wasn't thinking about them,
they swayed from side to side as she moved her hips, the tails
crashing into houses and stores, crumbling them upon the people
inside and around the building. Lost in thought the Kyuubi never
realized she was slowly destroying the once powerful ninja village by
leisurely strolling through it.</p><P><I>I hope I get
out, I hope I don't get crushed, I hope I live, I'm still a
virgin, I need to live! I need to live to get a husband, and a child…
ooo I want a child. </I>A young woman was running through the streets
not really paying attention to where she was going until it was too
late. bump She had run straight into the Kyuubi. Looking up at the
giant demon all she could do was scream. And scream she did, so loud
it actually hurt the Kyuubi's ears. <I>Stupid human. </I>The giant
claws from the Kyuubi's claws shredded the annoying human, allowing
the Kyuubi to return to her thoughts.</p><P><I>Well… I've
spent enough time here…I would really like to get out of this
reached place as soon as possible, enough reminiscing. Time for some
real destruction, </I>the Kyuubi seemed to have snapped out of a
trance. Looking behind her she noticed the destruction she left in
her wake. <I>Wow… I've been doing that while I walked… what
ever… saves me time. </I></p><P>The Kyuubi no
Kitsune jumped into the air. To any innocent bystander it would look
like she was going insane, but as she hit the ground her insanity
soon turned into genius, using her weight she landed on the ground
creating a mini earth quake, the ripple in the ground extended in a
circle collapsing the foundations of many buildings. Although not
extremely effective it was quite fun, and what's the point of
destroying a hidden village if you don't have fun?</p><P>Hopping around
like a giant rabbit, the Kyuubi destroyed parts of the village
giggling merrily at the destruction and death she was creating. The
screams of the villagers was music to her demonic ears, the crunch of
their bones a beautiful sounds, and the knowledge that what she was
doing was justified made her feel much better about all this.</p><P>The third day
that the Kyuubi was free was the most eventful, most painful, most
memorable. The day was coming to an end, the Kyuubi was getting
tired, she wanted to sleep, she wanted her Naruto-kun, she wanted
everyone to pay. Now bored with hopping around like an idiot, bored
with just destroying things accidentally she went to work. She was
going to end this soon.</p><P><I>I'll just
do this the easy way, then maybe I can get some rest. </I>She stopped
jumping and started to destroy the village the easy way with her
tails. Bored and wanting to finish this, her 9 tails whipped around
quickly, slamming into buildings sending pieces of concrete at
tumbling down upon the people below, rocketing some of the debris at
other buildings.</p><P>She was no
longer playing around, the village was being destroyed at a fevered
pace, homes, shops, the hospital, the ninja school all being
destroyed quickly. Each sweep of each of her tail's destroying
multiple buildings, her paws destroying the streets below her, and
she ate what ever human got foolish enough to wander close to her
mouth.</p><P>The shinobi
that made it back to Kohona were greeted by a horrible sight, the
Kyuubi had already destroyed most of the village, when they arrived
she looked like she was finally getting down to business. They tried
to stop her once again but it was futile, too few ninjas were left,
not enough chakra, she was just too powerful.</p><P>She had finally
made it to the Hokage's tower. A honorific place, a place she
despised, a large tower where the man who had ordered her an
Naruto-kun's death used to live. She was going to take extra
special care with this place, and she did, she tore down the entire
building, leaving nothing standing. The debris pilled up, even though
the building was destroyed she wasn't done, smashing what was left
of the tower into a fine powder, she used that to fill the part of
the Hokage tower that was underground.</p><P>In an hour's
time the village of the hidden leaf was destroyed. The residential
sector was gone, the commerce sector was gone, the ninja school was
demolished, the Hokage's tower was so destroyed that you couldn't
tell something was there in the first place. She had carved Naruto's
face into the Hokage Mountain, a tribute that would always be there
to the greatest ninja to ever come out of Kohona. The village was
gone, the people were dead, three armies were decimated, it was time
to rest.</p><P>Slowly (well
for her it was slowly... incredibly fast for anyone else) she found
her way back to where Naruto's body rested. The area he was in was
splattered with his, hers, Sasuke's, and Orochimaru's blood.
Bodies and pieces of bodies lay all over the clearing. <I>This… is
no place for me or Naruto-kun to rest. </I>She went over to the body
of the young boy she loved. Gently picked him up in her mouth and she
walked off.</p><P><I>I'll never
leave you Naruto-kun… I love you… </I>In the middle of what was
left of the forest, the Kyuubi made a large clearing. She put down
the body of the young Leaf nin in the cleared area and laid down
beside it. Pushing the body towards her, she snuggled the young boy,
letting her tails cover him up and most of her, she fell into an
eternal slumber beside the young boy who melted her black heart, the
young boy who saved a village, and destroyed it, the young boy who
never felt love until he was with a demon.</p><P>Next to Naruto
a demon who never knew love, never knew happiness unless she killed,
next to Naruto the strongest of demons lay. Next to Naruto the Kyuubi
slept in eternal slumber with her true love. Her heart melted and
yearning, her body left wanting, her soul left needing. She laid next
to him a sleep, hoping that one day they would be together again.</p><P>-

- - -</p><P>A/N: wasn't
that fun :P… I had a good time writing it, lol. Anyways please ask
any questions that you want answered now… I will post one more
chapter full off omitted stuff, and things that my friends suggested,
also answer to questions, but after that I will not look at this fic
most likely ever again, lol.</p><P>My next fic
will be two actually, two hard ones that I wanted to do but will be
hard to write, so while looking for ideas for one, I'll write the
other… they will be for two different animes/mangs though sorry one
will be:</p><P>Naruto/Tsunade:</p><P>He
had spent three years away from his village. He yearned to come back;
the people there didn't want him back. His only friend while away
was a perverted hermit. His friends in his village had all forgotten
him, all but one… He returned only to be hated, the villagers
hated him more, his friends forgot him, the girl he loved despised
him for not brining his best friend back, his favorite place to eat
had long since shut down, and his landlord had evicted him. He only
had two people who cared about him left, his sensei, and the woman
who could never forget him, the woman who loved him, a woman he cared
about deeply as well… When Uzumaki Naruto returns, will he sink
into a world of depression, or will Tsunade, the one woman who still
cares about him, save him from him self?</p><P>And then a Love
Hina one (I recommend everyone read/watch this… good manga/show…):</p><P>Keitaro/Tsuruko:</p><P>She came to
visit her sister, what she found was a broken man. Cowering at her
feet, praying for forgiveness for a wrong doing he hadn't
committed. <I>What has happened to him? </I>Can she save him? Will
anyone be able too? <I>What has my sister and Narusegawa done to him?
</I>Can Aoyama Tsuruko keep Urushima Keitaro safe? Will a broken man
and a widow fall in love?</p><P>-
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P>You're lucky
that I like you guys who are giving me reviews cause well, I could
have just went and done my Love Hina one and left you guys out to
dry… or could have went and started one staring an OC of mine that
I can't wait to start :p. Anyways… I will not leave a fic
unfinished so well… one day I will writing my Naruto/Ino fic and my
OC one… but not now, not for a while… anyways till the last
chapter a more of a "delete scenes/ authors commentary / Q&A
session" thing than a chapter… but w/e…</p><P>Final A/N:
Going to put up the final "chapter" of this story in one week, so
get your questions, comments, and reviews it. (I'd like to get 100
one day on this fic… would be nice) anyways… Hope you had fun
reading this, time for my small vacation, woot.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 13</h3><hr><br><P>This is the final thing
that is going into this story.</p><P>I'm sorry but I will
not be writing the other bit that I promised… but well I just want
to put this story behind me now, I liked writing it, but now it is
done.</p><P>Also I would like to
say that I'm going to write another story soon, when I get time
(most likely chat 1 will be up mid next week) anyways I don't think
it will be the naru/tsu story, sorry but well… I have an idea for a
story, and well… I want to write that instead, the only thing is I
don't have a pairing for it, and I will need to get that voted on…</p><P>Anyways I would like it
to be a naru/<p>Ino (my fav, lol)<p></p><P>Temari<p></p><P>Ten/Ten<p></p><P>Kurenai<p></p><P>Anko<p></p><P>Tsunade (I guess I
could do this, with the story I want to write, but well… it will be
a long time till the first time Tsunade and Naruto meet and well that
isn't any fun…)<p></p><P>Shizune (Same as
Tsunade)</p><P>Will NOT do:<p>Sakura
(I hate her…)<p>Hinata (I think Naruto/Hinata is over done
sorry)</p><P>Just to give u an idea
what the story will be:<p>Naruto discovers the Kyuubi earlier,
and starts to use its power earlier in his life. Training in secret
he slowly begins to be able to use the Kyuubi's full power.
<p>Basically I really like Naruto and I want to make it like I
think it should have been, the Kyuubi, seeing her (I like the Kyuubi
being female…) container being threatens, makes it stronger so she
can survive. Naruto, being able to use the Kyuubi's power, is a
powerful shinobi, one of the top in the academy (not dead last)</p><P>But because of the
parents reactions the kids still don't like him very much…</p><P>Sorry everyone, but
this is what I want to write, because it really isn't written a
lot… really it isn't… usually when he gets trained by the
Kyuubi he becomes ultimately powerful and can like flick Itachi and
he will die. I do not want this, Naruto will still be a genin but
everyone still needs to know he was the most powerful demon in him,
this will make him better than pretty much any genin, and weak
chuunin. With training and time he will be more powerful than anyone,
when he can use the full power of the demon fox, the un-killable
demon… it is inevitable and what would happen…</p><P>I'm very sorry to
disappoint u, but if I do make a tsu/naru fic… it will not be very
good and I don't wana do that… (and well technically this could
be a tsu/naru but it will be a while till Tsunade shows up. He has to
go from like 7years old – like 13 before they can meet… then like
a lil while for their relation ship to get to friends, then a long
while to get to more than friends (he's like 15 she like 53… it
would take a long time, lol)</p><P>Anyways tell me what u
want, I'm guna start writing tomorrow so well… ya…</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 14</h3><hr><br><P>Well, I have decided to return. I
continuously get messages, Pm's, e-mails, and reviews of my stories.
I did not think they were this good until recently (when every day I
would get up to 7+ more reviews or pm's...)</p><P>I will return to writing with a new
story, what it will be about I do not know yet, but I hope you will
like it... Most likely it will either be a Naruto story... Or I will
make a Warhammer one (I am waiting for W.A.R heh...)<p></p><P>But until then, I will post a few
originals... two I made for a class and a few unfinished stories that
I don't like or plan on continuing unless people want me too...</p>
</div>
