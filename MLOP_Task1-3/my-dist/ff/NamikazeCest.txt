This is a work in progress so first lemon may be horribly unerotic... I'm so nervous; let get started.</b></p><p><b>Kyuubi:17</b></p><p><b>Naruto: 10</b></p><p><b>I own nothing.<hr size=1 noshade></b></p><p>Kyuubi and Naruto were watching TV. Not really bothering to do anything, since Kushina and Minato were out for the day, Kyuubi was in charge.</p><p>"I'm bored!" exclaimed Naruto, not one for sitting down for any periods of time. "Can I sit on you Kyuu?" Sighing Kyuubi nodded. Naruto clapped, climbing on to Kyuubi's lap.</p><p>15 minutes later after SpongeBob Squarepants had successfully captured little Naru's attention, he began rocking back and forth enjoying the vibrations (not like that you perverts X3)</p><p>Stifling a gasp, Kyuubi firmly grasped on to Naruto's body stilling any motion. "Stop Naruto!" Naruto turned around facing Kyuubi.</p><p>"Why?" He asked as he starting rocking again except slightly harder into Kyuubi with a small smirk his blue eyes filled with mischief.</p><p>This time Kyuubi gasped out loud. His cock was now erect.</p><p>This was so wrong! Kyuubi wailed in his mind. Here he was getting erect for his little brother who he had admitted was rather delectable, but Naruto was his flesh and blood nonetheless. He was off limits territory, besides it was immoral, a sin. Then again when had he ever cared what was right or wrong before? This shouldn't be any different.</p><p>Naruto just continued, soon Kyuubi was returning the rocking of motion between them two..</p><p>The Redhead couldn't take it anymore. Fuck it being being immoral, He thought. Kyuubi reached for Naruto pulling him closer, finding his brothers' pouty pink lips, and kissing them fully. The Redhead moaning at the taste of his baby brother,it tasted like chocolate.</p><p>The two were still grinding against each other, Naruto responding quite eagerly wrapping his tan legs around his elder brother's waist. His arms snaking their way around Kyuu's neck.</p><p>Kissing back the youngest let out a whimper, "More Kyuu~" Kyuubi complied without a single thought.</p><p>Kyuu felt his little brother's lower region growing harder. Pulling back, Kyuu was slightly surprised at his little brother's cock size, but that was to be expected, after all Namikaze men were gifted.</p><p>Naruto interrupted Kyuubi's thoughts, pulling himself up to Kyuu's head; he initiated him into another kiss. They were locked in a fierce dual, but the eldest brother won taking control.</p><p>Everything was steadily growing hotter and hotter. Their bodies now were heated and both needed more contact. Kyuu peeled the shorts and shirt off of Naruto very slowly. Enjoying the site of his brother's skin. Pulling, his own shirt off he went back to pleasuring his brother.</p><p>Kyuu attacked the pink nipples of his Naruto, sucking against them. Naruto mewled slightly; Kyuu steadily went lower and lower sucking and biting everywhere he went enjoying sounds Naruto made.</p><p>Till he got to Naruto's groin area where Naruto's tuft of blonde hair was at the base of his cock. Wrapping his tongue around bringing him fully into his mouth.</p><p>The hot heat around Naruto's member was too much for him. He thrusted forward into the wet caravan, moaning and gasping pulling his brother's head closer to him. He couldn't stop even if he wanted too. Naruto felt like he was in heaven. "Kyuu, I-I-"</p><p>Kyuubi smirked against his brother. "Come (or cum?) for me Na-ru-to."</p><p>"Kyuu~" Naru said as he came into Kyuubi's mouth. White, hot, sticky semen flowed into Kyuubi's mouth; Kyuubi gulped all of it. His face spread into a devious grin.</p><p>Naruto's face was all flushed, his body sagging on to his brother. "I'm tired Kyuu."</p><p>The redhead's grin slowly melted down into a soft smile. Gently stroking his brother's soft blond hair, he picked him up walking upstairs toward his brother's room.</p><p>Briefly setting his Naruto down on his bed, Kyuubi walked toward his room to get one of his deep red t-shirts. Dressing his brother in a shirt, he made sure he was clean.</p><p>Once he was sure his brother was asleep, the redhead went down stairs throwing his brother's clothes and his shirt in the wash. When he was sure everything was the way it was before he sat down watching TV.</p><p>Several hours later Kushina and Minato came home to find their eldest on the couch. "So, how was Naruto? Did you two get along?" Kushina asked.</p><p>Kyuubi slowly smiled in a mischievous way, "Naruto is okay, he is sleeping actually. Yes, he and I actually got along very~ well." Kushina and Minato smiled at their eldest both happy to see their boys getting along, completely oblivious about Kyuubi's hidden meaning.</p><p>As they walked away, Minato chuckled, saying, "Maybe we should go out more." Kushina nodded her agreement. The pair didn't notice Kyuubi's smile changing into something more devious.</p><p>He hoped they started going out a lot more from now on. He wanted to spend more time with his precious Naru-chan.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p><b>Hello, first thing first. Thank You all who took a interest in my story, NamikazeCest.</b></p><p><b>I've decided to turn this into a fanfic. I hope you all enjoy it.</b></p><p><b>I own nothing.</b></p><p><b>FoxieFireFly came up with the game Sexy Truth or Dare, at least her version of it. In my story I will be using her game version, rules, and cards all that good stuff. ^.^ Go read her wonderful fanfictions. She is awesome!</b></p><p><b>Please Review.</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"... Mmmm...Ahh... Nnnn..."Kyuubi stroked his cock faster and faster until he came with a loud moan. Looking at his tanned hand covered in cum, he made a sound of annoyance. This had gone on far to long, a healthy boy like him could not satisfy his needs with just Mr. Leftie.</p><p>His parents were making it incredibly difficult to do anything with his younger brother Naruto besides steal a few heated kisses, but that wasn't nearly enough. He wanted to do so much more, his libido was practically begging for it.</p><p>Sighing at the thought, the redhead grabbed the orange hand towel hanging limply on his bedpost. His parents needed to go on vacation and leave Naruto and him alone for a couple of days, maybe a month or two.</p><p>That was just wishful thinking on his part, but still...to make it happen he needed a miracle. Again that was something that only happened in fairytales, he shouldn't get his hopes up.</p><p>Throwing the now dirtied towel in the hamper, Kyuu snuggled into the pillow eventually making the redhead fall asleep unaware that his sexual problems were about to disappear.</p><p><b><u>-Z-</u></b></p><p>Kyuubi walked downstairs all tired and groggy, making his toward the kitchen he wasn't at all surprised to see his family bustling about.</p><p>Sitting down at the table next to Naruto, his mother immediately placed pancakes and eggs with a side of bacon in front of the teen. Saying a small "Thank You". Kyuubi was about to dig in before his mother and father cleared their throats.</p><p>"Naruto, Kyuubi, your father and I have something to tell you." Kushina started.</p><p>"You father and I are leaving today for Venice, Italy after breakfast. I know it's kind of sudden, but we've wanted a second honeymoon, and we felt you guys were old enough to take of yourselves after we left you guys alone previous nights ago." Kushina finished, her nervous purple gaze directed at her sons.</p><p>Kushina hoped they wouldn't be mad at Minato and her. She also hoped that they didn't think she no longer wouldn't to take care of them any longer. Kushina would be lying if she said she didn't want this chance to relax with Minato, but more than anything this was a test of responsibility for her boys.</p><p>"How long are you guys going to be gone?" Naruto asked, his voice subdued.</p><p>This time Minato answered, "Two months at the longest, but we're leaving Kyuubi with our main credit card just in case something happens. While you were asleep your mother and I bought two months worth of food too.</p><p>Naruto didn't say anything although his blue eyes dimmed a bit.</p><p>Seeing his little brother distressed Kyuubi decided to add his input, "Don't worry Naru-chan, Mom and Dad will come back at a drop of a hat, plus I'll be here. You don't want my company?"</p><p>Kyuubi's normally slanted golden eyes grew wide and his bottom lip trembled as if he was going to cry. He was teasing but Naruto didn't need to know that. Naruto's blue eyes suddenly charged with life.</p><p>"No, I love Aniki's company!" Naruto practically shouted. Turning to face his older brother.</p><p>Kyuubi smiled in response, "Of Course you do!"</p><p>Meanwhile Kushina was happy, Naruto was okay with it but she took a glance at her wrist watch. Almost gasping at the time, she directed her boys' attention with a loud whistle.</p><p>"Prepare the GuestRooms, please." She said.</p><p>"Why, aren't you leaving us alone?" Kyuubi questioned.</p><p>Minato held in a laugh, while he watched his wife's face turn red clashing with her fiery red hair. He knew what was about to come.</p><p>"Your "aunt" Mikoto and "uncle" Fukagu will be with us on our second honeymoon. Both Itachi and Sasuke will be staying with you guys." Kushina replied hesitantly.</p><p>The Uchiha and Uzumaki-Namikaze kids never got along. Ever since the first meeting between the children, tensions just magically formed. They couldn't stand to be in the same room together.</p><p>Let's just say the first time Kyuubi and Itachi were in the same classes four kids got sent to the hospital and the other seventeen kids still piss their pants every night because of that horrible day.</p><p>It didn't help that Sasuke and Naruto had followed in their elder brother's steps.</p><p>Did I mention that both Itachi and Kyuubi were best friends and so were Naruto and Sasuke? Weird, right? I know.<b><br></b></p><p>It happened back when a group of people who shall not be named, coughkabutoandsoundfourcough, decided that it would be wise to bully Sasuke and Naruto. Needless to say they got their assess kicked. Nothing brings people together more than a good butt whoopin'.</p><p>Anyways no time for back story. Back to the main story sorry for the delay.</p><p>Twin shouts of "MOM!" came from the boys' mouth.</p><p>"I hate that stupid, teme!"</p><p>"That Uchiha is evil, he stole candy from a baby!"</p><p>The two brothers continued to rant about their respective rivals/best friends. Finally Kushina had enough, "QUIET! The Uchiha boys are staying here with you. If you don't treat them with respect, and I hear one thing from them..."</p><p>She raised her fist rather threateningly, "THERE. WILL. BE. CONSEQUENCES. Any questions?"</p><p>Kyuubi and Naruto stared at their mother in fear, both knew she would make due on her threat. Gulping the two momentarily looked at each before dashing upstairs to do what their mother told them.</p><p>Minato couldn't stop help it; he started to laugh like crazy. His wife turned back to him menacingly.</p><p>"What's so funny, honey? You need to do something too. Did you think I forgot that you needed to wax your back?"</p><p>Minato blanched.</p><p><b><u>Two hours later</u></b></p><p>The doorbell rung, and Kushina opened the door with a wide grin Immediately, she grabbed a dark haired woman into a fierce hug. "Mikoto, its been far to long."</p><p>The dark haired woman laughed in response hugging Kushina back just as hard. Meanwhile Itachi and Sasuke had made their way into the familiar house.</p><p>Kyuubi and Naruto were sitting on a blue couch, waiting. As soon as the Uchiha met their eyes a glaring contest began, and blue electricity crackled between them.</p><p>"Dobe."</p><p>"Teme."</p><p>"Weasel."</p><p>"Fox."</p><p>The tension grew between the foursome until their parents walked in, "We're leaving now!" Kushina said happily, not noticing the tension in the air.</p><p>"Give us hugs and kisses." She continued, effectively dispelling it. Giving one last glare to Sasuke and Itachi, both Naruto and Kyuubi walked into their mother's arms.</p><p>"I love you, Mom."</p><p>"See ya Ma, come back with a hot ass tan."</p><p>The redhead and the blond each saying in there own way that they were going to miss her.</p><p>Naruto leaned up to kiss his mother's left cheek and Kyuubi leaned down to kiss his mother's other. Kushina teared up a bit; pulling her children in a backbreaking hug she would miss her boys. "I love you, guys."</p><p>She managed to whisper.</p><p>She felt the reality drop in; she was really leaving her babies for two months. Kushina had never been away that long from her children, but it was time for them to grow up.</p><p>At least Kyuubi, Naruto was only ten, but still. They didn't need her that much anymore. Letting go, she wiped her eyes a bit. Minato gave a quick goodbye; he too didn't want to leave his children although he knew it was time.</p><p>With the goodbyes all done the four adults left and the foursome were left alone. Surprisingly as soon as they were gone Naruto literally jumped Kyuubi, tackling him to the ground.</p><p>Pulling him into a sweet kiss full of tongue, not caring if there was a rather stunned audience watching them. The two broke apart, looking at the Uchiha brothers.</p><p>Sasuke's face had pink dusting his cheeks while; Itachi just stared before his eyes flickered over to Sasuke a sort of longing in them. Acting like nothing had happened the two walked past them upstairs.</p><p>The latter had no choice, but to follow the two upstairs.</p><p>Sasuke and Itachi found the duo in the Kyuubi's room. Naruto sitting on his elder brother's lap, a two boxes in his arms.</p><p>"We are going play a game. Do you want to join? Be warned though, if you play this game, you couldn't back out." Naruto said, a hint of amusement in his voice.</p><p>"What game?" Itachi asked.</p><p>"Truth or dare just a different way to play." Kyuubi replied.</p><p>The Uchiha brothers shared a look. "Do you want to play Sasuke?" Itachi asked. Sasuke shrugged his shoulders, he didn't really care. This game would probably be boring, besides what could happen if he played?</p><p>"Sure." They replied in unison.</p><p>Naruto smiled getting off of Kyuubi's lap, closing the door behind the Uchihas. The blond sat in his former spot, beckoning the brothers closer toward him.</p><p>Laying the box on the floor he said, "The game that we are playing is called Sexy Truth Or Dare by FoxieFireFly's Company. A guaranteed hit at any party."</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p><b>Hi, I got two reviews! Party! Seriously, I'm smiling right now. Thank You, thank you.</b></p><p><b>Gracias to all those who alerted which I know is a lot.</b></p><p><b>I'm asking some of you to review, please. I need to know how I'm doing on lemons.</b></p><p><b>This is practice for my bigger story, 'Revised Help.'</b></p><p><b>I own nothing. </b></p><p><b><hr size=1 noshade>Sexy Truth or Dare Part 2 :</b></p><p>According to the rules the eldest always went first. Itachi was the oldest one out of all of them and currently he held a red and black card in his hand, his eyes scanning over each person in the crowd. <i>'Which person should I use this card on?'</i> Itachi thought.</p><p>The choice was a hard one. The card in his hand had so many possibilities, but what person would give him more entertainment. Hmm...Decisions...decisions... Itachi was about to voice the person he chose when Kyuubi interrupted him.</p><p>"Gods, Weasel choose someone already. You've been giving us creepy looks for like five minutes!"</p><p>Said mouth's person curved into a patent Uchiha Smirk. "Okay Fox. Truth or Dare?"</p><p>Kyuubi blinked for a few seconds before a foxy grin appeared on his face. "I got nothing to hide, truth." He exclaimed.</p><p><i>'Perfect.' </i> Itachi thought smugly. "What's the most explicit dream you've ever had involving a family member...or someone close to you?" He questioned.</p><p>The redhead in response grinned widely; showing off his unusually pointed canine teeth. "Are sure you want to know that?"</p><p>The eldest Uchiha nodded.</p><p>Shrugging, Kyuubi tightened his grip on Naruto, who still was comfortably sitting in his lap, "It happened two nights ago and it was about my delicious little brother right here." He went down to lick the shell of Naruto's ear making the blond shiver in delight. "Anyways...</p><p><b><i><u>'Kyuubi found himself in a partially dark room; he didn't know where he was. A breathy moan told him he wasn't alone. Walking toward the direction of the sound he found Naruto in his birthday suit tied up to his bedpost.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"Kyuu, I'm feeling hot. So hot, I want it to go away." His Naru said breathless as soon as he locked eyes upon his older brother.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>All Kyuubi was nod and stare, walking toward the bed. How did his brother end up like this? It didn't matter now, climbing on to the bed, he was even more surprised to see his little brother's eyes half-lidded, glazed over with lust plus his whole face lightly flushed.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Touching his brother arm gently who in turn gasped from the contact, attempted to get closer despite his restraints. "I need you, Kyuu."</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>The redhead stiffened at his brother's words. "Need me how..." He asked trying to look at anything, but his brother. Hopefully feigning ignorance would give him a better answer. The blond laughed, his voice taking a deeper tone. Not quite husky like a man's or as high-pitched as a child's.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"I think you know what I mean." He answered.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Kyuubi didn't know what to do. His brother was being all sexy like this. It was too good to be true, although if it was a dream he should enjoy to his fullest. It wasn't time for him to be so hesitant with things; he was named after the greatest demon lord in history.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>He should live up to the glory the name possessed. "I understand you, Naru." Kyuubi replied, moving on top of Naruto in a fluid motion, supporting his own weight.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Dipping low so he was at the shell of the blond's ear he whispered, "Do you really want me Naruto? Am I some cheap fuck? Do you want me to fill your tight ass with my cock, like no other can do? Do want big brother?"</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>While doing this a tanned hand crawled to Naruto's groin area. Stroking the growing length teasingly, "What do you say? Hmm.." He stroked slightly faster.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"Gods! Yes, I want yo-FUCK!" He exclaimed when Kyuubi unexpectedly squeezed. Chuckling almost maliciously while giving a smirk to match the redhead continued to squeeze, stroke, and tug aware of pre-cum that was coming of Naruto's slit. "Are you sure you want me?"</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"Gods, yes, Kyuubi. I want...you...ahh~...to fucking fuck me as...mmm...hard as you can. I want to...ngh...feel you. To fill me up to the brim with your cum. Please, Kyuu!"</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>The blond by now was panting heavily in pleasure. Letting go of Naruto's length, which the blond responded by whining at the lost of contact he quickly shushed him. First he untied Naruto's restraints than he undressed himself.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>As soon as Naruto could fully move again, he latched on to Kyuubi. Initiating his brother into a bruising kiss, where he nipped and tugged at his brother's bottom lip, asking for entrance. Kyuu smirked into the kiss, but he didn't open his mouth. Instead he pulled back holding up three tan fingers in front of his kitsune's face.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"Suck!" He commanded.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>A gleam made itself known in Naruto's eyes; guiding Kyuu's slim three fingers into his mouth he began his work. His tongue moved between each finger, nibbling on the flesh. Kyuubi's golden eyes were getting darker with arousal.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Giving one last long lick, Naruto pulled the redhead's fingers out of his mouth. Then spreading his legs, Kyuu slowly inserted one finger at time. Naruto squirmed a little at the contact. It was a bit painful, but he could take it. Kyuu meanwhile was scissoring his fingers around until he brushed against something.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>That something made Naruto moan loudly. Smirking, Kyuubi touched the spot again. The same results came. Without warning, Kyuu started to finger fuck his little brother, hitting to spot that made Naru see stars every time.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"Enough." Naruto managed to pant out.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"Put it in!"</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"With pleasure." Responded the redhead, removing his fingers; Kyuubi slowly inserted himself into his brother. His eyes practically rolling into the back of his head at the tightness, his brother possessed. It was mind blowing.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Naruto's body moved uncomfortably, his brother was much larger to than his fingers. Tears started to spring in his eyes, it hurt so badly. For a second he regretted the choice, but he saw so much love in Kyuubi's eyes that he couldn't bring himself to stop.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Kyuubi wanted to move so badly, but he could tell Naruto was not relaxed. He needed to relax unless this would be hurt him possibly scar him. After a couple of minutes, Kyuubi felt the muscles around his cock contract a bit signaling Naruto was relaxing.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"Move!" He croaked out, rocking his hips.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Kyuubi did so pulling back only to thrust back in. Naruto moaned loudly. Kyuu thrust back in wildly, enjoying the looks of pleasures that were etched on his little brother's face. The blond tried to get in rhythm with Kyuubi, but he couldn't. He only met some of the thrusts...</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Wrapping his legs around Kyuu's waist, bringing the redhead closer to him. He grunted as Kyuu hit his spot dead on, "Harder... FUCK...faster...nghn...Kyuu!" The redhead did so easily, snaking a free hand around Naruto's shaft, he started to jerk him off.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Naruto meanwhile could barely hear himself, it was a mixture between him moaning, shrieking along with his brother's own sounds in there too, plus tan skin slapping against lighter tanned skin. When his brother touched him too, Gods, he was so close...</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Kyuubi loved this so much; he never ever wanted this kind of thing to stop. Gods, Naruto was so fucking hot. Shit, the heat was incredible, but he felt himself getting close. Pulling out all the way one last time only to completely thrust back in with extra vigor, he hit Naruto's prostate.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>"FUCK!" The simultaneous cries came from both persons.</u></i></b></p><p><b><i><u>Naruto saw white, and a silent scream it least to his ears came from his mouth. Warm rather thick semen spurted out from the blond's cock, creating a large mess. Kyuu came into Naruto's ass, golden eyes rolled to the back of his head.</u></i></b></p><p>Then it ended." Kyuubi finished. By now both Uchiha's were blushing madly looking at anyone, but each other. "I believe it's my turn now." The redhead said with a smirk.</p><p>"You didn't have go into so much detail." Sasuke mumbled to himself snidely.</p><p>Kyuubi shrugged, "If its anyone fault, blame your brother." Taking a black and red card, he knew to just to whom to ask for his particular question.</p><p>Although before he spoke, he whispered so only his cute Kitsune on his lap and him could hear. "I love you, Naruto."</p><p>Naruto looked up, staring into golden eyes, "I love you too, Kyuubi." He replied, before pecking his brother on the lips.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Hope you enjoyed. Point any mistakes, please.</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p><b>Ello my peeps! ^.^</b></p><p><b>Yes, yes, yes, I am back finally. So sorry for that but Like every writer a stupid writer's block decided to interfere. I'm not like other writers so a lot of times when I do write out a couple of chapters I end up changing them.</b></p><p><b>Its very weird. Planning out really doesn't work for me. My writing flows from whatever is one my mind at the moment the brilliant idea strikes.</b></p><p><b>I would like to thank all my reviewers especially <i><u>Makedi</u></i></b>. <b>Thank you for the idea, this chapter is dedicated to you. I hope you like it. Let's see what else...</b></p><p><b>I own nothin, absolutely nada.</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>NamikazeCest</b></p><p><b>Chapter Four</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Just before Kyuubi was about to call out his dare to who ever he picked a loud growl filled the room. Surprisingly it wasn't Naruto or Kyuubi. It definitely wasn't Itachi so that only left a single Uchiha. Said Uchiha was currently trying to pretend like nothing had happened.</p><p>"What!" He exclaimed, "Read the card!" Kyuubi didn't budge in the matter instead he leaned down to whisper in Naruto's ear. The little blond nodded an affirmative before grabbing Sasuke by the wrist pulling him out of the room to his.</p><p>It was still decorated with an orange and blue theme with various posters decorating the wall. The giant poster of a ramen cup still hung haphazardly over Naruto's unmade bed. Papers were strewn around on desks and drawers while toys and books along with some clothes were all over the floor covering the deep blue carpet underneath.</p><p>Different pictures from past occasions depicting of him, Itachi, Kyuubi, and Naruto himself on the closest dresser to his bed. Bounding on to his bed before sitting down Naruto swung his legs over the end.</p><p>Crossing his arms, Sasuke leaned on the orange colored wall. "Your room is messy as ever and loud too."</p><p>"Whatever bastard. It least my room isn't dark and emo like yours with no personality. What person has a cemetery as a poster or a skull?</p><p>"Hn, why are we in here anyway? I thought we were playing a game."</p><p>"We're going out because you're hungry and Mom and Dad forgot that we have zero cooking skills. Enough about that though, where are your clothes?</p><p>"In my room, dumbass."</p><p>"Why the fuck are they in there? Go get them, and you say I'm the idiot."</p><p>"That would be because you are one." Sasuke responded with a slight smile heading out of the room to get his suitcases. Coming back in a couple of minutes, Naruto shut the door locking it.</p><p>Opening Sasuke's suitcase he went through piles and piles of his clothes before stopping with a frown. "Teme, where are your girl clothes?"</p><p>"Naruto you do realize we are boys right? We have dicks. We are B-O-Y-S!" Sasuke said staring at Naruto oddly. The blond only sighed loudly.</p><p>"For today you're going to borrow my awesome array of clothes. Later we're getting your own."</p><p>"Naruto, did you hear anything I said not even a minute ago?" Sasuke asked watching Naruto go through his closet occasionally muttering. Throwing a dark orange skirt with a fox at the hem, white leggings and a black T-shirt with a random band logo on the bed. Giving Sasuke a once over, he gave an excited noise.</p><p>"Teme, your legs better be shaved." Naruto said before pulling out a short black dress. A black belt with white spikes went around the midsection while white skulls decorated the bottom half of the dress that fanned out. The top was a pure black and even came with a little jacket.</p><p>"Naruto why do you have that in there?" The blond shrugged muttering something about his mother wanting a girl, secretly dressing him up and taking him shopping.</p><p>Weird.</p><p>"This is the perfect outfit. You will wear it with pride." Naruto said throwing it to Sasuke. "You can wear those black ankle length converse with it."</p><p>Stripping off his clothes, Naruto rushed into the shower. Taking about five minutes Naruto came back out with his outfit on. Putting on his neon orange shoes on, he was ready but he saw Sasuke still holding his dress.</p><p>"Sasuke! What are you doing? Hurry up get in the shower." Sasuke ignored Naruto. "Teme?"</p><p>Sasuke laid the dress on the bed. The littlest Uchiha was acting so non-Uchiha like. Naruto worried about his friend's health, feeling his forehead he was about to call his older brother. "Hang on, I'll get Kyuubi and Itachi." About to rush to the door, Sasuke grabbed his wrist.</p><p>"Dobe, I'm fine... I just wonder how Itachi will think I look." A hint of red showed on his cheeks. Naruto smiled leaning in.</p><p>"Awww, Sasu-chan has a crush on Itachi?" Naruto smirked, watching Sasuke as he tried to hide his blush. "We'll I'm sorry to say this but he already likes someone..." Naruto trailed off.</p><p>Before he knew the blond was on the ground with Sasuke on top of him. "Who is it? Is it your cousin Deidara or that freaky fish dude maybe some other bitch?" Sasuke spoke rapidly; his eyes had highlights of red.</p><p>"Well it's not any of those people, you brother told me who he likes…" Naruto shrugged nonchalantly trying to hold in his snickers. Sasuke however did not think this was a funny matter. His aniki, his older brother, his comfort object whenever Father wasn't especially kind to him was crushing on someone. That someone could take the comfort his brother provided for him away, Itachi would forget him. After all he would only ever be Itachi's foolish little brother.</p><p>Leaning in till he was nose to nose with the blond, he growled, "Who does Aniki like so I can gut them like a fish?" Naruto couldn't take it anymore; he shook off Sasuke starting to laugh as soon as he sat up. Sasuke frowned but waited till his best friend was done laughing at his love life.</p><p>Wiping a few stray tears away, Naruto's laughs turned into giggles and then he was done. "Are you done, idiot?" Naruto nodded a happy grin on his face.</p><p>"You call me all stupid, teme but the person that your dear older brother likes is…drum roll please." Sasuke narrowed his punching Naruto in the arm.</p><p>"No more interruptions." He resisted the urge to laugh as he watched Naruto rub his arm mumbling about evil sadistic bastards that are abusive to their BFFs.</p><p>"Sasuke Uchiha, Itachi Uchiha, the weirdest weasel alive with some very bad social problems. I mean he's like so anti-social, I heard Aunt Miko tell Mom that one-day. He also has this weird pocky obsession; it makes me wonder if he has a secret stash somewhere. I almost always see him with a pack on him. Although I didn't see one today, that's odd. I should ask him about that. Furthermore he looks like a girl from the back, and he always seems to be glaring. It's a wonder why you like someone like him."</p><p>"Naruto." Sasuke held up a fist.</p><p>"The person Itachi likes is you, you dobe!" Naruto said scratching the back of his blond head while grinning wildly. "Haven't you noticed all those looks he gives you and the abnormal hate he holds for Sakura and Ino?</p><p>He practically made them piss their pants that time; they walked you home holding your hands. When Itachi opened the door, I swear he had an evil aura behind him with devilish laughter emitting from behind him. Now either that day I had too much sugar or you brother is secretly the devil with really bad jealousy problems. It could be both. Also, what about the time I wanted to seesaw with you at five?</p><p>At twelve your brother pushed me, an innocent five year out of the way claiming that I can't seesaw correctly." Naruto continued to ramble while getting up off the ground and straightening out his clothes.</p><p>Sasuke who was rather surprised sat there on the ground in shock. Itachi was crushing on him, the hottest boy in high school or so he had been told liked him. Smiling deviously, Sasuke headed to the bathroom to change.</p><p>At eleven, I look so much better than those bitches. Sasuke thought as he eyed himself in the mirror. Remembering all those girls who tried and failed in getting Itachi's attention with skimpy outfits and such. Walking out of the restroom, Naruto gave him a spiked chocker, himself wearing a couple of gel bracelets on his wrist and pins in his hair adding to the illusion of him being a girl.</p><p>Putting on the final accessories, Sasuke and Naruto inspected at each for any imperfections. When they were done, Naruto unlocked the door. Giving a quick speech about how irresistible they looked he walked out of the door with Sasuke in tow.</p><p>Taking out his cellphone, Naruto scrolled down till he got to Kyuubi's number. <i><u>'Kyuu, I need u to help me with a plan.'</u></i></p><p><i><u>'Sure what is it?'</u></i></p><p><i><u>'Teme likes Weasel he just doesn't know to tell him.'</u></i></p><p><i><u>'So…'</u></i></p><p><i><u>'We need Dei and Sori to make you guys jealous.'</u></i></p><p><i><u>'How Jealous?'</u></i></p><p><i><u>' Just enough for Weasel to act meaning i want him 2 see red.'</u></i></p><p><i><u>'He's gonna kill them.'</u></i></p><p><i><u>'I '</u></i></p><p><i><u>' Fine, I'll play along. But you owe me. Love u Naru-chan! ;p</u></i></p><p><i><u>'Luv ya 2.'</u></i></p><p>Turning to Sasuke briefly who was picking at the hem of his dress. "We need to call Sasori and Deidara. You call Deidara and I'll handle Sasori."</p><p>A black eyebrow raised, Naruto just smiled. "We are going make Itachi want you but to do that we're going make him jealous."</p><p>"Jealous?" Sasuke was a bit unsure about that. He had never seen Itachi show much emotion expect when he was around the Akatsuki and Kyuubi. However whenever around them he had never once showed any traits of jealously. So to see him be jealous would be surprising to see the least.</p><p>"Yep, now call!" Naruto said, pressing the call button for Sasori. Sasuke mirrored Naruto calling the blond's cousin.</p><p>"Naruto?" A teenage voice sounded through the other line.</p><p>"Hey Sasori, I need a favor."</p><p>"I need you to play a part in my awesome plan called Operation Green Weasel!"</p><p>"Why, should I?"</p><p>"Because if you don't I'll tell everyone about your Hello Kitty Obsession."</p><p>"You wouldn't!" The redhead on the other line challenged, his voice clearly cracking at the end of his sentence. A foxy grin appeared on Naruto's face. He didn't grow up with Kyuubi and learn nothing about the awesome art of blackmailing.</p><p>I would, Sasuke is already is talking with Deidara right now. If you don't participate then I will tell Sasuke to tell Dei everything." The blond was satisfied to hear a pronounced gulp.</p><p>"Meet me at Dave and Busters in an hour or so. Pay for lots of tickets and stuff. By the way make sure you are ready to run for your lives. You know how our brothers get."</p><p>"Naru-"</p><p>"Bye!" Ending the call, Naruto put his phone in his back skirt pocket. Sasuke appeared to be done too, before heading to the living room where their older brothers were he pulled Sasuke aside. "Act cool, teme. Don't have that constipated look on your face."</p><p>Electric Blue eyes lighting up, Naruto put his hands on his hips. "Act like the Sasuke I know with a fifty foot stick up his ass." Sasuke couldn't help but smile at that one. He was Sasuke Uchiha, the Ice Prince of the Leaf. He could make person girl or guy fall for him with one glance in their direction. How that anything to do with the situation at hand he didn't know but it made him feel a lot better.</p><p>"We are getting your Weasel tonight." Like many times in his life, Sasuke believed and trusted what Naruto said.</p>
