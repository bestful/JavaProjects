I'm sorry for all of you who waited in vainâ€¦ I just wasn't getting any feedback, and it made me sad. But all that aside, I rediscovered the story when I was cycling through my email accounts. So, without any further ado, I will attempt to pick up the story.</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Amida rested against the headboard of his intricately carved bed holding his much loved mate in his arms. For the past five years, they had lived very much undisturbed in the mountains of the fire country. All seemed to be going well and nothing endangered the balance of nature. Love and prosperity ushered forth a new era of long-lasting peace. The five major villages had reached an alliance with one another and created a continent spanning League of Nations. All was quiet in the physical world and in the demon realms. A new age of science and reason was sweeping through the land as new infrastructure and technology made communication more efficient. All was swell.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Konoha-early morning:</p><p>Naruto and Tsunade were chatting in the hokage office. Tsunade's health had taken a turn for the worse. Years of alcohol had destroyed the aging woman's liver, leaving her prone to illness and fatigue. Despite her failing health, much of the village had taken a swing for the better. All of the village elders had died or retired except Danzo, who stayed to 'keep an eye on the demon child'. Truth be told, Naruto was no longer a child, but a strong young man. His skills in the battlefield quickly outshone his sensei and eclipsed that of the hokage. The villagers had grown to love him after the extraction ceremony.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama, are you sure you're alright?" Naruto asked concernedly as the hokage doubled over from a cough.</p><p>"I'm," cough, "fine," Tsunade wheezed. Something must be going on, Tsunade thought; this illness is spreading like nothing before. She did a quick chakra test on herself, and instantly started coughing up blood. The second she stopped applying chakra, the burning sensation stopping. "Naruto, get Shizune, emergency, no chakra," Tsunade said as she passed out on her desk.</p><p>Hearing a loud thud, Shizune entered the room without needing Naruto's signal. "What happened?" she asked as she approached the hokage gathering healing chakra in her hand.</p><p>"Stop!" Naruto shouted. Shizune stopped. "She collapsed the moment she applied chakra. It must be a chakra activated poison. Get help immediately!" Shizune stopped to get a blood sample before whisking away to the chem. labs. Naruto picked up the hokage and brought her to the hospital before anything else happened.</p><p>Word spread around the villages. The Hokage had been poisoned.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>I know, very short introduction. But I'm getting there. I still have to study for a physics test tomorrow, and I wanted to get this ball rolling.</b></p><p><b>Review and tell me what you think where this is going. It'll be good. I promise! 3</b></p>
