Yes, I've an obsession with redheads (which you'll definitely notice if you keep reading my works), but I don't care what you think about that.</p><p>I've always preferred the "darker" fanfictions with Naruto going mad (or not) on the path of redemption (or leaving Konoha), owning his beloved one(s), make things go BOOM and stuff like that, but as in the real life there is always the need to be reminded of the things that could go really wrong and change your life and your sight on the world forever. Showing a way only few dared to write about, within this piece of literature, you'll possibly discover the very bottom of the (human) soul itself.</p><p><i><b>Edit: </b></i>I've increased the number paragraphs for you. I don't know whether reading is better for you now or not, I have no problems with both of them, even if writing the new one was a little bit odd. Think of it as an experiment, because 'in the old days' I've always written in a more compact form. Please tell me what you think of it.</p><p><b><i>Edit:</i></b> Now continued!</p><p><b>Warning for this chapter only:</b> Contains a female Kyuubi and a bucket load of angst and drama, love itself will only play a minor role. Rape will get a mention, cutting will be described and suicide will be committed. Even if I tried to play the scenes down I REALLY would consider this M material, so only if you deem yourself capable of handling it, and only then, you should read.</p><p>"…Talking…" <b>"…Demon Talking…"</b><br><i>…Thinking… </i><i><b>…Demon Thinking…</b></i><br>~~Timeskip/Flashback~~<br>-Change of Location-</p><p><i>"The person without a purpose is like a ship without a rudder."</i><i> —Thomas Carlyle</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Purpose</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>A blonde, spiky haired young man walked down the main route of Konoha, ignoring the glares full of hate and disgust which were thrown at him while he showed the world his trademark foxy grin. To be exact, he didn't even realize that people glared at him.</p><p>But who was this teenager, to ignore something so obvious? If his identity wasn't shown by his facial features, blue eyes and three whisker marks on each of his cheeks, then at latest with the jumpsuit in orange and black it was obvious. The apparently 15-years old boy was no one else than the jinchuuriki of the Kyuubi no Yoko, Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze or as the villagers loved to put it, the 'Demon Brat'.</p><p>But, unknown to every living being of this world beside the boy and his tenant, what they saw was nothing more than a mere mask. To put it exactly, not even these two know who he really was. He, because he wasn't even giving a damn in the world about himself and she, because her host was nothing more than an enigma for her, something that worried her greatly, made her feel guilty and even infuriated her. Why?</p><p>Because Kyuubi was the one being that… created the thing that was behind the idiotic mask the people believed to be Naruto. But what happened, that it had come to this?</p><p>To comprehend the complexity of the whole situation, we need to go back fifteen years in time, to the day where the Kyuubi attacked Konoha under the influence of Madara Uchiha, after the Uchiha freed the beast from the seal of his former host and was finally sealed within the son of Minato Namikaze und Kushina Uzumaki.</p><p>However, during the sealing the Yondaime made a grave mistake.</p><p>Because of unknown reasons he tried to tamper in his final moments with the seal the death god had brought into existence. Whatever his intentions may have been, he ended with granting the vixen the possibility to directly influence the newborn, even speak to Naruto at will, something he would most likely not wanted to achieve.</p><p>The Kyuubi was aware that tampering with the seal of a god could have various, mostly bad, outcomes so she secretly started to make her ultimate escape plan. Knowing what would happen to the boy, not that she cared, she would only need an old technique of hers, a little bit of youki and patience.</p><p>She would get her revenge by making the son of the man that sealed her into him a servant and letting him free her. It was plain and simple, what should go wrong?</p><p>The blonde baby never had the chance to know about this and with his very first breathings as the new jinchuuriki the vixen within him set her plan into motion. From this moment on, he would feel and see things no being should ever discover and even sleep would become his own hell.</p><p>No one cared that he was just an innocent baby.</p><p>While Naruto walked to training ground 44, known as the 'Forest of Death', the single Anbu guarding him wondered what he was up to. But because of his hate towards the demon he doesn't really cared about the blonde and, seeing him enter the forest, decided to take the rest of the day off. After all, it wasn't his problem when the brat died, just because he wanted to train. Leaving the demon to whatever he was up to, the Anbu stopped and turned homewards.</p><p>Sighing in relief as the Uzumaki recognized that the Anbu had finally stopped tailing him, he wondered whether he had all materials he needed to fulfill his purpose; freeing the Kyuubi from the human prison she was forced into.</p><p>The one he considered superior to him and who was no one else than his mistress was on the other hand feeling guilt and even fear like she had never felt before, not even as the death god ripped her soul from her body.</p><p>She remembered everything that had happened, everything the boy was forced to endure, from her hands and the hands of all the villagers. For the first time in her existence she truly felt regret related to her own actions.</p><p>~~Flashback, 15 years ago, 2 weeks after the Kyuubi attack~~</p><p>With a feeling of sick satisfaction the principal of the orphanage watched the little blonde baby suffer. The demon, even if she knows the real name of the bastard she would never step so low and call <i>it</i> by it, this was a part of her revenge after all, whimpered softly, almost inaudible.</p><p>When the Hokage wouldn't have been interested in the child as a weapon for the village she would have probably killed the thing to avenge her twins that died two weeks ago as they had been buried by their through the strike of a tail destroyed house. So she settled for revenge, after her husband, who was a shinobi, explained it to her. And, in her opinion, a weapon shouldn't need any more than its existence itself.</p><p>Carrying out her revenge she watched how the little baby struggled against the cold and darkness that was in its room, armed with nothing more than a very thin and tattered blanket. Knowing that the demon would unfortunately most likely prevent itself from becoming sick, she was forced to leave it at that and of course, cutting his rations to a point where it was almost impossible to survive.</p><p>But in the end, even if this thing should become a weapon, in her opinion its dead would do them all a greater good. Who knows whether it would try to destroy the village again?</p><p>Satisfied for the moment the woman left and leaved the demon child behind. She was proud of herself for her harsh treatment and her resistance against the demon trying to lull her into believing it was indeed just a child. However, if she had known what the kid was forced to endure mentally, she would have wanted to die.</p><p>In his mindscape, unknown to the boy of course, Kyuubi stared with her red eyes, which were colder than ice itself, at her host without even the slightest hint of pity or humanity. All she cared for was how to force this pathetic young boy into growing up and fulfilling her escape plan.</p><p>Seeing that the kid again tried to crawl to her, because she was the only other living being in the mindscape and emitted the warmth the boy craved, the vixen only shoved it in disgust further into the depths of the place that represented the mind of her host.</p><p>Not even caring about the effect it would have on the in the wet and dark sewer-like room whimpering baby's mind, she continued the actions she had done every time the son of the man she hated possibly the most directly after Madara, had fallen asleep and forced her chakra to surround him, not even caring about his loud cries telling of the pain he felt, by being burned and poisoned simultaneously because of the aggressive nature of the red energy and as she deemed it enough chakra for her next action, she exclaimed the name of an old and forbidden technique. <b>"Soul Breaker."</b></p><p>Again she forced the mind of the kid to see a part of her memories, of course only the most sickening, bloodiest and most painful memories that she had endured or received via jutsu.</p><p>Being even capable of interacting with the dream it was possible for her to let the blonde feel the pain the killed ones had felt, let him kill all of them, or even be killed in ways that weren't even known to the mind of the most insane human.</p><p>After all, it takes eons of experience to come up with the things Kyuubi flung at her host and to think that this was only the beginning…</p><p>~~Flashback End~~</p><p>Reviewing the things she had done, the demoness wanted nothing more than to puke. Now that she was capable of thinking rational and being not longer blinded by her unholy fury she even shed a single tear of sadness for the thing she had created.</p><p>But she wasn't the only one to blame, things have had happened that she found at first good because they only helped her in completing her mission, but now she found them downright disgusting.</p><p>After all, who would do something like <i>that</i>?</p><p>~~Flashback, 11 years ago, 10th October~~</p><p>Being kicked out of the orphanage not long ago, Naruto still tried to find a place where he could hide. Hide himself from the, at least for him because of unknown reasons, wrath of the villagers and to find a way to escape the <i>things</i> he was forced to experience every time he tried to sleep.</p><p>Deep within him he was aware of the fact, that there was no possibility to run from either of them. He wasn't capable to stop sleeping, he had tried and failed after nearly eighty hours and what he had endured after that wasn't describable by words.</p><p>The pain had become his permanent companion, with every single second his heart made a beat he felt nothing more than pure agony. The blonde was sure that no human would feel like this, maybe, after all, he was truly a demon like everyone he ever met had always said.</p><p>If that was true, then why was he alive? What was the reason of his existence?</p><p>But not only pain followed him, the darkness had become somewhat like a soothing aid, whenever it was dark he wouldn't be hated like the times when it was bright and, on top of that, beside the void within himself, he always felt the biting cold, even under the rays of a summer sun.</p><p>Moving his undernourished, skinny body in a stumbling fashion through the alleys of the place where he was born he wasn't really aware of his surroundings. Naruto noticed the three men in front of him at first as he walked straight into one of them, only to be met with the bone crushing hit of a fist.</p><p>"You demon! How dare you try to injure me!", the man the blonde had walked into yelled, raising his fist once again.</p><p>What followed was the first beating the Uzumaki had to endure in his life. Growing tired of breaking bones and beating the kid to a pulp after nearly two hours only one man was left. As soon as he pulled back a dirty and sick look appeared in his eyes. Naruto didn't know what awaited him as his already torn and blood stained clothes were ripped from his small body.</p><p>Kyuubi on the other hand chuckled darkly as she realized what this pathetic human fool was up to as she watched everything through the eyes of her host before retreating back into her cage, at least for now.</p><p>She would have her own 'playtime' soon enough, in a sick way the vixen enjoyed torturing the blonde, especially since he started to look more and more like his damned father, most likely she would play this scene for him over and over again.</p><p>Deciding that he was still too immature she decided to not reveal herself now.</p><p>With that, the hell the boy's life had always been was taken to a new level. Not only was his mind shattered beyond belief, now his body would become broken to.</p><p>~~Flashback End~~</p><p>Shudder above shudder crawled down her spine. How sick and cruel had she been to actually enjoy all of this? What madness had took hold of her that she had allowed these things to happen?</p><p>She was ashamed of herself to no end. If it was possible Kyuubi would have hide under a rock and died because of guilt. But there was still a glimpse of hope, so the redhead couldn't just do that, besides she still had plans, even if they had changed drastically compared to those she had fifteen years ago.</p><p>Finally she had discovered the worth Naruto really represented. A man, strong enough to stand up to her, caring and kind enough to always care for her, someone she could consider a mate. But she herself had destroyed this possibility only ten years ago… oh how she cursed herself for that.</p><p>~~Flashback, 10 years ago, 10th October~~</p><p>For the first time in his entire life the Uzumaki thought about suicide. He just couldn't bear it anymore and wished for all the pain, fear, hate and disgust to just end, vanish to never ever return again.</p><p>He had lost his sense for time and wasn't even aware of his surroundings. His existence was pain, nothing more.</p><p>So as he finally regained his senses a bit and heard the quiet dripping sound of water, he slowly opened his eyes and groaned.</p><p><i>Where am I?</i>, he questioned, even if his eyes sight was still blurry it seems as if he was in a sewer, the water he was in was an additional indication, but not in that of Konoha, some villagers had once thrown him into it so he could say he was definitely not there. Maybe he was in a part he hadn't discovered back then? His thoughts were disrupted by a lout booming voice that came seemingly out of nowhere.</p><p>"<b>If you don't turn around now you pathetic little human, I'll tear you apart."</b>, the disembodied voice nearly roared and, no one to provoke a beating, the blonde turned, despite his condition, around immediately.</p><p>He came face to face, or in this special case face to snot, with a giant red being that was caged behind mighty golden bars which were, oddly enough, only locked by a tiny little paper with an even odder kanji on it. The situation would have been funny, but the nearly grey eyes of Naruto und his emotionless expression on the one side and the rage of Kyuubi on the other side wasn't something to be laughed at.</p><p>"<b>So you've finally come, it took you long enough human."</b>, she spat.</p><p>"Who are you and where are we?", the Uzumaki inquired, whatever or whoever this was and even if it killed him, death itself had lost its horror for the young boy.</p><p><i><b>This is so perfect.</b></i>, Kyuubi thought as her mind registered every little bit of information the blonde unknowingly showed her.</p><p>"<b>Silence mortal, you speak only when I order you to. Be glad, I'm in a good mood today and I'll answer your questions. We are in your mind, your subconscious to be exact, but the reason for us being here I'll not explain now. I'm no one else than the famous Kyuubi no Kitsune, the nine-tailed fox. You should be ashamed of yourself that you didn't know my name the moment you laid your eyes upon me."</b>, she informed him and, knowing what storm would break out in his stupid little mind, she awaited the outcome of this situation.</p><p>It took little Naruto several minutes to comprehend the situation he was in but he ultimately failed, because his education was less than poor.</p><p>Slowly he sat down on the wet ground, eyeing the fox in front of him. He tried to speak several times, but before a word could leave his mouth he closed it again. Gathering his composure he asked the one question he always wanted to find the answer to.</p><p>"If you are so mighty as you say are, could you tell me then why I'm alive?"</p><p><i><b>Oh yes!</b></i>, she rejoiced at his answer.</p><p>"<b>You want to know your purpose?"</b>, she inquired to be exactly sure, Kyuubi couldn't allow herself to make a mistake now or her whole plan was worthless. As the blonde in front of her nodded, she could only grin in a feral fashion.</p><p><i><b>Thank you very much you stupid and pathetic idiots of Konoha!</b></i>, she could nearly throw a party in her head, the chance to be free again and accomplishing her revenge was handed to her on a silver platter!</p><p>"<b>Very well then. As you said I am powerful, god-like to be exact. You see that because of that I'm superior to you and every other mortal existence. However, you're here for a reason, your existence is because you have to fulfill a mission. Your purpose is to free me, destroy the prison I'm forced into. You, Naruto Uzumaki, are my servant, not more and not less. You'll listen to me and no one else and obey to everything I say without questioning my motives or intentions. I hope for you that this is understood."</b>, Kyuubi declared and sealed with these words the fate of her jinchuuriki.</p><p>~~Flashback End~~</p><p>She made no outward sign as she felt the back of her eyeballs begin to sting again. What she had done wasn't describable. Kyuubi had practically completely shattered him, especially his mind and formed him in a way were he would fulfill his mission without further doubt or complications.</p><p>She had spent a lot of time to educate him, back then she couldn't stand his stupidity. She had forced the orange jumpsuit, the abuse of ramen as meal and the idiotic act upon him, this condemning him to a life as lonely pariah of the village. Nearly every step he set and word he said had come from her - his personality was forced in a corner of his mind and left to rot.</p><p>The redhead had done nearly everything she could think of to gain indirectly revenge against the Yondaime and her former host, his wife.</p><p>She trained him under circumstances no human, a child nonetheless could hope to survive - but she didn't care and if it wasn't for the blondes Uzumaki lineage he would have most likely succumbed to the eternal darkness. The price was high, but at the age of twelve he was nearly on par with the Sannin - now, three years later, he could possibly take on the Hokage, even if it was only Tsunade.</p><p>But for what she could really strangle herself - she forced him to give up all of his emotions, so that he would never be distracted and could become her ultimate and perfect tool. Everything he showed others were roles he learned, the blonde understood the concept of emotions but wasn't capable of feeling them.</p><p>Kyuubi wept. She had made him a cold and soulless puppet, never cared for him - and as she oddly enough started to fall for him two years ago it was already too late to change it. The seed she had planted had grown and grown within Naruto and now there was nothing that could stop him anymore.</p><p>But in her opinion that wasn't even the worst…</p><p>~~Flashback, 7 years ago~~</p><p>Thunder rolled through Konoha, accompanied by a heavy rainfall. The Uzumaki was now eight years old but he looked three years older. But to not blow the cover Kyuubi had decided to use a strong Henge on the blonde, powered by her youki. The use pained Naruto but she didn't care.</p><p>The Uzumaki sat silently on his bed, his eyes half lidded.</p><p>With every lightning something sparkled in his grasp. He slowly raised his right hand which clasped the kunai hard.</p><p>It was wrong, he knew that, but he kept doing that over and over again because of a simple reason - it was his only possibility to bear the pain, the hate, everything the world threw at him. Every time the cold metal cut through his skin like a hot knife through butter and the crimson liquid stained his sheets everything became meaningless and he felt what he desired - silence and peace deep within himself.</p><p>His body was full of scars - his mistress never cared enough to let them vanish when he lived most of the day under a Henge.</p><p>With a slow motion the kunai cut through the surface of his left arm, again and again, reopening old or nearly healed scars.</p><p>Naruto felt his consciousness fade, but he wasn't finished now… there was more of his body to threat, to ultimately reach the bliss of peace on the verge of death when everything became unimportant…</p><p>~~Flashback End~~</p><p>Just a little bit more and she would curl into a ball. Her actions were unforgivable.</p><p>She couldn't deny that she long ago had started to take a liking towards him which developed oddly enough slowly into love, even if it was because of wrong reasons.</p><p>Naruto was strong and smart, perfect basic traits for a perfect mate, he was honorable and kind, traits that belonged to him since birth and ultimately, he cared for her, even if it was under the force of his role as servant he had gone to lengths she only became aware of later, as her blind rage started to subside. That had been most likely remnants of his personality.</p><p>Was it really too late? Nothing that could be done anymore?</p><p>Kyuubi would not accept this and so she called the blonde. The Uzumaki was a treasure she must protect and claim as hers. There was no way she would let him fulfill his plan if it meant his death.</p><p>She started to remind the day where she had revealed to him that she was in fact female, but she was brought out of her musings as she heard footsteps approaching her. Time to claim and free her favorite human.</p><p>Even if her love was maybe born out of guilt, she couldn't stand seeing his suffering anymore.</p><p>Walking to her with his head lowered was said blonde. He didn't dare to look his mistress in the eyes. Coming to a halt at the line between the old sewer like part of the room and her to a throne room changed cage, the place where once the original seal now turned line had been, he got down on all four, pressed his forehead against the wet floor and bowed.</p><p>"What is it that you wish mistress?", he asked from his awkward position on the rock hard ground. One final calming breath and the redhead started to speak.</p><p>"<b>Please rise and look at me Naruto, there is no need for this formal behavior right now."</b><br>Following his mistress order he did exactly that.</p><p>"<b>I've called you here because I wish you to stop your task immediately."</b>, Kyuubi stated and awkward silence followed.</p><p>"But why should you want that?", the blonde asked confused, what had happened that he hadn't noticed? The redhead decided to tell him the truth.</p><p>"<b>I guess you remember the night two years ago where I told you truth about me? This was the first time I realized that I'd taken a liking to you. As weeks and months passed by I finally understand that I'd started to… love you. Please stop it Naru-kun, I don't want to see you suffer anymore! I would gladly stay within you if it ensures your safety!"</b>, she nearly cried.</p><p>What came next shocked her to the core.</p><p>"This is impossible.", the Uzumaki answered, but Kyuubi couldn't even gasp before he continued talking.</p><p>"I'm only a clone but my boss sends me here because he suspected that something was troubling you. He said I should explain everything to you, while he's finishing his preparations. As well I'm here to prevent you from interfering. My boss knows you desire freedom and revenge above all else - he couldn't let emotions he isn't capable of feeling stop him. He also gave me a message for you.", the shadow clone reported, made for the first time during his declaration a break and cleared his throat.</p><p>Kyuubi never get a chance to talk.</p><p>"I feared something would let you change your mind, mistress. You've acted odd over the last few weeks and I prepared myself for the worst. Even if you should love me, it wouldn't be possible for me to stop. You should remind yourself that you are god-like and I'm only a mere human. A relationship other than me being your servant would be highly inappropriate. But there's something else you must consider. Living without a true purpose I tried to find one, make one but finally realized that it was bound to fail. Then you appeared and gave my life a meaning, now my existence was finally worth something. For that I'm eternally grateful and there's nothing more that I wish than to see you happy, freed from the human prison the Yondaime once forced you into. Farewell my mistress.", the clone said and as he faded from existence there was silence, only broken by a sobbing Kyuubi who tried to regain her composure.</p><p><i><b>Is there really nothing I can do anymore?</b></i>, she thought, knowing very well that she couldn't stop him herself because of the stupid seal.</p><p>Her answer was a violent crumbling sound as the whole room, Narutos subconscious, was shocked to its very core and her world went black.</p><p>At first there was only black nothingness. Time itself was erased in this place, wherever it was. She didn't even know whether her existence was ended or not, whether she did even exist at all or not.</p><p>But suddenly there was a violent pull on her entire being and with great force she was thrown out of this depressing place.</p><p>The first thing she heard was ragged breathing combined with violent coughing. Immediately her eyes flied open and she snapped to attention.</p><p>Faintly she was aware of her surroundings, an old one room bunker hidden within the Forest of Death, because she was completely distracted by the sight that greeted her as she laid her eyes upon the man she once considered her servant.</p><p>Thanks to her connection with the blonde she did know every aspect of his plan so she wasn't surprised by seeing the complex seals that were painted on the ground or the via seals reinforced blade sticking in his stomach and piercing the seal like the key it was supposed to be - what shocked her was the puddle of blood beneath him and his skin that was so pale that he looked like a ghost.</p><p>"<b>No!"</b>, she cried with tears in her eyes and her power started to radiate from her entire being, so strong that Naruto winced.</p><p>From one heartbeat to the other the suffocating force retreated and clothes rustled as the redhead, still wearing the kimono she had worn in the mindscape, cradled the head of the blonde gently in her lap, stroking his unruly hair.</p><p>For the first time she could really touch him but it was also the last time…</p><p>The Uzumaki tried to say something but nothing more than chopped croaks left his already blood flooded throat - as Kyuubi became aware of the red liquid in the corners of his mouth and his weakening breathing fear and panic started to take finally control of her mind.</p><p>"<b>Oh dear Kami, please not, why him?"</b>, the redhead sobbed. She froze in shock as a cold hand touched her cheek in a soothing manner and a little bit of his chakra entered her system.</p><p>"Don't… cry… for… me… re… joice… you… are… free… now… fare… well… mis-…", was all the Uzumaki could slowly and painfully mouth, so quiet that she had trouble understanding him, before his body twitched one last time violently and finally went limp.</p><p>As his hand fall from her cheek, landed with a silent sound on the ground and the redhead looked in his almost gray, lifeless eyes she had a mental breakdown. Now she finally understood what her father Kurama once had wanted to make clear, because, how should she live after what she had done and lost?</p><p>~~Flashback~~</p><p>Wondering what he meant a younger Kyuubi asked her father what he wanted to say with that.</p><p>"What? You have seen everything, experienced everything, you have survived. That is the trick, isn't it? To survive.", she questioned.</p><p>"This isn't only about being immortal. The trick is, to live forever with yourself.", Kurama had answered and left to let her think about his words.</p><p>It should take her years to fully and truly understand the wisdom of his words.</p><p>~~Flashback End~~</p><p>Faintly she registered the other occupant of the room - a captain of the Anbu who had felt the spike of energy moments ago and went to investigate it.</p><p>"…o the hell are you? What have you done to this demon brat?", he shouted, anger and irritation clear in his voice, combined with the obvious disgust directed to Naruto. This was the moment Kyuubi finally lost it.</p><p>She snapped, her head whirled around as she still cradled the dead blonde in her lap and the man was vaporized in her youki. Absentmindedly the redhead stroked the cold and bloody face of the blonde one last time.</p><p>"<b>Don't worry my little Naru-kun, I'll make them pay, yes I'll."</b>, she promised with the voice of a maniac as she slowly raised her body. And how they would pay!</p><p>There hate, fear, disgust and coldness towards her Naruto had driven him to this!</p><p>Her mind wasn't capable of reminding her that she had played a very big role in his misery as well.</p><p>All she thought about was the annihilation of all those who had wronged the blonde.</p><p>Tsunade looked silently over her village. It seemed as if it would be just another normal and peaceful day in Konoha, with loads of paperwork for her.</p><p>She wondered where her favorite blonde knucklehead was - Jiraiya had said Naruto has acted odd over the last time and she worried greatly for her adoptive grandson. But her thoughts were interrupted as she and every other living being in Konoha felt the massive spike of energy, before the whole world grew creepily silent.</p><p><i>Wasn't that Kyuubis chakra?</i>, she thought and feared for the health of the Uzumaki.</p><p>However, before she could even think of a reaction the whole Forest of Death was consumed by a dome of fire. As cries of panic started to erupt in the crowd of people on the streets, the giant form of a nine-tailed fox emerged from the flames.</p><p>What followed was the total annihilation of the Hidden Leaf and each of his clans, civilians and shinobi. The confused and unorganized ninjas who tried to fight back never stood a chance and no one ever saw the corpse that was carried by one of the tails.</p><p>It took Kyuubi not even an hour to completely destroy Konoha with fire, fangs, tails, claws and occasional beast bombs, but as the remnants of a once strong village crumbled behind her she had already her next and final target in mind - Madara Uchiha and the scum of Akatsuki.</p><p>The oldest of the Uchihas was brooding about how Konoha once betrayed him as his spy Zetsu told him about the rampaging Kyuubi on the way to Ame, the current hideout of his organization.</p><p>Immediately the mastermind of Akatsuki had a new idea how to accomplish his ultimate plan, but unbeknownst to him it was an idea that would be his personal downfall. In his arrogance he told Pain about his plans and faced hours later the enraged vixen on his own.</p><p>As he tried to gain once again control over her with his unholy eyes he was forced to see how useless his attempts were - everything he gained was a feral grin and before he could even flee he was torn apart.</p><p>Even in her rage Kyuubi registered what had happen - the chakra Naruto injected in her system in his final moments made her immune against the Sharingan.</p><p>Her fury was renewed as she was reminded of his sacrifice and the poor village of Ame was forced to endure her rage to its fullest extent.</p><p>The vixen slaughtered everyone and destroyed everything that dared to came across her. Even as Pain fought her with all of his six paths he wasn't more than a nuisance to the nearly endless might of Kyuubi.</p><p>As everything was over a slightly panting Kitsune stood triumphing above the burning remnants of Ame.</p><p>Slowly she closed her eyes and let sadness overcome her. It didn't matter how many lives she had taken, none of her actions could ever bring her Naruto back, who was still hold firmly by a tail.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by an odd feeling. Like she had felt already today there was again a violent pull on her entire being and her world went black, but what could it be now?</p><p>As she finally regained her senses and looked around her she registered faintly that she was in her human form, as the redhead froze in shock as she came face to face with two very pissed females, Kami and her sister Yami.</p><p>Staring at the furious twin goddesses she felt very, very little and nearly trembled in fear. As the death god entered the scene and gifted her with a disappointed look the air became suffocating.</p><p>"<b>Do you have any idea what you have done?"</b>, the white-headed Kami hissed.</p><p>"<b>Our laws forbid us to interfere with the events on earth and you have used that to your advantage! You have killed the Chosen One, the child of the prophecy! Do you have any idea how big you fucked up? Do you alone understand the problems this is causing?"</b>, roared a furious black-headed Yami.</p><p>"<b>You think you love him? Little vixen, you know nothing of his suffering!"</b>, her sister shouted.</p><p>"<b>It's unbelievable how bold you are, that you dare to say you would love my favorite blonde. You will possibly never understand him, but I've a way to may achieve it."</b>, Yami stated and Kyuubis world went for a single second blank before her entire being was rocked with pain she was never forced to endure before.</p><p>Faint she heard the voice of one of the goddesses. <b>"You'll live through all his pain. All of it." </b></p><p>In the court of Kami time doesn't really exist, but after what seemed like eternity life and conscious returned to the whimpering and shivering human form of the vixen, who wanted nothing more than to curl up into a ball and die.</p><p>"<b>What have I done?"</b>, she whispered weakly between sobs.</p><p>"<b>Something you should regret forever. However, there's a prophecy that has to be fulfilled. We're a little bit in a rush here, so be happy that I grant you a second chance. Shinigami over there will drop you in an alternate timeline where you can start anew, but of course are there specific rules you will not break, because if you do so or fuck up a second time my sister and I will enjoy erasing your whole existence and give Naru-kun someone who can truly love him. I hope I am understood little vixen, if not I'll crush you."</b>, Kami declared and the redhead stared at her with wide eyes.</p><p><b>Second chance?</b>, was everything that came to her mind.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>A/N: Remind what you have and be thankful for it. Never forget to look out for those who are close to you. This is what I want to say, because to lose something precious is in my opinion the hardest thing someone must endure - and in real life you <i><b>never</b></i> get a second chance, maybe in the afterlife, but no one can confirm this.</p><p>I guess now you have finally realized that if I rate my work M, it is M. So don't dare to blame me! Don't worry, I've some lighter ideas up next, I can't get you all depressed and stuff like that now, can I?</p><p>And yes, this was the indirect prologue for a new fanfiction, but this idea will have to wait a bit.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p>A/N: After growing fed up with my always rewriting and finally deciding how to continue my OS 'Purpose' I can now proudly present you the prologue for the sequel, which I will be labeled under 'Second Chance' for obvious reasons, even if 'Purpose' itself will have a big impact on the whole story. As you'll see I'll not just follow the canon, but instead insert some bigger or minor twists and turns, which will very much later result in a crossover. I really hope you like it, so enough with the blabbering and on with the story.</p><p>The pairing will be strictly , at least for now. If I ever should decide to add someone than it will definitely be a lot of chapters later.<br>Enjoy!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i><b>Purpose – Book II</b></i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Second Chance<br></b><i>Prologue – A New Beginning</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The proposal of being happy with Naruto, this time truly was so amazing for Kyuubi that she was ready to face and bear everything Kami and Yami would decide to put her through. The twin goddesses had left her alone after some more torture to think about it, as they and the Shinigami, who apparently had actually no other name beside his title, were forced to clean up a mess another Naruto had made.</p><p>From what she overheard by chance he managed to summon the Shinigami, something he wasn't supposed to do. Adding this to everything the redheaded vixen was put through in the last moments, time itself seemingly didn't matter here, caused her to have now a serious headache, but she guessed she could understand now.</p><p>It seemed as if this whole thing Kyuubi was stuck in for the moment was some kind of Nexus, a gate that linked all the worlds Kami and Yami ruled as gods about. She imagined Kami's court as a tree and all of the other realms and timelines as leaves – everything else would only give her a bigger headache or scare the shit out of her. To think that she wasn't the only nine-tailed Kitsune, that her existence itself wasn't unique…</p><p>The redhead was forced out of her musings, as Kami and Yami appeared in front of her, both of them looking slightly disturbed and exhausted. She decided to use this moment to pose a question she wondered about ever since she came here.</p><p>"Kami-sama, forgive me, but why exactly are you even blessing me with a second chance at life? I know how much I have done wrong, but seeing how hard I hurt Naruto… why are you even caring about my existence, when you can so easily eradicate me? When you can give him someone who truly loves him?", the vixen asked, desperate since she really couldn't understand why she was allowed to be happy with her favorite blonde, to make things right once and for all.</p><p>Her question caused the twin goddesses to look at each other, exchanging glances before they turned to face the redhead, seemingly slightly uncomfortable.</p><p>"Well, it's hard to explain because you definitely have a point there.", Yami started shifting in her place and looking around as if she expected something to happen. "Look, it's better for you to not think about it.", Kami added.</p><p>"But why me?", Kyuubi asked, pressing the matter further. The white-haired goddess stared silently at the redhead, obviously deep in thought, before her eyes got a far-away look. "You may think of us two as almighty beings, capable of doing anything we wish to – but the truth is, that there is someone, or to put it better <i>something</i>, that stands even above us. It has no name, but power that outranks ours rather easily. My sister and I believe that it is the embodiment of a true god, for it can manipulate fate, time, hell even reality. Nothing happens without its will.", she explained, causing her sister to shiver involuntarily and the vixen to gasp in shock.</p><p>"You… you're kidding, right? This is just a bad joke, is it?", the redhead asked desperately, her voice and being shaking. <i>If this is true…</i>, she thought and shivered. This wasn't something she wanted to think about. But before the twin goddesses could answer her silent plead, reality itself was rewritten.</p><p>Blinding light was emitted from everywhere and as the Kitsune was blinded she could faintly hear two choked gasps as she was forced flat on the ground by a power that not only nearly took her life away once more but also easily outranked the combined might of Kami, Yami and her own too.</p><p>"<b>You overstepped the line again, foolish little girls. Did you truly believe, that I wouldn't notice this?"</b>, a seemingly disembodied and powerful voice spoke up and Kyuubi looked frantic around, but her eyes were still blinded by the light as she struggled to stand up, the almighty power concentrating elsewhere. Then she heard the screams of pain from the twin goddesses and whirled in the direction of the sound, even if her mind screamed at her to run – she needed to know one thing. <i>Why?</i></p><p>The pleas for mercy were ignored and deep down the redhead was shivering. This only increased as her orbs adjusted to the brightness and she was greeted with a sight she would never be able to forget – a massive, giant, light-framed being towering over the bloody and nearly lifeless bodies of the twin goddesses.</p><p>"What have you done?", she gasped in shock as Yami moaned in pain, blood dripping from her lip.</p><p>"<b>This is none of your business, little vixen. You may should think about how you address me, foolish little girl."</b>, the being said, his voice like thunder. Kyuubi was forced to avert her eyes, the light that surrounded the god was just too bright, but still, despite the fear she should feel, there was only rage building up inside of her, quickly reaching the boiling point.</p><p>"It is very well my business you foolish idiot!", she shouted and pointed a complaining finger at him, ignoring the pleading glances from Kami and Yami.</p><p>"You let people suffer and use them as if they and their lives mean absolutely nothing to you, hell, you even treat goddesses as if they were your toys. If you dare to call yourself a god, then you are nothing more than a very sick bastard. I-", the redhead spat, but was forced to interrupt her raging as the being simply raised his hand and she was choked.</p><p>Desperately clawing at her own throat to do whatever was possible against this pressure, she fall to her knees as life itself drained from her.</p><p>"<b>Your actions are foolish, Kyuubi no Yoko or should I say Akira no Kitsune?"</b>, the god questioned, sounding almost amused at the vixen's in utter shock and confusion contorted features.</p><p>"<b>Seriously, what did you expect foolish little girl? My knowledge and power lay beyond the paths of those who have seen life and death. I am stronger than the combined force of everything I have ever created and will create. Do you really think I care about any of you? There is only thing that has to be acquired and I am willing to sacrifice anything and everything to achieve it."</b>, the being spoke and the pressure vanished from her throat. Kyuubi gasped desperately for air.</p><p>But the breath stopped in her lungs and her heart nearly halted as she saw the god raising a hand and only a few feet away from her a shape raised directly from or out the ground itself and took her form.</p><p>"<b>I call forth life."</b>, the being stated as the two redheads stared at each other in pure shock.</p><p>"<b>And I can bring to death whoever whenever I want."</b>, the god said and with a simple swish of his hand the newly created Kyuubi crumbled to dust.</p><p>"<b>So do you understand now whom you are daring to oppose, foolish child of the Sage? Do you even consider the limitless potential, the infinite possibilities I have?"</b></p><p>"Who cares! You could have made this and every other world a peaceful paradise, but instead you decided to let all of us run in our own deaths just because of your own selfish desires! Where is the fucking reason in our existence when you have the last say in everything? Why should I even consider trying to earn my beloved Naruto's love if you can pretend it again and again? Where is the sense in struggling if you can destroy everything we ever created? Just what the hell are you?", the vixen ranted, not caring about anything anymore.</p><p>She was scared, confused and half-death and here was the one and only thing that was to be held responsible in the long run, the only one that stood between her and her beloved. The vixen's vision fogged with the red mist of rage.</p><p>"<b>I will destroy you!"</b>, she snarled, her youki flared in angry vortex around her as the redhead throw herself at the grinning god – only to phase right through him and receive the beating of her life.</p><p>Kyuubi did not know how long she was burned, poisoned, drowned and beaten, but as the god finished she was as close to death as never before.</p><p>"<b>Even if I could and should kill you for your attempt of harming me, I will not do so. Consider yourself lucky that it was from the beginning my and only my idea to grant you a second chance. Now that you have experienced the greatest pain possible, you will think twice about ever harming my Chosen One."</b>, the god stated as he examined his nails, totally disinterested with the three nearly death females in front of him.</p><p>And even if the three should have had other problems in this moment they couldn't help but gasp at the sudden revelation.</p><p><i>What? But why did he let everything happen then?</i>, was their unified thought.</p><p>"<b>Anyway, even if I don't want to admit it, we all are actually running out of time sa mentioned by these foolish girls. So, choose now Kyuubi. I would rather not force you in your second chance or everything would be in vain. Will you try again? Will you accept my offer to be granted a second chance at being happy with Naruto?"</b>, the god asked, a unknown genuine sincerity in his voice.</p><p>The redhead could only nod weakly as her body was to soar to do anything else.</p><p>"<b>Then it is time now. Shinigami! Fulfill your duty."</b>, said the unnamed god as his form started to vanish, but his last words managed to freeze everyone, even the twin goddesses who struggled with standing up. <b>"You should train yourself and don't slack off, little girl. One day we will meet again and then you and your beloved should be prepared."</b></p><p>Before the vixen could even start to comprehend what that cryptic statement should mean, her world blackened. All she managed to see before darkness enveloped her was a short glimpse at a giant toad in front of her, a burning village in the distance and the spectral form of the reaper, for it couldn't be a death god anymore. After all, she had seen a true god, even if this was an experience she did not want to have again.</p><p><i>This time I will protect you, Naru-kun and I will stop at nothing to ensure your safety. Behold villagers of Konoha, a demoness has returned with her mind made up. Let us shock the world with an unrivaled power.</i>, was her last thought before she was forced behind the bars she despised.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>A/N:</b> I know, I know, it isn't really long, even for a prologue. But still, I hope you liked my idea so far. Maybe one of you has a little idea as to what I'm hinting at in general, all I will reveal now is that I plan on making a total of four related 'books'. The first was the prologue 'Purpose' itself, the second you just started to read and the rest… well; let us keep it a surprise for now.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed and your reviews are appreciated.</p><p>See ya,</p><p>QW</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p><b>A/N:</b> Well, I don't have much to say to this one, besides that I may make a total of five books. Anyway, enjoy the recent chapter and sorry for the long waiting time.</p><p>Yes, I named Kyuubi here Akira - Kurama sounds to much like a guy, at least in my opinion.</p><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> As always, who is caring anyway?</p><p><b>Edit Note:</b> Fanfiction is wrecking my design - therefore thinking is from now on <i>'…thinking…'</i>.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i><b>Purpose – Book II</b></i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Second Chance<br></b><i>Chapter I </i><i>–</i><i> Creating A Hero</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>~~Unknown Location~~</b></p><p>Whatever this place was or whatever had caused this seemingly endless plain to turn into something like this kind of abomination had resulted in creating a world where no form of living was capable of maintaining its existence. There was no sunlight reaching through the gray heaven, where clouds of white, black and gray raced to an unknown destination. It was even possible that there wasn't even a sun to begin with and the light that allowed one to see was nothing more than a sourceless twilight or emitted by the remnants of a long dead star.</p><p>The ground was of the same color like everything else, but instead made of a strange fog-like substance that yet apparently remained solid enough to allow walking on it – as proven by the person that, even if wearing strange clothes of foreign design, paced restlessly around an object that seemed to be a throne crafted out of one massive stone. Whoever chose to sit here did seemingly not value comfortable seating. Maybe he just had a barbaric mindset – just think about it, who wouldn't enjoy a comfy seat?</p><p>"What is happening? He is already too late, but in the end I may should have known that something like this was bound to happen. Why did he choose, especially in his condition, to do this alone?", the person voiced her questions aloud, the tone indicating that the stranger was male and quite irritated.</p><p>As if wanting to answer him, a portal was opened only a few feet away from him. Immediately, in a burst of pure speed, the man was in front of what he considered something akin to a personal offense, a weapon of even stranger design than his robe-like clothes drawn and pointed at the gate. Upon closer inspection the nameless weapon seemed to be a combination of a sword and a scythe. However, whatever it was its purpose was clear to even the naked and untrained eye – beheading.</p><p>But the very first moment the man recognized the figure that stepped out of the portal his weapon disappeared and he kneeled in front of the only one that was stronger than him. Ungodly pressure that would have crushed everyone else was emitted as the creator of worlds left the gate completely. Laying his eyes upon the kneeling figure in front of him, the one that was the only god to ever be, sighed in annoyance and slowly started to restrict his power, the light that surrounded him dying down along with it.</p><p>"<b>Rise, old friend. Seriously, how often did I tell you over the course of the last eons to stop with this nonsense?</b><b>"</b>, the creator questioned, only the slightest bit irritated.</p><p>The man did as told, all the while scratching the back of his head in embarrassment and chuckling sheepishly.</p><p>"Sorry, it is the force of an old habit I am hardly getting rid of. Anyway, how was your little journey?", he intrigued, only to receive a 'Not now.' as answer.</p><p>In silence the god walked up to his throne, to take a seat before facing his oldest and most loyal companion, someone he considered a brother, who stood on front of him, waiting patiently for him to start speaking. By now the light that once surrounded the creator had finally completely died down, revealing his astonishing ordinary features to the 'world'.</p><p>Short black hair, dark eyes and slightly tanned skin were his only visible features, the rest was obscured from view by a black cloak – but the way it bulged indicated that the god was either extremely muscled or clad in a heavy and thick armor. A jagged scar that missed his left eye and mouth by less than the tenth of an inch showed in combination with the wisdom, knowledge and power which were visible in the depths of his eyes that he was no one to be taken lightly – his whole being spoke of being unrivaled.</p><p>Still, there was more to him than just the obvious – and his comrade knew of that. Creating a chair for himself the robed male took a seat in front of his oldest friend. For a moment they stared at each other.</p><p>"It is obvious that something is troubling you. Talk.", he almost ordered the creator. The deity sighted in response.</p><p>"<b>It hadn</b><b>'</b><b>t gone as smooth as I had expected and anticipated it to. This time Kyuubi actually dared to stand up against me. Even if hadn</b><b>'</b><b>t wanted to and probably shouldn</b><b>'</b><b>t have done so I was forced to remind her of her place below me, at least for now. The violation of my laws by Kami and Yami had to be punished as well. I fear things went a little bit overboard. Right now I feel closer to death than ever before and I doubt that I could create another realm. If my </b><b>'</b><b>Second Chance</b><b>'</b><b> project fails I have only one choice left and that means I would be forced to make you my successor and go alone to what awaits us after we fulfilled our duty here.</b><b>"</b>, the god explained, startling his companion with the defeat and utter hopelessness that lay in his voice, but before the almost shell-shocked man could retort, the creator continued already, ignoring his friend and his eyes trained at a faraway place no mortal could ever hope reaching.</p><p>"<b>I am tired, not only of this life but also of this duty. I mean, just look at me. What have I ever reached, which goals acquired and dreams fulfilled? I will answer it for you </b><b>–</b><b> in my whole existence not even one of those. As my first love was taken from me I started to lose everything else as well, because of the path I chose, which did lead me ultimately to this barren place.</b><b>"</b>, the creator sighed and run a hand through his hair.</p><p>"<b>I have everything, but yet at the same time nothing. My family is long since dead, not even a distant relative is alive anymore and children of my own I never had."</b></p><p>Here he paused for a moment, allowing the words he had just spoken to sink in.</p><p>"<b>I even have to doubt that there is someone out there besides you who does know of my old and true identity. In the end I accomplished nothing and can't convince myself to believe in the afterlife anymore – not with the power I wield. To top all of it I don't even know my name anymore as well as I can only hardly remember single events of the peaceful lives we once had and lived."</b></p><p>Silence reigned once more, but there was a thick tension in the air.</p><p>"<b>I am nothing short of an abomination, maybe a faker or an imposer. The shell of a once proud man with dreams who never came true that became the holder of unrivaled and uncomprehend forces </b><b>–</b><b> powers that shouldn</b><b>'</b><b>t even exist in the first place. I am an offense to Mother Nature and every law of the world and physics, the only things I cannot break and only bend them to a certain degree. Being who I am I can</b><b>'</b><b>t even believe in fate </b><b>–</b><b> where is the point in doing so when I am the creator of worlds, dictating fate for everything and everyone I created, where and what is the reason for my existence? Sometimes it feels as if there is someone even above us </b><b>–</b><b> a thought I really don</b><b>'</b><b>t like, because that would make everything nothing but the game of a sick and twisted mind </b><b>–</b><b> and us the played.</b><b>"</b>, the god said, grim bitterness displayed by his whole posture and mirrored by his friend.</p><p>"So you think that way too? Heh, maybe if there is someone then he is considering himself, as 'writer of fate', as some kind of 'author'."</p><p>The silence after that sarcastic statement lasted only a few seconds, before both started chuckling and the tension was lifted.</p><p>"That was quite a good one, if I say so myself. Anyway, I know that you choose the Uzumaki boy for a reason, but aren't you exaggerating it at least a little bit right now? You know, all this work and in the end we can't even be sure if he survives the last challenge before being allowed in the world where we once were tested and where he must prove himself one last time and is then judged worthy of facing us or being erased. Why necessarily him, if you have countless other lives at your disposal? I don't really get it and I believe that you owe me at least this truth, don't you think?", the robed person intrigued, sounding genuinely curios.</p><p>The god did something in response he never had before – and avoided the questioning gaze of his comrade.</p><p>"<b>That isn't something I could explain right now. For the moment you must come to a conclusion on your own."</b></p><p>To avoid further interrogation the creator made a circling motion with his hand and the ground between him and the other man rippled, before turning into something akin to a screen. Upon closer inspection it became obvious that it showed a picture of Konoha. Making another silent motion, the tower of the Hokage came into view.</p><p>"<b>For now, let us watch how our successor will fare.</b><b>"</b>, the deity stated, earning a look of disbelief from his partner.</p><p>"But what about the other worlds, after all it is your duty to watch over them as well.", the man almost scolded.</p><p>"<b>I did what I was capable of doing. My energy is enough to maintain their existence, nothing more and nothing less. They will have to survive on their own for the moment."</b></p><p>He was taken aback by the coldness and indifference of his friend, but a look in his eyes told him more than words could ever do. So he accepted the decision, vowing to himself to do what was necessary in order to allow the project to come through.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>~~With the Hokage~~</b></p><p>Hiruzen Sarutobi was currently not only having a major headache, but also the possibly most worst day in his life – and with him being well past his prime this actually meant something. Rubbing his sore forehead slightly, the old man couldn't help but feel defeated. Putting his beloved pipe away Sarutobi sighed as he watched over the desk of his successor. It seemed that his personal enemy, paperwork, whom he escaped from as he named Minato as Yondaime, was once more very eager to greet him. And the masses of paper would only increase with tomorrow.</p><p>Turning around he looked over the village he loved so much – or to put it in better terms, what was left of it. This night Konoha had suffered from a very unlikely attack – the Kyuubi no Kitsune himself had broken free of Kushina's seal because of unknown circumstances. From what he could get out of the Namikaze before his death, someone with an orange spiral mask had taken advantage of the situation, using the newborn as hostage after he did the thought impossible – breaking through the ANBU defense lines and the advanced barrier seals.</p><p>Shedding a silent tear the Sandaime allowed himself a moment to mourn the death of not only his successor and the Jinchuuriki, but also of his wife, Biwako. Walking the short distance to the crib that was situated right next to his desk with a young, purple-haired female ANBU watching over the baby boy, he couldn't help but feel sorry for Naruto. Not only parentless, but also the new Jinchuuriki of the Kyuubi. Kami did apparently know no mercy when it came to the tailed-beasts and their hosts. How wrong he was with that statement, he of course couldn't know.</p><p>Looking intently at the young child, he noticed absentmindedly how jumpy Yugao was.</p><p>"Everything alright, Neko-san?", Hiruzen questioned.</p><p>The Sandaime was concerned, because right now he couldn't need any flaws, or in a worst case scenario, his own men and women going crazy in the aftermath of this devastation. If they dared to attack Naruto no one could know what would happen to the seal, and therefore by extension to the Kyuubi, if Sarutobi wouldn't manage to defeat them. He may was the 'God of Shinobi', but age was catching up to him.</p><p>"Yes. I just can't believe that Kushina-sensei really is dead and that her son was sacrificed. There is this feeling that I can't really shake off – call it a sixth sense of foreboding if you want. I fear for the health and wellbeing of Naruto. Am I allowed to speak freely?"</p><p>"Sure, go ahead.", Sarutobi answered, activating the privacy seals along the way.</p><p>"As soon as the council gets wind of this, they will be in nothing short of an uproar, especially these greedy civilians. In my honest opinion they should had never been allowed to have a place in a hidden village - please make sure for the sake of the Fourth to remind them that we are in a military dictatorship, a place where they have absolutely nothing to say against the ultimate vote of the Kage. You are still a legend. Please protect Naruto-kun to the best of your abilities, if I were in your place I would do anything that would be necessary to ensure the safety of this boy. I believe that his worth is far greater than we can imagine right now.", the ANBU stated, earning a tentative nod from the Sandaime.</p><p>Of course, both didn't know how true this ultimately was. But just because his worth in a greater scheme was immense, didn't necessarily mean that his worth was good or important on a lower level. Still, future is only predictable to a certain degree. How the Uzumaki, this time with the support of a certain vixen hell-bent on protecting him, would turn out was solely a decision of his own - under consideration of the circumstances he would find himself in later.</p><p>"I understand your concern Neko-san. Still, how far are you willing to go in order to protect your sensei's son? In the moment you are possibly the most suited for the job, still, I have to see how the council is going to react and no moment sooner I can make a decision.", Sarutobi said, already falling back in his role as a leader.</p><p>"If necessary I would be his full-term bodyguard, his teacher and even mother him. That is the least I owe Kushina.", the purple-haired woman stated, full of confidence.</p><p>"Very well. Is there something else you would want to add?", he asked and as the young female merely shook her head the Hokage deactivated the seals.</p><p>'<i>The council is the lesser of the two things I fear. Danzo is going to be the real problem in the upcoming decisions, I don</i><i>'</i><i>t know what he will be up to this time, but it can</i><i>'</i><i>t be something pleasant, considering what he was ready to do in order to get his hands on the previous host of the Kyuubi.'</i>, the old man mused.</p><p>Training his eyes on the child, he wondered aloud.</p><p>"Just what exactly are you dreaming of? I just hope the Kyuubi isn't bothering you Naruto-kun."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>~~In the depths of Naruto's mindscape~~</b></p><p>Well, what the redheaded vixen was currently doing could hardly be called bothering - and the wagging of her tails, even if she was absolutely capable of spelling disaster with one simple motion of them, couldn't really be considered threatening, especially if she had absolutely no intention of harming the newborn she hold cautiosly in her arms. The moment the Uzumaki had fallen asleep he appeared in the mindscape and the bars that held her disappeared, allowing her to take action.</p><p>Little Naruto's conscious was wrapped in a simple sheet, just like his body in the outside world, and Akira cradled the blond's form gently and lovingly to her generous bosom, humming a soft happy tune. She was aware that the seal wasn't how it should have been, or to put it in better terms, how it had been the last time - yet she didn't know the full extent of the alterations and how it would affect the future.</p><p>But in the moment, she couldn't quite come to care. The vixen was reunited with the only one she ever loved and right now the redhead felt content. Still, there was much to do in the future. Akira had to examine the seal to its very depths and then act properly, under consideration of what she had learned only moments prior from the terrifying god.</p><p>That reminded her of something very important - Akatsuki. In order to overcome this nuisance the redhead would have to take either drastic measures concerning the training of her lover so that Naruto could defeat them on his own or she would have to take care of this hindrance herself. An almost inaudible escaped her lips. So much to do and not enough time.</p><p>'<i>At least I have you back. This time I will not be so blinded like the last time. I swear by my honor, my love and my life that I will protect you, Naru-kun. With my knowledge of the future, my power and your devotion we will reach beyond mortal limits.'</i>, she thought and gave the boy a light kiss on the forehead.</p><p>'<i>I can't wait until you have grown.'</i>, the vixen mused, never once doubting that Naruto would love her - especially given the life that lay ahead of him.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>A/N:</b> I hope that cleared a few open questions. Next chapter the council will be in an uproar and Naruto's path will start.</p><p>I have a minor problem with the new chapter of 'Infinite Heavenly Song', but I am working on it - and got thankfully a beta for the story!</p><p>See ya,<br>QW</p>
