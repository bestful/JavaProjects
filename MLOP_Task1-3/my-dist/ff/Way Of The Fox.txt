Naruto shivered in the
cold rain as it pounded down upon his shoulders. He felt around
reaching for a foothold, anything he could latch onto to save
himself. The metallic taste of blood filled his mouth and the stench
of burnt flesh attacked his nose. He leaned over and vomited. This
was life for a 6 year-old Naruto Uzamaki.</P><P>Naruto wiped his mouth and drank from
the slowly building puddle next to him, the bile still filling his
mouth with its acrid taste. He slowly stood and tried to walk, only
to feel an intense pain shoot through his leg. The searing pain was
enough to push him into a wistful unconsciousness. At last the pain
was subsiding. The world turned black.</P><P>Naruto awoke only to find himself in a
sewer filled knee high with water. Taking tentative steps, he
approached the gates with the kanji for seal on it. He called out.</P><P>"Hello?"</P><P>There was a deep grumbling in the
distance as if a storm were brewing. Then the sound of lumbering
steps approached the gates.</P><P>"<B>Who dares disturb the slumber of
the Great Kyuubi no Kitsune," </B>the voice said.</P><P>The young boy looked up in awe at a
great fox. It had nine flowing tails and red fur the color of blood.
It looked down upon him with s light annoyed look. When their eyes
met, the fox's gaze seemed to soften for a second but quickly
steeled once more.</P><P>"I do," Naruto replied in a small
voice, sadly.</P><P>"<B>Oh, and who might you be?"</B></P><P>"Naruto Uzamaki sir."</P><P>"<B>Sir? I'm no sir I assure you
that!"</B></P><P>"But you must be! Your voice is a
deep rumble and very low. There is no way you are a female!"</P><P>"<B>Well if you don't take my word
then I'll have to show you."</B></P><P>The fox was quickly gone and a cloud
of smoke followed by a 'poof' made Naruto shield his eyes. When
he returned his gaze towards the cage his draw dropped. Standing
there was a girl, no a woman, of twenty. She was in red kimono, the
same color of the fox's fur. She had red hair that went halfway
down her back. Her nails were claws but they were red as if she had
just killed and blood had still stained her hands. The most alluring
characteristic though had to be her face. She had high cheekbones
giving her a feeling of power. Her face was narrowed and her nose was
pointy. It was like if a fox had grown the head of a woman. Six
whiskers outfitted her nose giving her a slightly feral look. Her
eyes were a great sea blue like Naruto's own. Her chest was
abundant enough to even outshine the Slug Sannin. In one word she was
beautiful.</P><P>She looked down at Naruto through the
bars of the cage. She smirked when she saw his dazed expression and
the slight trickle of blood coming from his nose. Who knew a 6
year-old blonde could have such a reaction?</P><P>"<B>Haha, kit. So you must like what
you see."</B></P><P>Naruto looked at the ground in
embarrassment. He then looked up with a slight smile, even though his
eyes were sad.</P><P>"So you are the reason for my hatred
aren't you?"</P><P>"<B>Admittedly yes. However not all
bad will come from me. You will son learn this weather you want to or
not. If you want to do it the easy way please listen. I am sealed
within you and I am restrained by this cage but also this seal. You
can remove this seal though. If you were to remove it piece by piece,
leaving a period of rest between each, you will be given my power and
release me. Don't worry though. I will not be able to retain a fox
state. I will lose all but one tail of my chakra and the rest will be
given to you. You will in a word become a demon. You will become the
next Kyuubi."</B></P><P>This news shocked the young boy. He
looked up with teary eyes. He desperately wanted respect this was
certain. Through this power he could! He made up his mind. He would
free the Kyuubi. In a blind fit of passion he stood up from where he
was sitting and ran towards the cage. In a swift motion he tore the
seal off.</P><P>"<B>Baka! You were supposed to do it
in different pieces! Oh well now your gonna just be in a shit load of
pain." </B></P><P>His mindscape blurred and he
awoke under the same tree he passed out under hour's prior. He
stood completely healed like usual. He took one step but suddenly a
searing pain from his stomach made him drop to his knees. A red
chakra ball shot from his stomach and engulfed his body. A separate
thin stream broke off and the same body he saw in the cage of his
mind started to materialize. He moaned in agony. The whole process
took about an hour. After passing out for the umpteenth time, he
awakens to a frazzled Kyuubi in her human form laying over him
checking his pulse.</P><P>"Ah I see you are awake now," she
said.</P><P>"Yeah. Hey why do my clothes feel
tight?" he responded.</P><P>She giggled. "That's because you
grew at least six inches. I'd say you are now 4' 5", pretty
tall for a six year old. Oh, and don't think your just going to go
buy another one of those horrid pieces of cloth. Your wardrobe needs
a woman's touch to it and I'm the perfect woman for the job. Oh
and I recommend a henge for your ears, tails and claws."</P><P>Naruto looked at his hands. They were
in fact clawed. He swung his tail and scratched his- wait tail? He
turned around and gasped. Here were eight golden tails sprouting from
his lower back. His jaw dropped. He then promptly passed out.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>Same speech as last time… so to
answer some q's yes this will be a basher and a harem. I don't
write gay fics. As for the girls I'm going to let you guys decide
(those of you who actually read my garbage). Now I'm taking
suggestions on everything since this is my first fic. I like writing
about challenging pairs though and rare pairs. People like Hana,
Yugao, Tsunade and Shizune are fun to write about since they aren't
done that often. Kyuubi will be in it. If you want Hinata in it I
will put her in but she's too easy to write in. Its like I" love
you ok lets go have smex." That's not cool. I'd rather have
Hinata be with like Shino. Or lee. Shion is a good one too because of
the dullness of Naruto and the implied sex she wanted. I will need a
lemon writer and if anyone wants to be a co-writer then hell I am up
for it.</B></P><P><B>Possible:</B></P><P><B>Temari</B></P><P><B>Ten-Ten</B></P><P><B>Female Uchicha O.C.</B></P><P><B>Fem. Gaara</B></P><P><B>Kin</B></P><P><B>Any others please put up. This will
be strictly an A/N.</B></P><P><B>SOMEONE PLEASE OFFER SOME
SUGGESTIONS/OFFER TO CO WRITE. I HAVE A VERY BUSY SCHEDULE SO IF I DO
IT ALONE ITD TAKE ME LIKE 2 WEEKS FOR A BIG CHAPTER TO COME OUT!</B></P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><B>Same speech as last chapter!</B></P><P><B>A/N: Ten-Ten will be in since I
intend for there to be an arc where Naruto quests for a sword and
Ten-Ten is chosen to go with him because of weapon expertise. I will
be writing in girls like this: There will be an encounter then a
whole arc behind them then MAYBE something will happen then. It will
be SLOW. Suddenly falling in love doesn't happen.</B></P><P><B>Temari is a might. I love Shizune
because of the irony that the guy goes for the shadow of the
so-called "bombshell". </B></P><P><B>Now on with the show…</B></P><P><B>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</B></P><P>Naruto awoke with a mind-numbing pain
in his head. He looked around and found himself in a bed. Wait not a
bed, <I>his</I> bed. How the hell…? Then he remembered. Kyuubi, the
tails, the ears and such, and how he now had eight of the nine total
tails. He got in to a sitting position, his back in the headboard of
the bed. He heard a…purring was the word he'd use to describe it.
He peered at the edge of the bed and almost died due to him face
vaulting so hard. On the edge of the bed was Kyuubi, curled up like a
cat would to a master. But that wasn't the thing that made him
face-vault. The thing that made him do so was what Kyuubi was
holding. A chibi version of Naruto with eight tails was crushed to
her chest. Naruto went over and nudged Kyuubi awake gently. She
opened her eyes yawning while rubbing her eyes. All in all, it was
very cute sight to behold.</P><P>Naruto chuckled to himself. He used one
of his newly acquired feather dusters (A.K.A. tails) to tickle her
side. This caused her to try and hide her giggle. Which led to a
smirking Naruto.</P><P>"I didn't know the great Kyuubi no
Kitsune was <I>ticklish</I>!"</P><P>He lunged at her and initiated the
tickle fight. He had Kyuubi pinned down with all of his tails and was
on her stomach when there was a bang on the door. The little boy
scampered from his position and peered through the tiny hole in his
door. Standing there was the third hokage. Naruto gulped. He didn't
know what to do. He couldn't just stand there in all of his demon
lord glory before the old man. Kyuubi ran over to Naruto.</P><P>"Here quick! I'll cast a henge over
you!" she shouted in a hushed voice.</P><P>"Okay." He responded in an equally
hushed but yet urgent tone.</P><P>Kyuubi molded chakra and did a hand
sign and Naruto was back to the way he would be without the fox
traits. He opened the door and a smiling Sarutobi. He quickly wiped
his hands off on his shirt. The third he could tell was shocked over
his new appearance. Not only was the boy taller but there seemed to
be someone else in the room with him. Drawing a kunai, Sarutobi
motioned for Naruto to come here.</P><P>"Naruto I think there is someone else
here." He hissed.</P><P>"Oh I know. She came over…awhile
ago." He responded with a cheerful demeanor. He wasn't sure if he
should trust the old man. He knew he cared about him but the Kyuubi
was a big deal.</P><P>"She?"</P><P>"What? Oh yeah she came over about a
week ago since she needed a place to stay. We know each other from…a
circumstance which was unpleasant at the least."</P><P>"Naruto I must say I came here to see
how you were after yesterday. I know the villagers like to hurt you
for some reason every year on you birthday. I don't know w-"</P><P>"Old man I know about it!" He
quickly interrupted with slight malice in his voice.</P><P>To say The Third was shocked would be
like saying Tobi is only slightly funny. It was a huge
understatement. His face paled immediately and he was trying to
stammer out an answer. Naruto only smiled sadly, a thing, which a six
year old should not be capable of but he was. He walked over to the
Fire Shadow and put his hand on his shoulder. He looked in to the
eyes of the only man who ever took care of him and smiled a small
smile but it was a real smile his time. Not a fake one but a rare,
true smile.</P><P>"Old man, I know about Kyuubi. In
fact I've had many conversations with her. But the least you
could've done was tell me! I mean I have wondered for years why I
was beaten within inches of losing my life. Now that I know I think I
should leave the village for awhile." Naruto said slowly and
pronouncing each word carefully. This had to work in order for Kyuubi
to be able to teach him. He just hoped the hokage wouldn't find out
that the Kyuubi was loose.</P><P>"Oh? Why is this?" Sarutobi replied
genuinely surprised. He never knew that the boy would think about
leaving the village.</P><P>'Damn' "Well my friend offered to
teach me in the way of the ninja. I wish to travel with her. I would
return when I turn 16 but not before that." He replied with a clam
demeanor even tough his palms could be considered drenched with his
own sweat.</P><P>"Oh well I see. Even though I really
don't agree with this I will let you go. However I would like a
report every month to see how you are improving." 'And to make
sure he doesn't develop a hate for this damn village'.</P><P>"Okay will do old man. Now can you
please leave so I can get ready for my trip?"</P><P>"Sure. Ja ne!" The hokage body
flickered away leaving a giddy Naruto. He was practically skipping
back to his room. When he reentered it, he saw a fully dressed Kyuubi
on his bed rummaging through his drawers.</P><P>"Don't you have anything that <I>isn't
</I>orange?" She asked quite disgruntled. She couldn't have her
kit prancing around in basically a target outfit. She let out an
upset humph and walked over to Naruto. She lifted him up by his
collar.</P><P>'You, me shopping now!" She stated
pretty miffed that she actually had to do this. Naruto gulped. He
wasn't sure if it was good that he was being helped by a pretty
girl like the one in front of him or scared for his life. Kyuubi
shunshinned them to a ninja store. It was named the White Wolf. <B>(A/N:
This is the part where Naruto will meet Ten-Ten and when he comes
back from the training mission, this will be his only friend his age,
so then she is the first person that he will meet after coming back.
They will hang out then there will be a mission to quest for a sword
and then they see each other in a more romantic light.) </B></P><P>Naruto and Kyuubi strolled through the
otherwise deserted store looking through the wares as they passed by.
Naruto felt a drawing to the orange clothing, which was quickly
stomped out by a growl from Kyuubi. No one wants an angry bjuu on his
or her tail(s). As they walked to the counter in order to get
Naruto's new measurements, they saw a girl, Naruto's age with two
buns on the top of her head. She was wearing Chinese style clothes
and was shorter than him by about half a foot. She looked up at the
two from her place on the countertop. She smiled and ran to get her
father. When she returned with a man around his forties, he smiled
and quickly beckoned after they explained why they were here.</P><P>After getting measured the man and
Kyuubi began arguing over the price for the weights and kunai. The
little girl walked over to Naruto and introduced herself.</P><P>"Hello my name is Ten-Ten, what's
yours?" She inquired.</P><P>"Naruto." He replied with some
enjoyment as he was finally becoming friends with one his own age.
She smiled at him and dragged him over to clothes in his own size.
She was intent on making him wear the pink battle armor but Naruto
sweat-dropped at the thought. He saw something out of the corner of
his eye. It was a blood red battle robe. It was in his size, which
was surprising as not many six year olds wore battle clothing. He
fingered the sleeves and was marveled by the fabric. It was soft, but
felt like it could withstand a direct blow by a smaller blade like
shuriken or kunai. It had a hood and many pockets for stowing things.
Naruto quickly grabbed it off the hanger and put it on. Underneath it
he had a pair of black ANBU pants and a fishnet shirt. He looked at
himself in the mirror. All in all, he looked pretty good. The girl
took him by his hand once more and pulled him over to where the
swords were.</P><P>"Every ninja has a blade that they
use and as such…" Naruto had stopped listening as his eyes lie
upon a pair of dual wakizashi. One hilt was red and the other's
hilt was a pure white. Both sheaths were red with the kanji for fox
carved into the blade. Kyuubi looked over at the two children and saw
Naruto gaping at the blade. She smiled and walked over.</P><P>"We could get them if you like."
She said softly in his ear. He looked at her and grinned almost
manically. He then wrapped his arms around her in a bone-crushing
hug. She was taken aback. She hasn't had human contact in
centuries. Everyone was too scared to be near her but here, a boy not
even ten, was hugging her like she was a normal person. She warily
wrapped her arms around him too with a faint blush on her face.</P><P>"ThankyouThankyouThankyouThankyouThankyouThankyou."
He replied enthusiastically. She returned to the man and started
haggling for a price of the swords. The girl came over and asked if
he wanted her mom to sew anything onto the robe he had purchased. He
remembered the kanji for fox on his swords.</P><P>"Hmm, can I have maybe the kanji for
Warrior Fox, on my back?" He asked.</P><P>"Sure!" Ten-Ten said, "What color
and how big?"</P><P>"Umm the whole back in black please."</P><P>"Okay I'll go tell my mommy!"</P><P>Naruto watched his only friend his age
run off. He smiled. 'At least I have one friend!' He ran off to
find Kyuubi waiting for him by the door with his robe in her hands
and bags on his shoulders. She was conversing with a fairly plump
lady who must've been Ten-Ten's mother. Ten-Ten was sitting on
the counter next to them playing with some yarn (A/N-Note she is not
a cat but I didn't think a seven year old Ten-Ten would be
sharpening Kunai yet,). She looked up and saw him coming over and
smiled.</P><P>As Naruto and Kyuubi were leaving the
store Ten-Ten ran over and hugged him.</P><P>"Bye Naruto! Come back anytime!"
She whispered to him in a caring but yet oddly assertive voice. He
blushed so madly he looked like Hinata.</P><P>"S-Sure." He replied with a
stutter. Kyuubi picked up on it and smirked.</P><P>"Lets go kit, I mean kid. We still
need to pick up our camping supplies and other items as well. Hurry
up so we can leave already!"</P><P>Naruto scampered over to Kyuubi as she
left the store. Soon they'd be on the way to a great adventure.</P><P><B>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</B></P><P>They walked up to the survival store
that most ninjas tend to the "sadistic" person that sells the
wares at the store. It didn't help that she was considered a
torture and interrogation expert. She was none other than Anko
Mitarashi. Naruto gulped. He had heard of this woman before and he
knew she was crazy. The sign read Mitarashi's Poison and Survival
Store.</P><P>As they entered they heard a snoring
sound. There splayed out on the counter was none other than Anko,
sleeping on the job. Kyuubi sighed. She then sniffed the air. It
<I>reeked</I> of snakes.</P><P>'<B>Naruto be careful of this one.
She smells like the one who made me attack the village.'</B></P><P>'Okay thank you for the warning.'</P><P>Naruto poked Anko awake with a stick.
She awoke with a growl and snapped the stick with her fingers. Naruto
just stood there impassive to the whole thing. She grinned with a
sense that made you get the feeling not her whole brain was there.
She rolled of the desk and made her way over to the two. She threw a
kunai, attempting to nick the check of Naruto but it seemed as if an
invisible appendage had stopped it. She frowned at this. (A/N:
Naruto's tails are like arms.)</P><P>"Excuse me miss but me and my younger
companion are here to purchase some traveling items. Oh and possibly
some poison used on a short sword about this long…" Naruto spaced
out after this like he usually did. Instead of paying attention he
decided to wander through the store. There were vials of poisons and
antidotes all over the place. He tripped and fell landing on a very
irritated dog. Actually three irritated dogs. He gulped when thy came
at him with their teeth barred. Then the one Naruto presumed the
leader sniffed the air and barked to the other two dogs. They all
became softer in expression and lunged at Naruto licking him on the
face and arms. He giggled uncontrollably. This continued until a
certain Inuzuka called the dogs off.</P><P>"Sorry about that." She said while
rubbing her head sheepishly. She was pretty. She was at least three
years older than Naruto. (A/N: I'm making Hana older in this
fic.)"Truthfully they usually bite everyone they come across but
they seem to like you! I'm Hana, Inuzuka Hana." She extended a
hand, which Naruto took gratefully.</P><P>"I'm Naruto, Uzamaki Naruto."
Getting up he grinned at her sheepishly which she laughed at. The
three puppies were barking at jumping at Naruto. He leaned down and
picked one up. It licked at his face joyfully. He laughed and put it
back down. They walked together back to the counter, where a boy who
looked the same as Hana, and an older woman who also looked like Hana
were talking to Anko.</P><P>"Do you know that scary lady."
Naruto whispered to Hana.</P><P>"No but my mom does. She and her go
way back or something." She whispered back.</P><P>"Oh that explains it."</P><P>"Naruto? Oh Naruto there you are come
on we are going! We can leave now we have everything we need!"
Kyuubi called over to Naruto.</P><P>"Okay. Well Hana I have to go on a
long training trip! I'll see you maybe when I get back!"</P><P>"When will that be?"</P><P>"Kyu-I mean Akane said when I'm 16
so see you then!" Naruto yelled after leaving the store. Hana was
downtrodden. She had finally made a friend around her age and yet he
had to go away for a whole frigging decade! This sucked!</P><P>Kyuubi and Naruto shouldered on their
backpacks. It was time to leave. Naruto took a deep breath and walked
out of the gates for the first time.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>AN</P><P>Quick Question which will make this fic
completely different.</P><P>ONE- We can have a timeskip to him at
13 coming back early b/c of Akatsuki. Flashbacks will explain things
that seem like they are our of place.</P><P>TWO- We can have one long story of
adventures but id hate writing that but u guys decide. (sorry for
grammar)</P><P>I prefer ONE but whatever you want I
will do.</P><P>-RfKeNn</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer: I don't own anything
except my computer on which I type this.</P><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</P><P><B>Six Years Later…</B></P><P>A now 13-year-old Naruto walked through
the door flanked on wither side by two very beautiful women. One was
Kyuubi in her all of her glory. Her red hair fluttered behind her as
a gust of wind blew past.</P><P>On the other side of Naruto was a
blonde haired woman, who by the looks of things was a runaway nin
from Kumo, her name, Yugito Nii. She appeared to be at least two
years older than Naruto, making her 15. She had a ponytail that
reached past her lower back which was bandaged to prevent it from
coming loose and hindering her movements.</P><P>Naruto himself was different. Now at
the height of 5'7", he was tall for his age. He still donned the
same battle robe as before, cherishing it, as it was his first gift
from Kyuubi and his first gift really in his entire life. Strapped to
his back in an "X" shape was his twin wakizashi. His hair was
long and pulled back into a ponytail that reached the middle of his
back. Underneath his robe he had blood red ANBU pants and a fishnet
shirt. There were numerous pockets for kunai and shuriken. He looked
at his companions with his cerulean blue eyes. They were now rimmed
with a dark red, another gift from Kyuubi. It was a Kekkei Genkai, a
Dojutsu to be specific. The Fox's Eye allowed a person to see
different heat levels within a specific area. This came in handy
during night reconnaissance, as you did not have to expose yourself
to see different heat levels.</P><P>The second ability of the Fox's Eye
is the ability to create fire from thin air. As this was a special
type of fire, known as Fox's Fire, it did not hurt the maker of the
fire. It would create a suit of armor around his body, impenetrable
by fire or wind but vulnerable to water.</P><P>The third and last ability of his
dojutsu is the ability to communicate with a fox companion, much like
an Inuzuka clan member.</P><P>Thinking of the Inuzuka clan reminded
him of a certain girl he had met years prior to his departure. Little
did he know, that this very same girl was thinking of him across town
at this moment...</P><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</P><P>Hana was bored. Hell she'd be dead if
you could die from such a thing. Hana was quite sure you could but it
just hadn't happened yet and she wasn't willing to let herself
become the first to expire of such a thing. She willed herself from
her spot against the wall of her family's kennel. Her loyal dogs,
now three times as big, were lying at her feet. She went over and
scratched the lead dog's ear.</P><P>Suddenly all three dog's heads shot
up and he or she barked simultaneously. What they said was unclear
but she could tell they were happy. The dogs then got to their feet
and charged out the door of the kennel. Hana, shocked, ran out after
them.</P><P>'<I>Judging by the direction of the
dogs, whatever excited them is either at or on their way to the
Hokage Tower. Well whatever it is, I'll find out soon enough'</I></P><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</P><P>An exhausted Ten-Ten was trudging to
the Hokage tower in order to give a mission report. She had just come
from an excruciatingly tiring mission involving old men, ducks and a
whole lot of cheese. She shuddered at the memories.</P><P>'<I>I never thought an old man could
do that with his ears'</I> she thought to herself. Just as she was
reminiscing about her recent mission, three brown blurs shot past
her. The speed at which these blurs were traveling made Ten-Ten fall
on her butt and blink. She looked up dazed to see a very irritated
Hana chasing after them, yelling obscenities.</P><P>'<I>Whatever happened to make her
this irritated must be big. Perhaps I should follow. It seems as if
they are heading the same way as me anyways.</I>' Done
contemplating, she got up and jogged toward the Hokage tower, where
the blurs, Hana and the third would be waiting for the reason of the
disturbance.</P><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</P><P>Naruto was about to enter the Hokage
Tower after his companions, being the chivalrous gentleman he was he
let them go first, when three brown blurs crashed into him. At first
he thought he was being attacked but when no pain came he looked
again. On his chest, pinning him to the ground was the same puppy (if
you could call it that) from the poison shop six years ago. Happily
he sat up and rubbed behind the dog's ears when he heard a very
disgruntled voice.</P><P>"Shari, Shuma and Suki! Explain to me
why you ran of-" She stopped when she saw exactly what, or should
she say who, her dogs were after. She saw a very sheepish looking
Naruto and three very sheepish dogs in a pile in front of the
Hokage's Tower. Hana was flabbergasted at the young man before her.</P><P>"Naruto? Is that really you!?!"
Hana shrieked.</P><P>"Yeah it is Hana-Chan, it's really
good to see- grggh" He was cut off by a suffocating hug by Hana.
She pulled him into her bosom and was in the process of cracking his
limbs when a winded Ten-Ten appeared.</P><P>Ten-Ten, immediately recognizing the
robe her mom had embroidered years ago, let her jaw drop to the
floor. Her earliest child friend whom she had only seen once in her
life was back in town. She quickly joined the hug with a squeal of
"Naruto-kun!"</P><P>Naruto hadn't ever had emotions such
as the ones he was having right now. On one hand he was having the
life squished out of him. On the other hand he was placed in the
well-endowed chest of Hana, which he was enjoying greatly.
Unfortunately for him, he needed air so he was forced to pry himself
out of the grip of the two beautiful girls. He hadn't noticed the
glares Yugito and Kyuubi had given Ten-Ten and Hana but the girls
themselves had. They glared right back, with just as much ferocity,
if not more than the jinchuuriki and demon.</P><P>"So Naruto-<I>kun</I>, how long have
you been back in town?" asked Ten-Ten, adding the emphasis on the
suffix of the name.</P><P>"Oh, I just got in today. Apparently
the Hokage couldn't have me outside city walls so he had to recall
my companions and myself back to Konoha." Naruto replied casually.</P><P>"So you will be staying in Konoha for
awhile then?" This time it was Hana asking.</P><P>"Yeah me Yugito-Chan and Kelsey-Chan
will be staying in Konoha until the heat passes."</P><P>"Well that's great! Maybe we could
hang out some time?" Ten-Ten asked.</P><P>"Yeah that'd be great! Well see you
guys I have to go talk to the old man!" Naruto followed his friends
inside the Hokage Tower up the stairs. As they reached the
secretary's desk they stopped and knocked on the door. A faint
"<I>come in"</I> was heard. Naruto opened the door to a smiling
Sarutobi.</P><P>"Naruto! Come boy sit! Oh this must
be Yugito-san and Kelsey-Chan as well?"</P><P>"Yeah. Old man we both know
formalities weren't what I was called back for. If you care to
explain why I was called back so I may find a place to stay while I
am amongst Konoha."</P><P>"Yes I will. Now you know that there
are others like you from Kelsey. Yugito you yourself are one of them.
You two though are half of the remaining jinchuuriki. You Naruto,
Yugito, the seven tails and the eight tails are the only four that
remain. Why is this you may ask? It is because of a group named
Akatsuki. They hunt down and extract the Bjuu from within a
jinchuuriki. All of them are targeted none are safe. We have the
identities of all but the leader of the group. One of our own, an
Uchicha Itachi, is amongst there group. He may seem as if he is
against us but in truth he is not."</P><P>"Old man, I know of the Uchicha
massacre and who committed it. How is he with us?"</P><P>"I am ashamed to say I ordered the
killing of the Uchicha clan." At this news the whole room was shook
with an eerie silence. Naruto could only accept this fact. What was
done, is done and nothing could change the past…yet.</P><P>"For what reason" Naruto asked.</P><P>"There was a coup d'état on my
position as Hokage involving the Uchicha clan. Apparently they had
recruited the help of Stone and Mist Nin to help. The only way to end
this was to find a loyal Uchicha and use him to exterminate the
plotting ones. He only spared the life of one and one body is yet to
be recovered. There is his younger brother Sasuke and the one missing
body, presumed dead is an Uchicha Mikoto (sp?). Now I want to
continue with Akatsuki." Receiving a nod from Naruto he continued.
"Now that we have cleared that up, if you ever come across him and
his partner, eliminate his partner and tell him he is relieved from
duty. He is to return to Konoha and continue his service to our
village. This is a double SS-rank mission and you will be paid as
such. Now Naruto what rank are you skill wise? I will have to start
you as a Genin to be fair but I wish to have a basic idea of your
skill."</P><P>"I am most likely a Jounin if not
higher. I know over 1,000 jutsu including the rasengan. I have a
feral type of taijutsu much like the one of an Inuzuka, which
involves my fox partner, Koji. I am also trained in my dojutsu, the
Fox's Eye, which enhances my taijutsu. My genjutsu is moderate but
my knowledge on kinjutsu is vast."</P><P>Sarutobi smirked. "I knew you had a
dojutsu but I didn't think it would benefit you this much. But I
must tell you one more thing before you leave. Since you have a
Kekkei Genkai, you must take multiple wives. I will not tell you how
many but you will have to take more than one."</P><P>Naruto paled at this. He knew he was a
hit among the woman. Hell Kyuubi would've molested him countless
times if he hadn't put his foot down.</P><P>"This means I need to build a clan?
That would involve me having a clan compound which I have no money to
buy one. And then there is th-" Sarutobi cut him off with a quick
raise of his fingers.</P><P>"Don't worry about that. You'll
move into the old Nazimake clan house."</P><P>"Okay than."</P><P>"Oh and Naruto, report to the academy
tomorrow to be placed on your team. You will probably be promoted
quickly but still you need the experience."</P><P>Naruto just grunted and leapt from the
window, Yugito and Kyuubi in tow. When they had gotten to the street
the third had indicated the clan house was on they were surprised to
find that their neighbors were none other than the Hyuuga clan.
Naruto joked about greeting their neighbors and Naruto's question
was greeted with two quick no's followed by a massive sweat-drop.</P><P>The first step on to the property was
exhilarating for Naruto. He had never had a real home before.
Sleeping in cold damp caves with only Kyuubi to keep him warm wasn't
a real home. But now, now he had a real home. Tears were in the brims
of his eyes as he reached the doorstep and turned the handle. As he
pushed forward warm air rushed out to him. There was a fire already
lit, probably a jutsu of some sort. That gave the house a warm
feeling. Naruto could tell that the house was old and vast just by
stepping in it.</P><P>"We should probably just find three
rooms and settle in and I'll leave exploring to you two tomorrow as
I meet my team." Naruto said as they walked up the stairs to find
suitable rooms.</P><P>Naruto found a room that must've been
to the clan head before him. He thought it only fitting since this is
what he was now. A large king-sized bed with black sheets and
blankets covered with red symbols of Konoha was centered in the
middle of the room. There were two doors, one a large bathroom and
the other a walk in closet. There was one more door, Naruto opened
and pushed into a built on room, which was smaller but more
decorative. It had armor and swords of every shape and size that hung
on the walls. Naruto traced his hands along a katana of jet black
next to a red battle armor of some sort. He knew at this moment he
was home. As Naruto went into the hallway he noticed that Kyuubi had
yet to pick out a room.</P><P>"Kyuubi aren't you going to pick
out a room?"</P><P>"Umm, Naruto-kun I was
wondering…could we possibly share a room? It would be like the
caves when we traveled. I'm so used to having you with me while I
sleep I'm not sure I could sleep alone anymore." Kyuubi then
activated Puppy Eye Jutsu, which made Naruto waver and give in.</P><P>"Okay Kyuubi-chan. I would be happy
to share a room with you."</P><P>As Naruto was saying these words
Kyuubi's face lit up and she completely glomped Naruto into the
room and some how also miraculously closed the door at the same time.
Naruto and Kyuubi both changed into their pajamas and when Naruto
offered to sleep on the floor, Kyuubi wouldn't have it.</P><P>"No Naruto-kun, we are <I>both</I>
sleeping on this bed! Nothing will happen…unless you want it to."
At this she swayed her hips and slid into the bed with a dazed Naruto
following closely behind. Naruto slipped into the bed only to find
that Kyuubi had made his chest her pillow. He sighed continently. He
was home.</P><P>"Goodnight Naruto-<I>kun</I>"
Kyuubi whispered into Naruto's answer.</P><P>"Goodnight Kyu-<I>chan</I>" Naruto
whispered back.</P><P>They both slipped into a dreamless
sleep.</P><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</P><P>Naruto was early to class. He had used
the Chameleon Jutsu to cover himself. The first person that had
walked in was a Hyuuga. She was pretty but her posture showed lack of
confidence. She sighed and sat herself next to where Naruto was
sitting. For a second she tensed but she then relaxed as more
students started to walk in. Naruto let out a low inaudible whistle
and suddenly a blood red fox raced through the door to where Naruto
was sitting. He was the size of a full-grown retriever. Naruto
released his jutsu, and was happy to see that he had only caught the
attention of the class Inuzuka. His ninken was in his hood and was
looking at his fox with intense curiosity.</P><P>A man, presumed in his twenties with a
long scar walked in.</P><P>"All right class, settle down. Settle
down kids. I SAID SETTLE DOWN YOU FUCKING MAGGOTS!" Yelled the man.</P><P>"Sorry Iruka-sensei." They all
chimed back.</P><P>"Now today there will be a new person
joining us. Is an Uzamaki Naruto here?"</P><P>"Present." Said Naruto slumped over
in his seat with a half-hearted wave. The entire class turned and
looked at him. Most people were unimpressed and took him as just
another wannabe ninja. There were some however who decided to watch
him closely. Among these were Sasuke, Shino, Shikamaru and Hinata.
The first three were because they considered him a possible threat.
The last was because there was a steady stream of blood coming from
her nose, along with a dazed look on her face.</P><P>'<I>The things I could do…'</I>
Hinata's attention snapped back to Iruka as he started reading out
the teams.</P><P>(<B>AN SAME TEAMS AS ANIME/MANGA)</B></P><P>"Right now wait for your sensei here.
Ja ne!" Iruka went up in a puff of smoke as he left.</P><P>The teams disappeared one by one as
their sensei came and took them to various locations. Finally after
an hour of waiting, Naruto realized that this would be a good time
for bonding with his companion Koji.</P><P>'Koji'</P><P>'Yes Naruto?'</P><P>'What do you make of my team?'</P><P>'Well it looks like you have an emo
loser and a fan girl. It's a lose-lose situation.'</P><P>'Thanks for being so positive about
my future' Sarcasm dripping with every word.</P><P>Koji let out a fox's version of a
chuckle, which sounded like a low growl. This alerted both Sakura and
Sasuke. Sakura was the first to question the fox.</P><P>"Ano, Naruto-kun what's with the
fox?" she asked genuinely curious. Sasuke was obviously just as
curious but wouldn't let it ruin his cool demeanor.</P><P>"Well Haruno-<I>san</I> he is my
fighting companion like a ninken is to an Inuzuka. He is my friend
along with my partner. He isn't a pet. That is an insult t him and
me, so don't go calling him that. If you do make a move to insult
him or me, you will die by my hands Haruno." Naruto replied with
certain venom in his voice.</P><P>Sakura was taken aback and was about to
retort when a lazy looking one-eyed Jounin walked in.</P><P>"My first impression of you is…weak
annoying brats. Meet me up on the roof in five minutes." He poofed
away in a swirl of leaves leaving very agitated children. Naruto did
the same as Kakashi leaving now a mad Sasuke and a curious Sakura to
walk up the stairs.</P><P>When the others arrived they stood in a
circle on the roof.</P><P>"Okay kiddies my name is Kakashi and
I'm your Jounin sensei. Now please introduce yourselves."</P><P>"Umm, sensei could you introduce
yourself to show us how its done?" Sakura asked in a "cute"
manner.</P><P>"Sure thing pinkie," this cause
Sakura to become red with anger," My name is Kakashi I have many
likes I dislike some things too and I have hobbies. My dream
is…unimportant. Now for you Pinkie."</P><P>All three had the same thoughts running
through their heads '<I>We only found out his name'</I>.</P><P>Sakura stood up straighter, and cleared
her throat. "Well, my name is Haruno Sakura, and-"</P><P>"Sasuke, Sasuke, and anything that's
not Sasuke!" Naruto interrupted, an impish grin on his face.</P><P>"Hey!" Sakura bristled. "Sensei!
He interrupted me!"</P><P>"Well, you did kind of interrupt him
first."</P><P>"So? He already went, remember?"</P><P>Kakashi gave her a blank look. "He
already went? I don't recall that."</P><P>"Whatever!" Sakura huffed, looking
away from her infuriating teacher.</P><P>After a few seconds of strange silence,
Sakura turned back to see her sensei giving her an expectant glance.</P><P>"What <I>now</I> sensei?"</P><P>"Aren't you going to correct him?"</P><P>"Umm...what?" Sakura eloquently
responded.</P><P>"Naruto. He said your goal was Sasuke
your likes were...Sasuke, and your dislikes</P><P>Were...what was it Naruto?"</P><P>Ever helpful, Naruto responded,
"Anything that's not Sasuke, sir."</P><P>"Good man." He turned back to
Sakura. "So? Was he wrong?"</P><P>The blush on Sakura's face, and the
fact that she looked at everything <I>except</I> Sasuke told Kakashi
all he needed to know.</P><P>"So Fox-boy you next."</P><P>"My name is Naruto Uzamaki. My likes
are Kelsey-chan, gardening and training. My hobbies are training and
cooking. My hates are the people who want me killed and the people
who think that they are better than me."</P><P>"Okay… now Mr. Personality."</P><P>Sasuke glared at his "teacher". "My
name is Sasuke Uchicha. I have no likes, I dislike almost everything
and I only have one dream. To kill a certain person."</P><P>"Hmm, well meet me at training ground
7 at 9 A.M. tomorrow and don't eat anything or you'll throw up.
Ja ne!" Kakashi left in a plume of smoke. Naruto jumped off the
roof and made his way home. Tomorrow was going to be a
loooooooooooooooong day.</P>
