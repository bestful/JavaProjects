He had one of the most goofiest grins on his as he jumped from roof to roof .</P><P>he was Naruto Uzumaki and today was the best day ever!</P><P>Last month he and his team had finally gotten back his brother from that evil snake. No one believed him that his brother didn't go on his own free will. So he had to prove it!</P><P>And in the end he did. Now being reunited with his brother Sasuke Uchiha, was something he trained for three years.</P><P>You see when the curse mark was placed on Sasuke by Orochimaru, Sasuke lost control over his body. He still had his soul being forced to watch himself hurting his friends and it was truly hell. But Naruto never gave up hope on him.</P><P>After they successfully rescued Sasuke the team was not allowed to take missions due to the fact Sasuke needed time and friends to recover from the remove of the curse seal.</P><P>Now they were allowed to take on a inner village mission but a mission none the less</P><P>He was going to meet the rest of team 7 there and when he meant the rest he meant everyone including and Sai.</P><P><i>I wonder what mission we are going to have? </i>Naruto thought to himself. He was hopping for the Tora cat mission again so he could finally get revenge!</P><P><b>Kit you have cat issues. You know that right? </b> Came a dark voice form the deepest part of his brain. The nine tails was grinning at the happiness surrounding Naruto. They had grown a great relation.</P><P>The closes either had about father or son</P><P><i>I know. But it doesn't matter! We finally get a mission! I can't wait! </i> Jumping to the front of the hokage tower he grinned as he walked in. the desk lady smiled at him and let him pass without a hitch</P><P>As he walk up the stairs he could feel the chakra of his team. All waiting for him, hey even Kakashi was there before him!</P><P>Opening the door Naruto grinned at the others in greeting . Sakura smiled at him before going back at staring at Sasuke. Who nodded his head to his brother.</P><P>Yamato and Sai gave a short nod while Kakashi never looked up from his book. Once that they all got quite and lined up in front of the Fifth Hokage Lady Tsunade.</P><P>Tsunade looked at everyone before picking up the mission and read to them.</P><P>"okay team 7 your mission is to help a new member to the leaf village. She was found at the valley of death and-"</P><P><b>AHHHHHHH! RUN! NARUTO RUN! RUN FOR YOUR LIFE! </b> Kyu suddenly screamed in Naruto's head. Scaring the hell out of the poor boy. Jumping around looking for anyone who looked like a threat</P><P><i>Kyu! What's wrong? What is it?</i> Naruto asked still trying to locate the threat. Sadly Kyuubi was to busy screaming ti answer him</P><P><b>NO! SHE'S COMING!</b> Kyu screamed hiding as far back as he could in his cell. He curled up in a ball with fear written all over his face.</P><P>Naruto saw the door opening and was starting to sweat. What could be so horrible than to scare the NINE TAILS FOX?!</P><P>As the doors fully swung open there stood a girl with long black hair reaching her mid thigh. Her face was framed with 9 strips of red. she was as tall as Sakura.</P><P>Wearing a ninja black shirt with the sleeves cut off. Under it was a long sleeve net shirt ending at his elbows and black baggy pants. She had a beanie covering the top of her head. And fingerless black gloves.</P><P>On her back was a long sword and a weapons patch on her hip. Her head band tied at her waist like a belt.</P><P>She was also the reason Naruto and Sasuke were on the ground passed out from a noose bleed</P><P><b>NOOO! ITS TO LATE! WHY!? NOT MY KIT! NOT MY KIIIIITTTT! </b>Kyuubi screamed as the outside world began to darken from Naruto's faint.</P>
