That means English spelling for things, English nicknames, and no Japanese honorifics. This is for no other reason than 'for fun'...cause I actually like the English dub. Except for 'Kyuubi'. That's easier to see as a name than 'Nine Tails'. Though maybe I'll have Naruto call him that ('Nine Tails') until he finds out his name of course.</p><p>Please enjoy anyway!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>IthurtsIthurtsitHURTS!</p><p>And it would stop hurting if that slippery bastard would just die already.</p><p>Him, with the red hair and the piercings on his face. He needed to die so that the pain could end.</p><p>But this stupid rock was holding him back! He needed to get loose. He needed to unleash all of his power and get loose! He needed to…stop and wonder what this feeling is. Why it felt like he was about to...</p><p>Throw up?</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>It was at that point that the eight-tailed beast inside of the giant rock trashed about, roaring in clear confusion and pain. Pain stared up unemotionally at it, but his eyes were filled with weariness. Just what was the beast doing now? And would it affect things in the future?</p><p>His eyes widened when the eight-tailed kitsune started to glow red and he quickly ducked for cover when there was a blinding red light that brought a painful burn to the land. For a few minutes as Pain hid behind a sturdy rock, the air around him burned and it was too bright to even keep his eyes opened. Good thing this was technically a dead body he controlled.</p><p>Elsewhere Sakura, Neji, Tenten, and the Hyuuga bodyguard Koh, stood around Hinata's injured body. Sakura was doing her best to heal her and it appeared to be working. But then Neji, who was staring concernedly at Hinata, abruptly looked up and with his byakugan activated, saw a dangerous red chakra heading straight towards them. Fast.</p><p>"We need to get out of here!" He shouted.</p><p>"But Hinata isn't fully healed yet!" Sakura replied as she kept healing the Hyuuga heiress. Off close by there was a large toad and next to him was a shivering Katsyuua.</p><p>"Neji Hyuuga is right Sakura. Something happened to Naruto! We need to get out of here quickly!"</p><p>"What?" Sakura exclaimed. <i>'Naruto…'</i> She thought concerned as she paused in healing Hinata and stared in the direction of her friend. She was broken out of her trance when Tenten grabbed her arm.</p><p>"Don't <i>you</i> think about recklessly running into danger too!" She exclaimed pulling Sakura to her feet. Sakura saw Neji had picked up Hinata and was carrying her in his arms.</p><p>"But-" She started looking in the direction of Naruto once more. She didn't know where Kakashi was. Sasuke was still a traitor. Naruto was all she had right now and the last thing she wanted to do was stand aside while something was happening to him. But the ANBU who was stationed there appeared in front of her.</p><p>"You are Lady Tsunade's apprentice aren't you? We need your skill to keep helping to heal the injured. We can't have you putting yourself in danger. If it needs to be said, it looks like that Naruto kid has gotten a lot stronger. I'm sure he'll be fine."</p><p>Sakura didn't necessarily believe this ANBU who had never seen her teammate in action until now.</p><p>"Katsuyaa?"</p><p>"I can't tell you what's going on. It's all a big blur of red and I don't know what. But I can feel that Naruto's still alive," the slug answered.</p><p>Sakura hesitated. The red worried her but if Katsuyaa said Naruto was still alive then that was good. The ANBU was right that Naruto was a lot stronger than he used to be. Hopefully, she was just underestimating him.</p><p>"Sakura we have to go," Neji pointed out looking worriedly at the fast coming chakra.</p><p>The pink-haired medic nodded her head and then winced in pain when she felt the air around her burn. The others winced and grunted in pain as well.</p><p>"This…pain…what is up with the air?" Tenten gasped out. Neji gritted his teeth.</p><p>"It's chakra! We have to get out before we burn!" he pointed out. In his arms Hinata whimpered.</p><p>"Lady Hinata!" He called out to his cousin in worry. Gamakichi quickly turned his back towards them.</p><p>"Hurry up and get on my back! I'll take you all to safety! This heat isn't affecting me that much," the toad said. It was true that his skin was much tougher than the humans' skin, but honestly he didn't know how much longer his added toughness would last him against this burn.</p><p>All of the humans nodded and quickly clambered onto the toad before he hopped away to safety.</p><p>Back at the battlefield, Pain was barely keeping himself together in this heat. He was burning chakra as well using an Almighty Push just to keep the bulk of the heated chakra away from him. He wondered if he would run out and have to retreat when the chakra suddenly stopped moving around him.</p><p>He was confused and tense for a few seconds as he opened his eyes and saw the red chakra sit eerily still. He kept his jutsu up and it turned out to be a good idea for the chakra suddenly blew back against him towards the source. The pressure was pushing against his Almighty Push and his arms were shaking just trying to keep the jutsu up. His vision became a blur of red but at least the heat didn't hurt his eyes anymore.</p><p>Finally, after what felt like minutes, all of the chakra was behind him. He released the jutsu and took a couple of seconds to breathe heavily and regain his breath. Things weren't looking too good for him. He felt too drained after all of that. He had no idea how he would keep up against the Kyuubi jinchuuriki now. But he had to try at least. Failure wasn't an option and as long as he still had chakra, even a little, it would stay that way.</p><p>Pain slowly and carefully turned his body around and peaked behind the rock. He was shocked by what he saw.</p><p>The red chakra was flickering about crazily, but it also seemed to be compressing into one form. Underneath all of the chakra, lying down between the rubble of the rock that once held him at bay was the shadowy form of what had to be the Kyuubi jinchuuriki. It was too dark and the chakra too bright to make out the detailed characteristics, but Pain was sure it was him because who else could it be?</p><p>But now there was the question of what the chakra was doing. It wasn't forming around the boy like Pain thought it should. Instead, it was forming <i>on top</i> of the body. Whatever was going on was certainly going to be trouble for Pain. He thought about sending an Almighty Push in the direction of the chakra in an attempt to stop it from doing whatever it was it was doing, but Pain was low on chakra. And this chakra had to be the volatile chakra of the Kyuubi no Kitsune itself. There was little doubt in Pain's mind that an Almighty Push against that would do him little, if any good.</p><p>All he could do was sit behind his incredibly sturdy rock and watch helplessly as the chakra formed. He had so many ideas in his head about what the chakra could be doing, but none of them could even come close to what actually happened.</p><p>Pain's eyes widened and his jaw slackened in shock as the chakra took on a human form. Even after all the abuse his eyes have gone through already, Pain could clearly see that was definitely a man, or at least a teenager as the build seemed to be the same as the Kyuubi jinchuuriki, squatting on top of the Kyuubi jinchuuriki's body.</p><p>The volatile chakra was simmering down as more and more went into the figure before finally, it was all gone. With its disappearance Pain could finally start to make out what the figure looked like.</p><p>He paled when he saw a curtain of red hair, tan skin, and dark whisker marks.</p><p>And when the figure raised his(it was <i>definitely</i> a 'he') head and Pain's Rinnengan met blood red eyes with slitted pupils, Pain knew he was fucked.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Did you like it? I feel it's different than how I've written before but I'm not sure lol.</p><p>For those of you who read my other stories FEAR NOT! I actually have the half of 'From A to Z''s H done and half of chapter 5 for TINL done. And...something I shouldn't say because it's a surprise :)!</p><p>EDIT: I am officially doing this by myself :P.</p><p>Edit 2: Revised to get rid of typos and make things flow better.</p><p>So let me know what you think so far!</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p>And finally here's chapter 2!</p><p>Sorry it took so long. But I hope you at least enjoy this!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Pain had no time to react. He had seen the creature glance at the Kyuubi jinchuuriki and only closed his eyes to blink when he found himself slammed onto the ground on his back.</p><p>There was a large hand wrapped around his neck squeezing so tightly that Pain found it incredibly hard to talk. He gasped and brought his own hands up to push away the hand around his neck and while doing so opened his eyes.</p><p>It was very rare for Pain to feel fear. There was only the fear of his dreams of true peace never coming true. But…</p><p>There is the fear of your dream failing.</p><p>And then there's <i>this</i> kind of fear.</p><p>The naked man was looking down at him. His face was shadowed by his long, red hair, but that only made his red eyes glow eerily. His completely white, large, and incredibly-sharp looking fangs stretched across his face in a wide and insane-looking grin. When he spoke, his deep voice made all of Pain's insides freeze.</p><p>"<b>So you have a rinnegan? Haven't seen one of those in a </b><i><b>long</b></i><b> time."</b></p><p>Pain gasped out loud as the pressure around his neck increased and the man swiftly lowered his head so that his mouth was right beside his ear.</p><p>"<b>However, you are nowhere near </b><i><b>his</b></i><b> level."</b></p><p>Pain had to remind himself that he wasn't literally in any danger. That the real him was away, safely tucked in a secure location with Konan. But those damn chakra receivers made it hard for him to remember that. It was also hard for him to remember that he could not feel physical pain with this body. He could only feel it start to cook and quickly cremate as the man on top of him released a burning red chakra onto him.</p><p>Panicked. He felt panic. Failure wasn't supposed to ever be an option with him. He never lost a battle. But this man, this <b>demon</b>, was holding him down and burning his body and making him feel fear for the first time since Yahiko's true death. It was pure instinct that drove him to retaliate. Otherwise he would've sat there and done nothing.</p><p>"ALMIGHTY PUSH!" He shouted holding his hands in front of him. He had his eyes closed for the first few seconds, because he was exerting all he could. He pulled up a lot of chakra for this one. But when he opened his eyes he was horrified to see that the only thing moving was the man's hair which was being pushed back into the air; looking like a river of fine red silk. His mouth was shut firmly in a frown and two small fangs peaked out on his top lip over his bottom one. His red eyes were half-lidded with boredom. He was unaffected by Pain's devastating technique.</p><p>A second later the boredom turned into annoyance as he snarled fiercely and pumped more burning chakra out. It wasn't long before Pain couldn't feel the lower half of the body. He stopped the useless jutsu as his body was slowly cremating from his feet up. He stared into burning red eyes.</p><p>Failure wasn't an option. And if he stuck around, it would be the only option. This battle was lost. Nagato had to abandon the body if he wanted another chance. But as he pulled his chakra away, only one thought ran through his mind.</p><p>'<i>Yahiko will never receive a burial worthy of a hero.'</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Kyuubi was confused. He was confused when he opened his eyes and noticed he was not in his cage, but sitting on the brat in a human form. Confusion went away when he noticed the rinnegan user that had been giving his vessel trouble in these past few hours.</p><p>After that there was annoyance. The rinnegan user was good, the damage he did to Konoha was something even Kyuubi could respect. But he wasn't <i>that</i> good. He was nowhere near the level of the Sage of Six Paths. So seeing Naruto was losing to him was a joke. An eye sore.</p><p>But now…he hadn't fully destroyed the body yet. There was still the upper half of his arms and chest and of course head and face. So Kyuubi was confused when the familiar eyes of his once father-figure disappeared and two blank, blue eyes stared back at him.</p><p>Kyuubi wondered if it was a fraud before deciding it really didn't matter as the threat was gone now. Besides there was another matter for him to deal with. Looking behind him he could see that Naruto still hadn't moved from where he laid on the ground. It didn't even look like he woke up.</p><p>He awkwardly crawled on all fours towards his vessel before remembering that humans walked upright. It took him a few seconds to get the hang of standing up on two legs. This body was so strange to him. He had spent over fifty years observing how it worked, but actually using it himself was a different experience entirely.</p><p>It was so different, too different, from his older, much more powerful body. He felt the power in this toned and tanned body, but it could scarcely compare to before. Of course, that was because eight of his nine tails was still in the kid.</p><p>Kyuubi snarled. His will was strong enough to fight off the Fourth when he tried to redo the seal. The seal was weak enough for Kyuubi to let out an entire tail of his chakra along with his mind before the Fourth and Naruto worked together to seal off the rest of him. Why that tail of chakra turned into <i>this</i> Kyuubi couldn't comprehend. He remembered leeching a little off of the kid when he got out, but he had only done that for substance. It took six tails of power for even his bone structure to be formed, so he needed <i>something</i> to help his tail form into a physical body to control. Perhaps when he leeched off of the kid, he accidentally copied his body structure as well.</p><p>Kyuubi scoffed. No matter. He would find a way to make this work and to get his real body back. First he had to reach the kid. He attempted to walk towards Naruto but after tripping ungracefully a few times he finally decided that getting used to the body could wait until after he could be certain that his life and tails were okay. Kyuubi used the speed he used to get to Pain, as it was much easier to use his chakra to propel himself than to walk, and within the second was kneeling by Naruto's side.</p><p>The brat was still breathing of course. Judging by the pull Kyuubi felt from Naruto's stomach, Kyuubi figured that if Naruto stopped breathing, he also would stop as well. And seeing him being tossed around by the lesser rinnegan user was a sad and pathetic sight, but Kyuubi at least knew Naruto wouldn't die from it. He was out of the ridiculous frog form at least. Kyuubi stuck out his tongue in disgust. He didn't know Naruto would even consider relying on those…things when he already had Kyuubi.</p><p>Just further proof that Naruto was just like all the others. He wasn't worthy of being Kyuubi's vessel.</p><p>But for the time being, he was and the only thing Kyuubi could do about that was convince Naruto to release the rest of his power. Obviously since he didn't want to use it he should be more than willing to give it all up. But just in case, Kyuubi should bring some sort of bribery.</p><p>Perhaps the Pain body. Yes he would bring the remains of Konoha's destroyer and tell Naruto that since Kyuubi had killed him and saved Konoha from more death and destruction, Naruto owed him his tails and life back. And how could Naruto decline? If Kyuubi could defeat the rinnegan user when Naruto couldn't, that meant that Naruto's only chance against Kyuubi was using his power.</p><p>And obviously, he wouldn't do that.</p><p>So using what little chakra this body had, Kyuubi formed a tail to stretch out and grab the remains of Deva Path. He then gathered Naruto into his arms and using his speed, searched for a secluded place close to the very edge of the village. When Kyuubi finally became complete again, he wanted to get away from Konoha as fast as possible.</p><p>What Kyuubi didn't realize though, was there was one more living being traveling with him. A blue and white slug clung to Naruto's lower back for the sake of her life. She had only just managed to slip into Naruto's jacket and crawl to Naruto's lower back where Kyuubi's hands weren't touching without him noticing the movement. After that she clung to the boy, not making a single peep. It was Katsuyaa's luck that the beast was too distracted with other things to remember she was there.</p><p>Because she witnessed everything and was going to have to report it. And she didn't know if the day of terror was all over or if the very worst was about to begin.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>And done.</p><p>I apologize for the shortness but I'm trying to get into the hang of writing third person POV like this haha. You can see from my other stories I'm more used to writing with a personal edge to it(I hope you noticed that this story doesn't even have parenthetical thoughts XD...except in the AN heehee).</p><p>Anyways, yeah due to this being practice this chapter is more 'transitional' than anything. I mean some important things happened such as Pain's alternate death. That is important as you can imagine.</p><p>I promise you the remaining chapters will be longer and have much more important content.</p><p><b>Also specific question here</b>, did I do Pain okay? Like the way I had him retreat, it wasn't insulting was it? I wanted to show that Kyuubi was powerful and Nagato knew it which was why he left. But I hope I didn't make him look weak because Nagato will be playing an incredibly important role(Konan will be important too don't worry :P). I looked up Narutopedia too...</p><p>Okay other than that, this story is officially another project I'll work on as TINL finishes up. Wow that gives me...five stories to do XD/ Six including the sequel to Okay. More including the stories in development...LOL this is actually a good thing. If I ever get writer's block for one story(which I doubt haha) I have a bunch of others to help me cure it XD.</p><p>So yeah please let me know what you think!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p>Chapter 3 :)!</p><p>Hurrah for speedy update! Seriously I didn't think I would get to update this until much later. But then I sat down and started writing and just didn't stop haha. And at least it didn't take as long as last time to update. As promised it is longer than chapters 1 and 2.</p><p><i>Anon review reply</i></p><p><i>Sasha Naruto: I understand. I've actually seen Narutopedia make mistakes before(though to be fair they usually are pretty fast at correcting them). But I mainly use it for jutsus, places, names, and all kinds of practical things(you know like what kind of rare flowers exist if I want a character to get something sweet, etc.) I don't think they do too bad on personality, but I don't rely on it for that :). I rely on the manga! But thank you! I will write many chapters haha. This will probably be a longish story.</i></p><p><i>Nami152: HI! YAY it makes me happy to hear you say that :D! I personally believe the KyuuNaru couple in general doesn't get enough love so I'm hoping to fix that. Thank you so much for your kind words! You will see Kyuubi attempt to convince Naruto in this chapter and the title will come into play at some point haha. But not this early ;P. Thank you so much!</i></p><p>Now to the rest, please enjoy!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>It was pure luck that Kyuubi didn't have to go that far. Or perhaps it was the result of all the destruction that cleared a pathway to the nearest cave. Kyuubi didn't care either way.</p><p>Once inside he gently as he could set Naruto down. Not out of any affection, but because it would be easier to convince Naruto to help him if he wasn't whining about being injured. And at the very least knowing that Kyuubi was 'gentle' with him should make him trust the fox a bit more. If it fails though, a knock to the noggin should knock out Naruto's common sense and make him easy to persuade.</p><p>Kyuubi dropped the top half of Deva Pain behind a rock and licked the blood off of his fingers. He could always enjoy the taste of blood. Combine that with the smell of cooked human and Kyuubi was getting really hungry. Alas, with Naruto still asleep he couldn't go anywhere. He didn't want to risk leaving and having Naruto wake up believing he was alone and wander off. No Kyuubi needed to stay until everything was sorted out.</p><p>While waiting for Naruto to get up, the fox decided to try and get used to his body. Although he wanted to be fully confident that Naruto would hand him his power and sever the connection between their lives, he knew his vessel wasn't the most rational human he's ever met. Kyuubi knew better than anyone how emotions cloud his vessel's judgment. There was very little doubt in his mind that Naruto would keep hold of his power just to spite him; especially given what happened in his mind just before he had been partially released. Kyuubi had to be fully prepared to be in this form for a while.</p><p>He first tried experimenting with what he could do with his chakra. Being an all-powerful being made of the stuff, Kyuubi didn't have much need for jutsu. Simply knowing how to unleash blasts of pure, concentrated chakra was enough for him. Luckily, that appeared to be working for him. He gathered chakra at his fingertips and palm, gathered it in the back of his throat, and even gathered it to his ears. Once he was satisfied with that, he experimented more with what changes to his body the chakra could do.</p><p>His nails and teeth were only slightly sharper than the average human's unfortunately, but with a tiny bit of chakra he could make them sharper and lengthen. His ears looked like pointy human ears but chakra made them look exactly like his fox form's ears and he could hear as well as he could in that form as well. The only part of him that the chakra couldn't replicate was his tail. If he pooled chakra at the base of his back where the tail was supposed to go, he only got the chakra tail that Naruto received when he entered the one-tail state.</p><p>After experimenting with his chakra, Kyuubi decided to test the physical aspects. He first tried walking on all fours again, but that was incredibly uncomfortable and he kept accidentally stepping on and pulling his hair. Speaking of which, Kyuubi eyed the long, red locks in disgust. The color matched his fur perfectly; he even had side bangs that were black. But a majority of it was long and red.</p><p>Just like Kushina's hair.</p><p>Just like Mito's hair when she let it down.</p><p>The reminder of his previous jinchuuriki, both of whom he hated with a passion, made his stomach curl in a painful way. If nothing else, he needed to find a way to rid himself of this long hair fast. He was about to lengthen his claws and just cleave off the hair himself, and he didn't care about how it would look, when he heard Naruto groan.</p><p>He immediately looked to see Naruto fidgeting about, trying to sit up. Once he accomplished that he rubbed his head looking incredibly groggy and then suddenly lurched forward as if he was about to throw up. Luckily for Kyuubi's sensitive nose Naruto only dry heaved for a bit. Kyuubi used the extra time to add a little chakra to his voice. It was easy to make deals when your voice sounds 'daunting' and if this body was an almost exact copy of Naruto's then he really needed help with his voice. When Naruto finally got a hold of himself, Kyuubi spoke.</p><p>"<b>If you are done feeling weak now I'd like to talk to you." </b>It wasn't his original voice. But the smooth, deeper sound would do just fine.</p><p>Naruto yelped loudly in surprise and fell back. His eyes widened and his jaw dropped when he saw Kyuubi.</p><p>"Who-Who the hell are you?" He asked in a scratchy voice. Kyuubi's expression melted into a glare.</p><p>"<b>Now that's insulting. You would've recognize anyone of your friends easily in another form, but when it comes to the powerful being that has been there all of your life, you can't tell who he is. Then again you never visit anyway, so what reason could I have to believe you'd recognize me?"</b></p><p>Kyuubi was pleasantly surprised to see recognition appear in Naruto's eyes. It was a bit enlightening to see that even without Kyuubi's mind inside of him to recognize things he couldn't, Naruto was actually sharper than most thought. The fox smirked when Naruto glared at him and shakily stood up on his two legs.</p><p>"<i>You</i>," Naruto's voice was filled with pure disgust which surprised Kyuubi. The blond didn't even speak of Pain's name with such vitriol. Perhaps it stemmed from the fact that Naruto believed Kyuubi was a hateful being that willingly and excitedly brought destruction while that Pain guy kept talking of peace albeit in a mentally unstable manner. Or maybe it could be because of what happened before he got out.</p><p>Kyuubi waited for the angry tirade but was puzzled when Naruto stiffened and started scratching his back. His confusion didn't last long as Naruto immediately pulled out a…slug? Kyuubi's eyes widened. He had forgotten all about that thing.</p><p>"Katsuyaa?" Naruto asked holding the shaking and obviously terrified slug summon.</p><p>"N-Naruto who is thatWhat's going onShould I send for help?Becuase that can't be who I think it isIt just can't!" The slug asked quickly. To Kyuubi it looked like Naruto needed a few seconds to understand what the slug said. When he did his mouth set into a firm line and he looked at Kyuubi with a grim expression. Just to be a tease, Kyuubi grinned back and waved, inwardly laughing Naruto's face showed an expression of hatred.</p><p>Naruto shook his head and turned to Katsuyaa.</p><p>"Katsuyaa I need you to calm down and listen to me alright?" He said calmly. The shivering slug nodded.</p><p>"Please Naruto you must tell me who that is!"</p><p>"First you have to tell me if you told anyone about what has been happening."</p><p>Katsuyaa shook her head. "No not yet. The last thing I told them about was all I could see was a bright red, but you were alright. When the man over there had his chakra release, everyone was in danger due to the burning air. I'm helping them get to safety as we speak."</p><p>"What? You endangered my friends?" Naruto growled at Kyuubi. The fox merely shrugged his shoulders. He wasn't about to defend himself to Naruto. Why should he point out that the brat <i>knew</i> a large amount of Kyuubi's chakra would cause the air to burn? That <i>he</i> was the one who told his friends to stay away in the first place and <i>they</i> obviously didn't listen therefore making it their own fault they were put in danger? Kyuubi cared very little about Naruto's opinion. So it didn't matter at all that once again the brat was blaming <i>him</i> for human faults.</p><p>Naruto, still growling, turned back to Katsuyaa.</p><p>"Are they hurt?"</p><p>"No they're fine. Sakura is with us and she and I have managed to keep everyone healed."</p><p>Naruto sighed in relief. "Good."</p><p>"Now tell me Naruto who is that man? What should I do!"</p><p>"Katsuyaa," Naruto started. "Look I know you're probably going to object but I can't tell you who that is."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"And I want you to keep the fact that he is here a secret."</p><p>"Naruto that's-"</p><p>"Think about it Katsuyaa! We can't let people know. Not this soon. The panic and chaos would be too great and…" Naruto trailed off and only Kyuubi could understand what he was thinking. He knew Naruto was thinking about how as he was Kyuubi's jinchuuriki, he was entrusted with the duty to keep him locked up. Now that he failed that task who knows what the villagers will think of him? They might even forget the role he had in fighting Pain and only focus on the fact that he brought Konoha's worst disaster back to them. He knew that's what Naruto truly feared right now. To Kyuubi, Naruto was such a baby about people's opinions of him.</p><p>But Kyuubi couldn't stop this plan. He too had his reasons for keeping this new development a secret. The main one being that if Konoha found out that he was released and he only had about a tail of his power within him, no doubt they'll gather up their greatest fuinjutsu users to seal him up once more. And without his other eight-tails, as much as it pained him to admit it, Kyuubi didn't believe he'd stand much of a chance against them.</p><p>"Look just trust me okay?" Naruto continued. "I'll handle this. I'll make sure everything will be okay and no more people will be hurt. Okay?"</p><p>"But…" Katsuyaa took a moment to reply before finally sighing and saying, "Alright Naruto. I trust you."</p><p>"Good. Now what I need you to do is go back and be with the others. They'll need your help more than I do."</p><p>Katsuyaa looked unsure until Naruto said, "Please Katsuyaa. I need to talk to this…<i><b>guy</b></i> alone,"</p><p>When Naruto said 'guy' he glared sharply at Kyuubi from the corner of his eye. Kyuubi only stared blankly in return. This anger that Naruto was showing him was cute but it was nothing spectacular. He had seen much stronger anger when he looked in his reflection.</p><p>"Be careful Naruto," the slug warned. Naruto nodded.</p><p>"I will." And with that Katsuyaa disappeared.</p><p>"<b>You really trust her not to tell?"</b></p><p>Naruto ignored Kyuubi's question. Instead he glared at him like he had murdered his parents.</p><p>"You <b>bastard</b>! How the hell did you get out of your cage!" He demanded. Kyuubi chuckled and stood up slowly.</p><p>"<b>Your precious, little father-son team was cute but you'd be surprise how strong the longing for freedom is. When you've been trapped behind bars for the past 16 years or so and your chance to become free is </b><i><b>right there</b></i><b> then you-"</b></p><p>"If this is you trying to get some sort of <i><b>pity</b></i> from me it's not going to work!"</p><p>Now Kyuubi was angry. The absolute last thing he wanted was pity from <b>anyone</b>. His vessel was just like a typical human; so self-centered and judgmental. He glowered harshly at Naruto, taking joy in the fact that he made the blond flinch.</p><p>"<b>I honestly wonder how long you would've survived without me with that mouth of yours. I was simply explaining to you that seeing you and your father trying to redo the seal right in front of me combined with the 16 years I've spent longing for my freedom made my will strong enough to override the feeble, little seal and get my mind and part of my powers out. Your pity is neither needed nor wanted," </b>Kyuubi spat that last sentence out, as if he were revolted Naruto would even consider Kyuubi cared in the least bit. It gave him endless pleasure to see Naruto hesitate when he was called out on his rashness. Funny how he even cares about how a guy he hates sees him. In Kyuubi's opinion, Naruto relied too much on the opinion of others. It made him so weak.</p><p>Naturally, when Naruto got his mind back together in order to answer, Kyuubi didn't get an apology.</p><p>"Well regardless, you're gonna have to get back inside of me. It's too dangerous to have you walking around! You'll kill innocent people!"</p><p>Of course. Naruto hated Kyuubi with a passion but now that he finally has a chance to get rid of him, he doesn't want to take it. Humans were so incredibly selfish, Kyuubi thought in detestation.</p><p>"<b>I actually want to talk to you about that. You see, I have no intention whatsoever to go back into that dreaded seal. However you still have some things that belong to me. Namely eight of my tails. I ask that you give those things back to me and I will leave without a problem."</b>There. Kyuubi even made his offer in a polite manner. But watch how Naruto will still reject him and make it look like he's a bad guy.</p><p>"Are you insane? You think I'm dumb or something? I will NEVER give you the power to do what you did to Konoha again! I would never forgive myself if I let you go and kill innocent people!"</p><p>See? Kyuubi knew his vessel all too well. Ah well, that's why he had back-up plans.</p><p>"<b>You talk as if I'm guaranteed to kill every second. However since I've been out I've only taken one life,"</b> Kyuubi walked up to his trump card behind the rock and picked it up by its hair.</p><p>"<b>I believe this man doesn't count as 'innocent' since he has been causing you trouble right?"</b> Kyuubi held the body up in front of Naruto.</p><p>"WHAT THE FUCK?" Naruto fell back on his body and scrambled away. Kyuubi managed to hold back his laughs but a smile tugged at the corner of his lips. It was funny how Naruto entered the ninja profession and had this kind of reaction to a mutilated body. Then again, it was his first time seeing a body in such a state. Every human freaks out during their 'first time' of anything. It's what made them human. And it's what contributed to the separation between Kyuubi and their kind. Kyuubi never freaked out over anything.</p><p>"What the fuck Kyuubi?" Naruto repeated when he got control over his voice again.</p><p>"<b>This man caused this village a lot of trouble didn't he? The damage is almost to the scale of my attack. Well when I was released I did you and this village a favor and killed him. So now, you owe me," </b>he said. And out of pure callousness, he threw the body to Naruto and inwardly cackled at how his vessel scrambled away from the body and eyed it in a mixture of weariness and terror. He then shakily stood up once more.</p><p>"I-"</p><p>"<b>You owe me. I saved your village and now you owe me my power back."</b></p><p>Naruto took a few deep breaths before staring at Kyuubi. "I-I'm not a samurai!"</p><p>"<b>What?"</b></p><p>"Samurai are those who are big about honor. Although I do care about honor and repaying my debts, I…I'm a ninja and ninja are deceitful!" Naruto shouted pointing at the stunned, but not too surprised Kyuubi. He figured it wouldn't be as easy as it looked getting his power back. Although he couldn't say he wasn't disappointed his plan didn't work in the way he had hoped.</p><p>"You manipulated me in my darkest hour for the sake of your freedom. Your anger takes over my mind and makes me destroy things and hurt people I care about. You can't be trusted! How do I know you're going to 'leave without a problem' when I give you what you want huh? I'd rather keep people safe than be sorry. So I'm not giving you anything!"</p><p>Now Kyuubi was furious. How <b>dare </b>this little child hold hostage what rightfully belonged to him with such a weak excuse.</p><p>"<b>You despicable little</b> <b>fool! You don't even WANT my power! I spent centuries of my life, more years than you could even IMAGINE, to build up all that chakra and I will NOT let some arrogant, self-righteous, know-it-all punk get between me and it! Now you WILL give me back my tails or face my wrath," </b>Kyuubi threatened. Naruto crossed his arms.</p><p>"You threatening me isn't going to make me give you your stuff back," he mocked. Kyuubi longed to reach out and tear his throat. Or no even better, Kyuubi longed to reach out and tear his fingers out. Then tear off his hand. Then his arm. Then he'd do the same with his other limb. Then he'd tear of his toes, then his feet, then his leg, then his thigh. And then he'd do the same with the other. And then when Naruto was a limbless, quivering mess of pain, Kyuubi would look him in the eye and laugh as he stabbed his arm into his stomach where the seal would be. He wanted to make Naruto suffer.</p><p>He was considering leaving Naruto alone after he got his tails and life back. Not out of any affection or thanks to the blond, but because he cared more about going out to enjoy his new freedom than revenge. And it would've been nice to see how freaked out the kid would get not knowing where he was. Naruto would stay up all night waiting for Kyuubi to come back and finish him off. He would feel guilty over letting a monster escape and the guilt would affect his daily life. He would be so psychologically messed up for letting Konoha's greatest enemy go, an enemy that he also happened to hate himself, that he won't forget it for any moment of his life.</p><p>It would always be at the back of his mind, whispering to him and reminding him what a failure of a jinchuuriki he was. Kyuubi wanted that to happen. He was planning on coming back at a later date anyway to finally finish Naruto off.</p><p>But his mind was changed now. The moment he got his power and life back he would end Naruto then and there for good.</p><p>"What's gonna happen anyway? If you don't get your power back? Is a mountain going to be destroyed? Or a tsunami going to be raised?" Naruto asked tauntingly, as if he was teasing Kyuubi over the fact that he didn't have the strength to do those things anymore.</p><p>If he was going to be that way then so be it.</p><p>Kyuubi turned around and started walking out of the cave.</p><p>"<b>I'm going to kill your friends."</b></p><p>That got a reaction from Naruto.</p><p>"What? No you can't!"</p><p>"<b>Watch me."</b></p><p>"I won't let-" And Kyuubi could <i>feel</i> Naruto try to enter the frog mode and at the same time draw a bit of his own chakra when he interrupted him.</p><p>"<b>You didn't even have to strength to defeat that pathetic human," </b>he said pointing to the Pain body. <b>"While </b><i><b>I</b></i><b> took care of him in less than a minute. You can't touch me. The only way you'd stand a chance at stopping me is if you use my power. And I know you won't do something as </b><i><b>demeaning</b></i><b> and </b><i><b>dangerous</b></i><b> as that," </b>he mocked.</p><p>Naruto gritted his teeth and clenched his fist. Kyuubi could tell he was shaking with anger, but he wasn't intimidated in the least bit.</p><p>"<b>Tch,"</b> Kyuubi snorted. <b>"You may have my power under your thumb but you don't have what it takes to control me,"</b> he said walking away. He didn't see Naruto bow his head. Nor did he see Naruto reach into his weapons pouch and grab his kunai.</p><p>"You're right," Naruto said. Kyuubi kept walking, as if he didn't even hear Naruto. Of course he was right. He was the Kyuubi, when was he ever wrong? Especially in regards to Naruto?</p><p>But then he felt something that made his blood freeze.</p><p>Kyuubi whipped around and he paled when he saw Naruto smirking a crazy smirk at him. Right at his neck was his sharpened kunai along with a thin sheet of blood starting to pool out of a shallow cut. Kyuubi glowered.</p><p>"<b>What. The </b><i><b>hell</b></i><b>. Are you </b><i><b>doing</b></i><b>?"</b> Kyuubi whispered dangerously. Naruto never lost that smirk.</p><p>"I don't have what it takes to control you yet," he slightly pressed the kunai to his neck harder making the Kyuubi flinch towards him. "But I can make you stop."</p><p>"<b>YOU FOOL!"</b> Kyuubi growled. <b>"Take that thing away from your neck! Are you crazy?"</b></p><p>"Hm?" Naruto taunted. He teased Kyuubi by slowly shaking his kunai back and forth towards his neck. Kyuubi growled fiercely. Naruto didn't know that their lives were still connected. If he died, Kyuubi still died. He didn't want to tell him that for this very reason and yet the blond imbecile <i>still</i> relied on it! Naruto was playing a dangerous game here. But two can play it that way.</p><p>"<b>You wouldn't dare. You have things to live for Naruto! Don't-"</b> Kyuubi took a step forward only to pause as Naruto clearly pressed the kunai even harder. This time, he wasn't smiling. A chilling glare had settled on his face.</p><p>"<i><b>Don't underestimate me."</b></i></p><p>The meaning was clear to Kyuubi. He shouldn't underestimate what Naruto was willing to do to keep him away from his friends. Kyuubi sneered at Naruto, cursing the blond boy and his own luck at being attached to him. He was literally trembling with anger.</p><p>"What's it going to be Kyuubi? You gonna listen? Or spend more years than I can imagine getting all of that strength back?" Naruto jeered. "Better hurry."</p><p>Kyuubi didn't need to be told that twice. He could see Naruto's skin turn pale and his breath start to slow down with all of the blood coming out of his throat. He could feel his body start to tire out and the edges of his vision start to darken. As long as he had that kunai there in the wound, Kyuubi's chakra couldn't automatically heal him. And he knew Naruto. He knew the blond boy would have no qualms about standing there until they <i>both</i> died.</p><p>Kyuubi cursed the boy to hell and back.</p><p>His shoulders slumped and he let out a sigh of resignation.</p><p>"Good boy," Naruto said pulling the kunai away from his neck. Kyuubi felt his chakra rapidly heal the wound. He could feel Naruto's smug smirk and he felt the irresistible urge to wipe it off of his face. Brutally.</p><p>"<b>Make no mistake boy. I WILL get you back for this</b>," Kyuubi threatened with a dark look on his face.</p><p>Anyone else would've went running for the hill or to their house to write their will. But Naruto met Kyuubi's look with a dark look of his own. They both stood there in complete silence. The hatred, killer intent, and tension in the cave were thick enough that had anyone else been in there they would've found it hard to breathe.</p><p>Finally it was Naruto who broke the silence. Because Kyuubi couldn't think of anything to say that would help him in the least bit.</p><p>"I don't know any sealing techniques. And I'm not going to tell anyone about this."</p><p>"<b>Of course. Don't want anyone knowing you're a failure do you? It's bad enough that the last memory your father will have of the living world is seeing his fuck-up of a son messing things up as usual."</b></p><p>"SHUT UP!" Naruto screamed and Kyuubi was annoyed to see Naruto's eyes flash red. Naruto calmed down and continued speaking with a glare on his face.</p><p>"So here's what we're going to do. You are going to stay out of the public's eye. No one can know you're here and no one can know who you are. Meanwhile I'm going to be doing some research and see how to put you back inside of me. There will be no whining, no complaining, no mischief or dangerous intentions at ALL coming from you. And if so much as TRIP someone and I find out I'll kill myself so fast you won't even realize it happened! Got it?"</p><p>Kyuubi didn't show Naruto he understood. He merely crossed his arms and looked at Naruto blankly, his eyes communicating all of what he thought about Naruto and his so-called demands.</p><p>Kyuubi did 'get it'. He gets it now that his vessel was much more tyrannical than he had once believed. He thought this kind of treatment was reserved only for the snake Orochimaru, but it appears he underestimated the sheer loathing Naruto held for him.</p><p>An understandable mistake on his part. After all the real Naruto was always angry at everyone but him. He liked that Naruto so much better. It was a real shame this Naruto was using that delicious anger against him.</p><p>Naruto apparently got tired of waiting and finally spoke again.</p><p>"Okay now we're going to head back into Konoha. Here," he took off his jacket and pants, leaving him in nothing but his boxers, shoes, forehead protector, and shirt, and gave them to Kyuubi. Though he made sure to keep his weapons pouch with him. "Wear these, follow me closely, and don't say anything. I'll take you to my apartment if it's still around first and I'll figure out what to do next once we get there."</p><p>Kyuubi silently took the clothes and took his sweet time putting them on. It was a good thing he hadn't gotten used to using this body yet. Moving at a slow speed would be sure to piss his vessel off. And he knew, or at least he HOPED he knew, Naruto wouldn't kill himself over Kyuubi moving too slowly. That would be done.</p><p>Once he was done Naruto nodded and started walking out of the cave.</p><p>"Now let's go. And don't lag too far behind."</p><p>Bossy, bossy, bossy. Humans were all the same, Kyuubi thought as he followed Naruto.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>So Naruto is a jerk here I know but there's a point to that. I'll explain.</p><p>I think a good story is a story that has development. Character development, relationship development, plot development, etc. One thing about the Naruto manga that kind of irked me a little was that I didn't really understand how Naruto went from:<b>(SPOILERS AHOY! scroll down to the 'end spoilers' tag if you want to skip them)</b></p><p>"Kyuubi's power is dangerous and I can't use it or I'll hurt people."</p><p>to:</p><p>"I'm sorry Kyuubi."</p><p>and then to:</p><p>"I get you're lonely Kyuubi but we'll talk later lol."</p><p>I mean he jumped from point A to point C and skipped most of point B! Now I know there was this quick address of that when he admits to the four tails that he was jealous of Bee and Gyuuki's relationship and he wanted his relationship with Kurama to be that way, but I don't get it because we never see Naruto show this. He doesn't go to visit Kyuubi or anything! And when he finally does he brushes Kyuubi off! And then in order to get Kyuubi's respect it took saving another tailed beast...</p><p>Don't get me wrong! I LOVE how Naruto and Kyuubi are friends now and I thought the chapters leading up to their big team up were AWESOME(I was squealing for every page!)</p><p>But I dunno it just made me a little sad to see Kyuubi thinking back to all of the times Naruto was 'nice' to him and he could only think of two things(one of which, Naruto wasn't even speaking to him and it was really kind of out of nowhere. Seriously he had been complaining all his the throughout the manga about being a demon vessel and then suddenly it isn't all bad? When did this change happen?)that happened within the same week or day or something.</p><p>So basically what I'm saying is I was okay with Kyuubi's development from hating Naruto to liking him(even though it similarly came pretty quick at least we got foreshadowing of it in previous chapters). But I was NOT satisfied with how Naruto came around. I can't pinpoint the exact time he changed his mind about Kyuubi and that sucks :/. And I wish he could've <i>shown</i> this 'jealousy' and that he wanted his relationship with Kyuubi personally to change.</p><p>Cuz as much as I hate to say it(as much as I reeeeeeeally hate to say it since Naruto is(i meant is. He still is my favorite character hah:P)my favorite character), I thought Naruto was kind of a jerk in 538 ._.</p><p><b>(End SPOILERS)</b></p><p>So if you skipped all that, the main reason I made Naruto that way is because I want to develop his relationship with Kyuubi in a <i>believable</i> way. I want to show how he goes from believing what Jiraiya, Kakashi, Yamato, Iruka, and everyone else has said about him, to eventually caring for him as an individual. I want to show when does his mind change, how does his mind change, why does his mind change, etc. And I will try to show the stages(simple respect, acquaintances, friendship, love, you get it).</p><p>And it will be vice versa for Kyuubi. Clearly he is not going to fawn over Naruto just because he knows him better. Instead his feelings and stuff will have to grow and change with Naruto's. And again I want to make it believable.</p><p>Basically their relationship will grow like October 10th, only they have legitimate reasons to hate each other and unlike in that story Naruto has no obligation to be nice to Kyuubi haha.</p><p><b>BUT</b> do note this will <b>NOT</b> be just a 'romance' story. Since this takes place in the ninjaverse, Naruto AND Kyuubi will have to grow and develop in canon/other ways not relating to each other(for example Kyuubi will have to learn that all humans are different from one another, how to treat his fellow tailed beasts, etc.). By this point you already know things have changed what with Nagato surviving and this WILL impact the rest of the story making it an alternate universe to canon. But canon stuff will still stay.</p><p>There will still be the Uchiha problem(Sasuke, Madara, Tobi, etc.), the Kabuto problem, the peace problem, etc.. I will try to resolve all of those as well.</p><p>So yeah this will be a big one. It kind of has to be lol. So I will very much appreciate it if people could be patient with this story? It will require a lot of planning and keeping up with the manga. Thank you!</p><p>My profile shows which stories I will update next and when this one will be updated again.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this! And please let me know what you think!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p>And finally here it is! Chapter 4!</p><p>So sorry for the loooooooooooooooooong wait! Working on my other stories plus college :/. And a mini writer's block once I finally got to working on this. Hopefully my next update for this story won't take nearly as long.</p><p><i>Anon Review Reply-</i></p><p><i>Nami152- </i>Thank you so much :)! Yeah Kyuubi and Naruto reaaaally aren't fond of each other and it's going to take actions on both ends for them to get to 'oh being with you isn't so bad after all'. They will be pretty hostile towards each other at first as you will see lol :P. I'm glad you like the style! Hope I can keep it up haha. This chapter is in Naruto's POV :)!</p><p><i>XGravityX- </i>KyuuNaru Queen? Oh wow that made me blush! THANK YOU :D!</p><p><i>Blaufeder-</i> Thank you very much :)! or Danke!</p><p>NOTE: The rest of this story will all be in Naruto's and Kyuubi's POV. They will alternate chapters. This chapter is in Naruto's POV. The next will be Kyuubi's. The one after will be Naruto's, etc.</p><p>Please enjoy and I apologize again for the super long wait!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"Daddy's little fuck up."</p><p>He wouldn't stop.</p><p>"Daddy's little mistake."</p><p>He just kept <i>taunting</i> him.</p><p>"His last earthly request was to you, his only son, and you messed it up."</p><p>Naruto put his hands over his ears. He wished Kyuubi would just shut up! He KNOWS he messed up. He remembers.</p><p>"<i>He's trying to get out! Naruto! I need you to use all of your will power to hold him back while I redo the seal! I'm counting on you. We can't let him escape!"</i></p><p>And Naruto remembered what he said.</p><p>"<i>Okay dad! Just leave it to me!"</i></p><p>And now he knows he failed. He failed spectacularly. He knows it because since they've left the cave, Kyuubi has done nothing but remind him of it. At least he stopped that stupid voice trick. There was such a thing as small miracles. Though Naruto wasn't entirely sure if that fitted the strictest definition of a miracle. He wasn't sure what was worse. Hearing a toned-down Kyuubi taunt him constantly or hearing his own voice just a bit deeper taunt him. Naruto had to always try hard just to avoid self-decrepitating thoughts every time he failed, but with Kyuubi's voice now sounding so much like his own it was getting a bit tough to handle.</p><p>"His true last request, failed just like his previous one."</p><p>Naruto still refused to respond to the fox demon and even with his hands over his ears he tried to hold his head up high. He didn't even look back to see the horrid grin he <i>knew</i> was on the demon's face.</p><p>"But hey look on the bright side! You should be happy to know that you are just like the rest of your village. That's what you always wanted right? To fit in? To have something in common with the rest of your so-called peers? Well Konoha fails horribly when it comes to listening to their fourth Hokage and you're no different!"</p><p>Naruto closed his eyes and took deep breaths to try and calm down. The bastard was trying extra hard now to get under his skin. He couldn't give the fox the satisfaction of knowing his words were hitting him hard.</p><p>"Hmm let's remember. Before the last request was 'treat my son as a hero'. Of course he didn't use the word 'son' and I don't think he's regretting that now. You're not necessarily his pride and joy anymore now are you?"</p><p>Naruto gritted his teeth and brought his fists to his side. But he refused to verbally respond to Kyuubi's taunts. That's want he wanted and that's was Naruto refused to give. He just needed to breathe deeply and tune him out.</p><p>"You remember how badly the village failed their request right? Of course you do! You'll <b>never</b> be able to forget now will you?"</p><p>Naruto desperately tried to focus on something else as he was this close to snapping. The landscape of Konoha wasn't looking to good in his opinion. He wondered if they were even in the village.</p><p>"So Naruto?" the fox called out softly. In spite of himself Naruto found himself glancing back. He regretted it immediately as the malicious-looking grin on Kyuubi's face and the wicked look in his blood red eyes made his insides curl.</p><p>"You remember his true last request don't you? He made it such a short time ago that I am <i>certain</i> you remember how badly you screwed that up. Worse than the villagers I would say," and he continued speaking in that same, <i>maddening</i> soft tone of voice.</p><p>"Stop…<i>talking</i>," Naruto growled out through gritted teeth.</p><p>"Or what?" His companion asked with a chuckle. A chuckle that made Naruto want to turn around and strangle him.</p><p>"You'll kill yourself? Come on. I know you're not stupid enough to threaten suicide over the <i>attention</i> I'm giving you, are you? I know it's quite a gamble to bet on your intelligence, but despite these past couple of decades I'll have you know that I'm usually a lucky fox."</p><p>Attention? He called what he was doing to Naruto 'attention'?</p><p>"But I still can't believe you threatened your life with suicide earlier. I thought you had so much to live for."</p><p>"Of course you can't believe it. You were about to take away my reasons for living."</p><p>"That is not healthy you know. Living for yourself should be number one. It's in all survivable creatures' heads. It's in mine and I survived thousands and thousands of years. Even now, you humans made quite a dent in my way of living but <i>I </i>keep going on."</p><p>"You don't understand," Naruto gritted out. How dare Kyuubi look down on him for caring about others? At least he had friends, people who would miss him if he was gone. Sure he doesn't have a lot but it's more than Kyuubi. No one would miss the fox's sorry ass if he died. The thought made Naruto feel a tiny bit better.</p><p>"No I don't get it. And I really don't want to."</p><p>Naruto shook his head and hoped this meant now the son of a bitch would finally shut up. He didn't want to hear the demon any more than he wanted to see his village in this kind of state. Blue eyes looked around sadly.</p><p>So many buildings were gone. The beautiful things like the fountains and the many pots of colorful flowers were no more. The many giant, green trees that immediately surrounded the village were broken or completely destroyed, pushing Konoha's forest farther back than it used to be.</p><p>The village looked so empty, so desolate. It was like a large wasteland. Naruto couldn't believe this used to be his home. A bright place where the sky was always blue and the sun shined brightly except when it rained. Now the sky was a dreary grey, but there was no rain. How could one person do this to the village?</p><p>He remembered the hustle and bustle of everyday life in Konoha. But now it didn't look like anyone other than he and his unfortunate companion were around. Sort of like the wasteland of Konoha was a ghost town-like wasteland. He almost wanted to see someone else hustling and bustling other than himself. But he was...okay for now. The village looked so bad, that seeing anyone look around with the same despair that had to be on his face would surely make his heart twist. And seeing a villager's or a comrade's dead body, would just make his stomach sick.</p><p>Imagining it now was already making him kind of sick, he thought squeezing his eyes shut.</p><p>"Isn't this site beautiful Naruto?"</p><p>Naruto's eyes shot open and he stiffened for the quickest second before walking again. Kyuubi was starting again.</p><p>"I've been waiting to see this kind of destruction done to this place again. It may not be my attack, but it is wonderful to see. The only things that are missing, other than more destruction of course, are the bodies of civilians and ninja alike; crushed and bleeding out like little ants."</p><p>Naruto's breathing got heavier as he pictured it. He experienced shot of anger directed at Kyuubi for putting the picture in his mind.</p><p>"The fourth Hokage bled out fast and so did that ugly woman that was with him. I only wish you suffered the same before I was sealed into you."</p><p>Naruto wasn't going hold himself back this time. He didn't care if he was giving the demon the reaction he was looking for. If Kyuubi said <i>one more thing</i>...</p><p>"I need a haircut."</p><p>The fact that it was an innocent statement didn't matter. It was the person who spoke it. Naruto felt something inside of him snap at the sound of his voice again.</p><p>"GO KILL YOURSELF!"</p><p>"Hm?" Kyuubi raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"I mean go screw yourself! You're not funny! You're not cool! You're a <b>menace</b><i><b>! </b></i>Someone NOBODY wants around! And I TOLD you to be quiet!" Naruto shouted rearing back a fist, ready to knock the monster's teeth out.</p><p>"And what will you do if I don't shut up hm? Tell on me?"</p><p>Kyuubi pointed behind Naruto. Naruto turned around and was horrified to see a fellow Konoha ninja limping away from them. Naruto gasped and panic seized his body. Did the ninja see him and Kyuubi? Did he know who he was trying to punch? What if he was limping off to find someone to speak to about Naruto's failure?</p><p>He would never hurt a fellow Konoha ninja, and the sentiment has only gotten stronger after all that has just happened. But some damage control needed to be done.</p><p>"Get behind those rocks now," he ordered Kyuubi, pointing a pile of rocks beside them. It frustrated him to no end to see the red-head, idly kick at the rocks instead of doing what he was told.</p><p>"I don't think these are rocks Naruto," he pointed out. "They look more like the pieces of a collapsed building."</p><p>"I don't care! Just hide yourself behind them, shut up, and don't move AT ALL until I come and get you."</p><p>And without sticking around to make sure Kyuubi did what he was told, Naruto turned around and sped after the injured ninja.</p><p>"Hey! Hey wait!" He called out. The ninja stopped and turned around. Naruto didn't recognize him, but he could see that the boy was incredibly young; couldn't have been older than 13-years-old. He looked roughed up. Burns, scratches, and bruises littered his body, but hopefully it wasn't too serious.</p><p>"Who are you?" Naruto immediately asked. "What are you doing here? What did you see?"</p><p>But instead of answering Naruto's questions, the boy only gaped at him. He could see the boy recognized him.</p><p>"You're that guy," he said his expression one of awe.</p><p>"Um what?" Not used to people looking at him that way Naruto fidgeted nervously.</p><p>"You-you showed up!"</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"That guy that showed up, on the giant toad."</p><p>"Giant toad? You mean Gamabunta and his friends?"</p><p>To Naruto's surprise the boy smiled and looked excited.</p><p>"I saw you! I mean you're missing your clothes but I know it was you! I was hiding right over there the entire time! You showed up with giant frogs and fought that guy that was trying to kill us! I hate myself for passing out when that red light showed up, but I just woke up and I was so scared that you lost. I was scared that everyone but me died! But here you are! That means you defeated him right? We're all safe right?"</p><p>He didn't defeat Pain. Kyuubi did. But he couldn't tell anyone that. He couldn't let them know how he lost control of his inner monster.</p><p>But how could he take credit for something he didn't do?</p><p>Even if it was <i>Kyuubi</i> Naruto had never been the type to take credit for others work. He had always believed that he should only show off what <i>he</i> can do. That was how he wanted to earn respect. He didn't want Kyuubi to have anything to do with his climb to the top anymore.</p><p>Naruto's lack of reply makes the question repeat.</p><p>"You did kill Pain…right?"</p><p>"Pain was killed." He finally said. Because it was true...</p><p>"You killed him?" A bright smile. Naruto flinches.</p><p>"He was killed," he repeated. "And I…helped create the means through which he was defeated but I don't know if I can say…"</p><p>"Wow I can't believe it! You killed Pain! You killed the guy attacking us! Wow! You saved us! You're a hero!" The boy exclaimed.</p><p>Naruto paused at that.</p><p>A hero?</p><p>Him?</p><p>He was so distracted by that sentiment he didn't even notice the boy wrap his arms around his waist. He was broken out of his thoughts by the sound of rocks falling over. The ninja in front of him winced and pulled away.</p><p>"Our village is almost totally destroyed." Yes but that sound came from behind them where Kyuubi was. He glared in that direction before commanding the boy,</p><p>"You go and find some people and tell them Pain is gone now."</p><p>"What will you do hero?" Naruto winced. The boy was looking up at him with such admiration in his brown eyes. His stomach was starting to feel a little sick again. But he hid his discomfort and smiled a fake smile at the kid.</p><p>"You don't have to call me that. Just call me Naruto. But I'll go search over there," he pointed behind him, "for anyone else."</p><p>The boy grinned. "Okay Naruto! I'll be really fast!" And with that he hobbled away. Naruto thought about helping the young ninja walk but he already had something to focus on. As much as he didn't want to focus on it and wished the problem would just disappear. But he couldn't bear to make this problem any worse. He felt guilty enough for being called a hero when he wasn't anyway, solving the issue with Kyuubi would be his saving grace. Otherwise he would never be able to show his face to Konoha again.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"Didn't I tell you to keep still?" Naruto glared. Kyuubi shrugged.</p><p>"I had an itch I needed to scratch."</p><p>"And it required you to knock down a couple of rocks," Naruto said sarcastically.</p><p>"I don't think me giving away my position is the big issue here," Kyuubi grinned and Naruto could only imagine what was coming. He was thinking another taunt about his father again or maybe a taunt about how that kid secretly hated him. But what he got was worse.</p><p>"Aren't you the noble one? Letting that naive idiot think <i>you're</i> the hero."</p><p>Naruto stiffened and instinctively defended himself. "I did it for our sakes! I told you I can't let anyone know you're here! It's to protect us!"</p><p>"You mean you did it for <i>your</i> sake. You could care less about me. It's all to save your precious reputation."</p><p>"You're wrong. I <b>couldn't</b> care less about you," Naruto sneered. He ignored Kyuubi's other accusation. So what if he did care about what the others thought of him? Their acknowledgment was something he had been working his whole life towards. It was a long progress and to lose it all now and go back to the hell that was his childhood was something he couldn't deal with. He was only human. But he felt guilty about it!</p><p>"You know, you're mind set isn't at all healthy for you."</p><p>"Oh shut up! You're nothing but a demon, a monster. You wouldn't understand!"</p><p>"And you are a perfect constant reminder as to why I never want to understand," Kyuubi glared. It was the first time since they had left the cave that Naruto saw Kyuubi look angry. But he wasn't intimidated. Or at least, he didn't show he was. He quickly turned his back to Kyuubi.</p><p>"We need to get to my apartment."</p><p>"If it's still standing. Be prepared to become homeless Naruto. And this time you don't have a kindly, old man looking out for you."</p><p>That's right, he didn't. Instead he had a rotten, old demon who hated him and who he hated back.</p><p>"Now you are on my ignore list until we get there. Don't say a word until we get there."</p><p>"Well geeze Naruto if you didn't want to talk to me why didn't you just say so?"</p><p>Naruto scowled, but oddly enough when they started walking again Kyuubi was silent. It was a good thing and Naruto was happy not to hear the demon's mocking voice. But it had the added drawback of allowing him to really focus on the surrounding area.</p><p>He didn't like seeing how his once beautiful, proud, standing village was almost no more. Piles of once houses and stores, no shrubbery as far as he could see, an eerie silence as if everyone had died like that boy thought. The only sounds he heard were his own footsteps and Kyuubi's. But he wasn't about to admit to himself that Kyuubi being here made him feel less alone. As if he preferred Kyuubi's company to loneliness.</p><p>The sight of his village was starting to be too much so he looked at the ground and attempted to think about other, less-depressing things, like how Pain can't do any more damage to the village, until he and Kyuubi reached what remained of his apartment.</p><p>It was a miracle it was still standing. It didn't look very good, he could see his bathroom and part of his training room from the outside, but it was still standing. They quickly snuck inside, Naruto getting angry more than once as Kyuubi was so damn <i>clumsy</i> at doing it. It felt like he was messing up on purpose. Once inside, Naruto hurriedly shut the blinds on his window and did a scan around to make sure there was no way anyone could see he and Kyuubi inside his room.</p><p>After he determined that they were completely safe from the public's eye in his apartment, Naruto let out a huge sigh of relief. But his relief was gone when he saw Kyuubi plop down onto his bed and curl up.</p><p>"What are you doing?" He demanded walking up to the bed.</p><p>Kyuubi yawned in response.</p><p>"Get up! We have things to do!"</p><p>"Don't you mean <i>you</i> have things to do? <i>You</i> have to research the seal and <i>I</i> can't be in public remember? Just let me sleep."</p><p>Naruto opened his mouth to say something but ended up saying nothing because he realized Kyuubi was right. He had nothing in here that can help him with seals which meant he needed to go out again. And although the thought of having this monster sleep in his room-in his bed- wasn't exactly pleasant, he wasn't too angry to pick up on something. Kyuubi sounded tired. Incredibly tired. Exhausted might be the most accurate word to use.</p><p>Naruto didn't understand how he could be exhausted from a little walking but then he remembered that Kyuubi killed Pain. And he was missing eight of his tails. And just how much energy did he spend killing the Akatsuki leader? If he only had one tail of his power then...It was then that Naruto heard the fox's soft snoring.</p><p>Naruto stood by and looked at the sleeping Kyuubi for only a few more seconds before turning around and walking away.</p><p>He wasn't letting Kyuubi sleep to be nice. He's doing it because it's the least he could do to make up for inadvertently taking the credit for his kill. And because if Kyuubi did deserve anything, it was a little rest. But make no mistake, Naruto reassured himself, he still wasn't happy with the demon. He still didn't even like him. He hated him for all of the words he said and for trying to get under his skin.</p><p>Naruto would allow him a little rest and that's <i>it</i>.</p><p>Meanwhile, he needed to go do that research. But...the village was in a horrible shape right now. There were probably plenty of innocent people who needed help. His friends might also need his help. And what were the chances that library was still around?</p><p>He should go do that research. But as he quietly slipped out of his apartment, Naruto thought that maybe his primary duty as a ninja should be to go and help anyone who needs help. With his shadow clone jutsu it shouldn't take that long for him to do all he can. Maybe he'll finish and be able to get some research in before Kyuubi wakes up.</p><p>And he needs to do this anyway. If he couldn't be the hero who defeated Pain, he could at least be the hard-working ninja who helped clean up the aftermath.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>And done!</p><p>"You don't understand!" - Naruto sounding his age. LOL teenagers :P.</p><p>But yeah as you see Naruto and Kyuubi are really sticking it to each other. Not holding back at all. But time soothes anger so maybe when Kyuubi wakes up they'll be less hostile :D(lol).</p><p>I'm going to try my ABSOLUTE best to update this sooner than four months. The mini-writer's block came because I didn't know how to connect a passage of time with Naruto finding out all that happened in the village. And of course with the destruction how was he going to research the seal...and other problems...etc. I FINALLY got through it by realizing Kyuubi could just fall asleep lol. I t made everything easier.</p><p>Check my profile to see the status of my other stories(next to be updated is October 10th). Also I have a poll up. Please check it out if you have the time :)!</p><p>Please tell me what you think!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><p>Finally here is chapter 5!</p><p>This is a little short and for that I am sorry. However I feel it covers everything I needed to cover in this chapter.</p><p><i>Anon Review Reply:</i></p><p><i>Guest- Ah thanks :D! Well I can't exactly tell you if that's why you like this story better but I wouldn't be surprised XD. Some people just do not like AU and I understand and respect that. But I'm glad you at least like what I write :D. Well that's good because you will see A LOT of 'teasing' going on between the two for a while ;P.</i></p><p><i>I can't say HOW successful he will be, but I can say the thought won't stop him from trying lol.</i></p><p><i>I know :). Long hair represents regality, elegance, and power haha. In-story, his reason for wanting a hair-cut is that it reminds him of Kushina and Mito and he hates that. Personally though I prefer him with short hair. It's a really small thing though.</i></p><p><i>Thank you!</i></p><p>And that's it!</p><p>Please enjoy!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>When Kyuubi woke up it was pitch black outside and he was alone.</p><p>He was surprised when he felt the soft mattress under him instead of the hard floor. He could've sworn Naruto would be petty enough to push him to the floor in his sleep and not let the demon enjoy the comforts of soft bedding. But dwelling on Naruto's incredibly strange act of what could be kindness, was not as joyful as dwelling on the fact that Kyuubi woke up and was <i>alone</i>.</p><p>He was actually alone. No Naruto, no jinchuuriki, just him. Kyuubi hasn't been by himself since before Mito which was ages ago.</p><p>And he had stretching room. A rare, happy smile appeared on Kyuubi's face as he rolled onto his back and stretched across Naruto's bed. He already knew he would only be able to grant himself pure happiness in moments like these. Complete solitude after everything he had gone through was such a joy and he would take advantage of it. He had to because as soon as Naruto comes back it would be back to being miserable again.</p><p>Kyuubi sighed, happy mood gone with that thought. It was easy to put a front up of being in control and to keep on snickering. It was so easy to hide how completely miserable he truly felt because Naruto was so blind to everything about him. He hardly noticed anything. This was a good thing admittedly. Kyuubi might actually take a leaf from Naruto's book and threaten suicide if he <b>ever</b> received pity from the blond. There would be no way he could fall any further than that.</p><p>Though it was hard to believe he wasn't at his lowest point already. His first chance at freedom in years and he can't even enjoy it. He can't be happy knowing Naruto is dead set on taking it away as soon as possible. And what's worse, he's stuck in a form he can hardly use. His clumsy attempts at sneaking into this building were so building were complete embarrassments for one so prideful such as him. The only plus was annoying the hell out of his vessel, whose baby-like sneers at his ability were a joy to see. But still he hated it. He had never had to sneak anywhere in his life before so he had no experience doing it, but he hated it.</p><p>And to avoid ever doing it again, Kyuubi needed to get out of this situation. He was determined to escape, but just like Naruto and his seal business, Kyuubi had obstacles too. There were so many things he didn't know what to do about yet.</p><p>His power for instance, what should he do there? He wasn't exactly lying to Naruto about building up his power, but he wasn't exactly telling the truth either. He was born with his power. He was born a nine-tailed fox. Those tails had been with his all his life and like many things one is used to, he can't exactly tell if he was always as strong as he was or if, like he told Naruto, it was something he trained for. Either way, in the heat of anger he was hoping the 'I-worked-for-my-power' spiel would incite at least a little empathy but apparently things were just too horrible between Naruto and him. All it did was confirm that Kyuubi needed to get his power back somehow because he honestly doesn't know if he'll ever get it back if he doesn't.</p><p>And of course, he needed to tear the connection between their lives so that if Naruto ever dies he would stay alive. It shouldn't be impossible to figure out. The seal was already designed so that if Kyuubi ever left Naruto would die. Problem is he left in an unorthodox way which is probably why they are both still alive. But if he were to unseal his power the <i>normal</i> way, would the effect on Naruto's life be the same?</p><p>But, Kyuubi frowned, if Naruto still died from that, would he die too? It was back to square one, Kyuubi thought gritting his teeth. There had to be a way to combat this, there had to. This one-way life thing had to be the second most annoying part of this whole thing. Knowing his life was tied to an impulsive and reckless kid did not help him sleep at night, even when he was still in the seal.</p><p>It was then that the door to the apartment opened and Naruto slowly shuffled in. Kyuubi sat up and turned to face him. He looked worse than when Kyuubi had seen him last. Dirt, grime, and blood caked his skin and clothes and his dirty, golden blond hair lay limp over his forehead as his carefully guarded forehead-protector was strangely missing.</p><p>He was frowning and there was a haunted look in his blue eyes. Kyuubi could pick up traces of emotions coming from the 16-year-old. Downtrodden, heart wrenching, depressing emotions.</p><p>But he didn't care.</p><p>"Oh good you're home. Make me dinner I'm hungry."</p><p>"Oh look he demands food from me," Naruto muttered rolling his eyes. Kyuubi was surprised at how quickly his vessel responded, but he didn't stop.</p><p>"This body demands nutrients."</p><p>"Go chew on wood," Naruto said flipping the bird. "I'll be damned if I ever cook for a monster."</p><p>"Or you'll be someone with a heart who does not let silly prejudices get in the way of your hospitality."</p><p>Naruto simply stared at him and crossed his arms. Kyuubi didn't want to admit it but the stare did unnerve him a little. Unlike before, Kyuubi wasn't the cause of it.</p><p>"Starve to death."</p><p>Kyuubi paused.</p><p>And he got a wicked theory. A risky, wicked theory. But one he really wanted to test. It was a crazy, crazy risk.</p><p>But to able to put Naruto in his shoes would be so, so worth it. He needed to know how the brat would react to knowing that for once, his life literally was in Kyuubi's hands. And if nothing else, perhaps a threat to his own life would finally shake him up. Killing Pain and threatening his friends either did nothing or worked against him. Maybe he could spin this to work in his favor.</p><p>"Alright. ...But...what will that mean for you?"</p><p>"It'll mean nothing but joy and happiness to finally have you out of my hair."</p><p>"No Naruto. I mean, before it was always if you died, I died. But now that the seal is so plainly messed up, perhaps the shoe is on the other foot now."</p><p>At that Kyuubi was pleased to see Naruto slowly drop his arms to side and that unnerving stare, an expression so foreign on his face, was replaced with a wary, worried, and confused look.</p><p>"...What are you saying?"</p><p>"I think even you know what I'm saying Naruto," Kyuubi stood up and walked over to Naruto's kitchen area. He could feel the boy tense up when he grabbed a large butcher knife. Facing Naruto, he slowly ran his finger along the edge. He was going to enjoy this.</p><p>"I'm saying that you can hold my tails hostage, but I wonder if I can hold your life hostage. If I die," Kyuubi looks straight into his eyes. "You die."</p><p>"What about your tails?!" Naruto immediately responded. The slight tremble in his voice and the underlying anxiety and fear was exactly what Kyuubi was looking for.</p><p>Kyuubi let out a bark of laughter. "I ALWAYS come back Naruto! Haven't they told you that? Kill me and you've only deterred a 'natural disaster' for a few years. Despite your feelings for me I'm too <i>damn</i> important to be killed off for good. And when I do come back I can just build up my power again, just like you said. However, YOU can't come back. You will never be Hokage, you will leave many unfulfilled promises behind, and those people you care about so much will grieve your death but will very quickly move on. How's that? So many miserable consequences for you because YOU let me starve."</p><p>The look on Naruto's face made Kyuubi's insides tingle with glee. He looked like a deer staring his predator in the eyes.</p><p>"I-I...That's...A stretch-"</p><p>"Not a stretch Naruto," Kyuubi clarified, still running his finger along the knife. "I'm leaving your friends alone. Just <i>you</i> will be taken down with me. Poetic justice I like to think of it as. All of these years we've known each other and you've never given a rat's ass about me. Now your neglect and lack of care will kill you in the end. Because you want me to try to survive in un-survivable conditions. I don't know what I'm doing here Naruto. I need guidance," the monster pouted in a mocking way before smirking a psychotic smirk.</p><p>He held the knife out towards Naruto. "So if you want, we can test that theory out. I'm giving you the perfect chance to end it all right now. You can take this knife and do whatever you want with it. I won't stop you."</p><p>He was lying, just a little, with that last sentence.</p><p>Naruto stood still for what felt like the longest time. He didn't move a muscle and Kyuubi wondered if the boy somehow went into shock. But then one arm slowly and shakily rose and Naruto's fingers wrapped around the edge of the knife. Kyuubi let him have the kitchen utensil without resistance and inwardly prepared himself for what Naruto would do.</p><p>His vessel stood still for several long seconds, his head bowed so that his bangs blocked his eyes from view. The tailed beast could not pick up any kind of emotion coming from the boy either. Naruto then turned to the side and slowly shuffled to the kitchen area where he dropped the knife on the counter, reached up and opened one of his cupboards, and pulled out one of his many cup ramens.</p><p>Kyuubi smirked. He knew his vessel all too well.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"You aren't going to eat?" Kyuubi asked the boy sitting across from him. As expected, Naruto was silent. He was silent when he cooked the ramen, he was silent when made Kyuubi's bowl, and now he was silent as Kyuubi tried to eat. He wasn't even scolding him for constantly dropping the noodles on the floor or spilling the broth as he struggled with using chopsticks.</p><p>Instead Naruto stared at the table only occasionally glancing at him with a look of murder in his eyes.</p><p>Kyuubi wasn't intimated. Not at all. Naruto could drown in his bubbling hatred for him all he wanted. Not only could it not compare to the tailed beast's, he knew there was nothing Naruto could do to act on it. The only thing Naruto could hold against him is the seal, and Kyuubi already had a plan in mind for combatting that. Speaking of which, now would be a good time to put that plan in motion.</p><p>"Whatever research you need done for the seal, you should bring it here, to the apartment."</p><p>"And have you jeopardize my mission? Forget it!" Naruto finally spoke, his voice filled with more revulsion than he had ever heard coming from the blond. A remarkable emotion for Kyuubi to hear from Naruto as it reminded him of what truly lied in the boy's heart.</p><p>"It's a smart suggestion you little imbecile. Imagine what people are going to think if they see you researching the seal. 'What's he doing?' 'Is there something wrong?' 'I <i>knew</i> he'd mess up somehow.' 'We should inform someone and see him locked up for letting the Kyuubi out.' 'A failure and a monster, how could we ever see him as anything different?'"</p><p>"Okay! Okay! Shut up!" Naruto glowered fiercely at him. "Why do you keep doing this?!" He shouted. "Why do you keep taunting me? All my life you've done nothing but try and tear me down while only pretending to help me! I know you really you hate my guts and are trying to break me and escape, but what's the point of doing it now!? Why can't we just go on silently hating each other and ignoring each other for the rest of our lives?!"</p><p>"All your life? You slow-brained twit. Before now we've only had two face-to-face conversations and neither of them involved me making fun of you though I really, really should've," Kyuubi pointed out. What he did not point out, was his frustrated rant at an unconscious Naruto during the Valley of End.</p><p>"This is only years of pent-up rebuttal Naruto. Perhaps for all the times you spoke of me in such a negative manner," He responded glaring back. He wouldn't go as far as calling Naruto speaking about him behind his back as betrayal. Not even close. But he did not feel good feelings when the boy spoke to his teachers about him. But even back then he knew Naruto coming to talk to him was nothing but a pipe dream anyway.</p><p>"So you're still angry at everything and this is just your revenge? This is pathetic revenge if you ask me!"</p><p>"What would you know about revenge? You tackled Pain with a vengeance and couldn't even do that right. But don't worry; I'm sure your perverted mentor is smiling down on you at this second."</p><p>Naruto was right though. He was angry. He hated his vessel. And he was really, really glad that he now had the opportunity to finally express it.</p><p>"As for me? I seem to be doing a great job getting under your skin which is exactly what I wanted."</p><p>Naruto was trembling as he spoke these next words to Kyuubi, but his voice was steady and cold.</p><p>"This is all a sick joke to you. Fine. Let it be that. You should enjoy it and have your laugh now because I'm going to reseal you so quick you won't even see it coming."</p><p>"I didn't doubt that you would do everything you <i>can</i> to reseal me as fast as possible. That's why I've already figure out how I'm going to live for the next fifty years. I should have enough time to travel the countries sixty times over before you could even come close to the knowledge of seals your predecessors have." Kyuubi smiled an innocently taunting smile. "You'll be studying for a long time Naruto."</p><p>"I'll get you back inside of me within the year!"</p><p>Kyuubi scoffed and laughed mockingly. "Better not make a promise on that."</p><p>He turned around, leaving his leftovers and mess for Naruto to clean up, and walked towards Naruto's bed. Although the sleep he had was good, more shut-eye felt appropriate right about now.</p><p>He was shocked when he felt two hands roughly grab his shoulders and pull him back causing him to stumble and fall back onto the floor. He landed with a thud on the hard material and cursed aloud at the pain ringing through his head and back. Physical pain was not something he had experienced often, if ever before. He couldn't even remember the sting of having his tails impaled and his body stretched out in an almost shameful display while in Kushina's seal.</p><p>So this ache, this sharp ache that spread throughout his whole body with the point of impact being the worst. His joints and muscles froze and he wondered if that gasping noise wasn't just in his mind. It felt like the pain was crawling or slithering underneath his skin and that was the only thing he could feel and think. His vision was a blur of the dark colors of Naruto's ceiling, and the bright gold of his vessel's hair. The gasping noise was loud but not as loud as the ringing. What emotion he felt he couldn't tell. He felt so detached from his body and at the same time like his senses were on overdrive.</p><p>He felt like it lasted minutes, like time slowed down. But it was only three seconds. It took three seconds for his chakra to finally catch up and heal. The familiar warmth calmed him immensely and slowly but surely, the ringing stopped, the gasping stopped, the feeling stopped, and the pain stopped.</p><p>And when he came to and became aware of his surroundings again, he stared up into Naruto's cold blue eyes.</p><p>"You sleep on the floor."</p><p>And then Naruto stomped on his chest, causing another surge of unfamiliar pain to course through him, on his way to the bed. Kyuubi growled silently from where he laid. The slight shock he was experiencing, caused by the new pain and his initial reaction to it, combined with his slight chakra exhaustion from healing himself rendered him unable to move.</p><p>He heard Naruto get into his bed and under the covers and as he lay there on the ground he got the feeling the brat was going to put one hell of a fight up against him.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>And done!</p><p>Again sorry it is short.</p><p>Alright I think this wraps up all of the set up. The next chapter should have the plot finally moving forward.</p><p>Kyuubi experiences his first freak out here. Feel bad for him. It had a point. And I did try. For the record the 'shock' he experienced wasn't a physical shock as that is life-threatening. It the psychological one. It's his first(remembered) experience of physical pain and because a human body is most likely very different from his regular body...yeah. Point is it wasn't there for nothing and I tried to practice describing that kind of scene. I hope I didn't fail(or fail too hard at least).</p><p>Okay and I know Kyuubi and Naruto are being super harsh towards each other, but I kind of feel it is necessary.</p><p>We never actually got this kind of closure from them in canon. Like I said they went from point A to point C and skipped most of B. I would've loved to see them address many issues between them before they became friends so that's what I'm going to do here. They are going to get all of the hate for each other out before they start finally getting along.</p><p>So it's going to be slowfully, slowfully slow like Naruto in his apartment. Okay not THAT slow lol. But slower than October 10th and CC :P.</p><p>And you can always remind yourself what is going to happen in the end anyway XD.</p><p>Also let me thank everyone for being patient with this story. This story is literally the hardest for me to write haha. Aside from time constraints, for some reason it is so much easier to think of ideas for my other stories than this one. But I don't want to abandon this because every time I do finish a chapter, I feel a sense of accomplishment :)!</p><p>So yeah I actually have a good idea for the next chapter!</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this, please tell me what you think.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><p>And here is chapter 6!</p><p>I am soooooooooooo sorry for the long wait! For those who looked at October 10th yeah I sort of explained it there but if you didn't. I was distracted a lot. College had a lot to do with it of course and so did other goodies :P. Anyways I'm sorry I slipped so much on my updating schedule and I will try hard not to do that again.</p><p><b>Also</b> in case it needs to be said, on my profile I regularly put the the status of the next chapter. I even include a word count :D! And sometimes I update it more than once a day(usually if I write more than 200 words). So if you're ever curious at what's going on you may check my profile :)!</p><p>So this chapter is the longest one so far being over 5000 words. And the plot actually starts yay :D!.</p><p><b>NOTE</b>: Obligatory 'Sakura is useful' scene(s) in this chapter. I TRIED hard to make it seem more platonic if you don't like NaruSaku but if it comes off as romantic and you don't like it I'm sorry. Just know that it ends with KyuuNaru. Also mention of Hinata's feelings.</p><p><i>Anon Review Reply</i></p><p><i>Guest 1- Haha yeah Kyuubi's supposed to be mean But don't worry Naruto can always fight back and get revenge ;P. Thanks for your review :)!</i></p><p><i>Guest 2- My pleasure :)! Glad you liked that chapter! Yeah it kind of occured to me that if Kyuubi has never been in a human body he would have no idea how it works/functions and it would be so funny to write about his failures. In this chapter I had to skip over some since it is in Naruto's POV. But Kyuubi's still gonna fail a lot hehe.</i></p><p><i>YES! Thank you! Rushed is exactly the word I'd use to describe it. That won't happen here I assure you. Though I will admit that the interactions between Kakashi and Kyuubi were slightly humorous so it sucks I won't be able to do that :P. Oh well at least there is Iruka.</i></p><p><i>Hah! I think a lot of us liked the Naruto-Sasuke rivalry back in part 1. I certainly did. Gee I hope so! Development there is obviously going to move a bit faster than here but I'm treating both with care and trying really, really hard to keep it realistic(and at the same time not have it drag on. I now understand the value of fanservice :D!)</i></p><p><i>Yes he does. Keep reading to see if he keeps it ;)!</i></p><p><i>Lol your English is fine! Thanks for your review :D!</i></p><p>That's all.</p><p>Hope you enjoy the 6th chapter! Just went thru and edited some minor mistakes but this is still UNBETA'D</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>When Naruto wakes up he sees Kyuubi holding a knife in his hand.</p><p>He tenses for a few quick milliseconds, his instincts screaming orders at him. They quiet down the moment he sees that he isn't being attacked...Kyuubi is cutting himself. He watched wide-eyed as Kyuubi pricked his finger with a knife, a bored expression on the red-head's face as his red eyes followed the blood trail down to his hand. His pink tongue darted out and lapped up the blood and Naruto could see his finger had healed.</p><p>He couldn't contain his curiosity.</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>"Getting used to pain," Kyuubi answered. Naruto was surprised he did. He was dreading the back and forth games he KNEW Kyuubi was going to play. But this 'game' is kind of odd. Naruto nearly cringed when he saw Kyuubi drop the knife and start twisting his thumb and did actually do so when he heard the 'crack'. Apparently that too much for Kyuubi as the demon let out a gasp. Naruto felt a small chakra spike come from him as he held his broken thumb in his grip. When he pulled away it was healed but Kyuubi stilled rubbed it soothingly and muttered, "Too much" under his breath.</p><p>"Why are you doing that?" Naruto couldn't stop himself from asking. Kyuubi turned his gaze towards him and something about those red eyes and that blank expression unnerved him.</p><p>"Because last night you caught me off guard with your little sneak attack. That won't happen again."</p><p>Oh that. But instead of saying anything about that Naruto focused on the now.</p><p>"You got blood on my floor. And I see you left your mess out!" Naruto glared at the ramen cup still tipped over on the table and the cold noodles on his floor. The smell of old ramen now will probably linger for a few days. But secretly Naruto was grateful for the smell of ramen was much more tolerable than the smell of the dead.</p><p>Still suddenly everything felt dirty. His bed felt dirty. His apartment felt dirty. Kyuubi felt dirty. He felt dirty. Konoha felt dirty. He just wished that a giant waterfall of soap and bubbles would fall out of the sky and wash over Konoha and when it all stopped the village and everyone in it would be sparkling clean again.</p><p>But that went way beyond wishful thinking. Things won't change unless Naruto gets up and does something.</p><p>"Last night, you said we can ignore each other for the rest of our lives. I just wanted to let you know that this is possible as I will outlive you."</p><p>Naruto completely ignored Kyuubi's statement. He was a mess. He needed a bath. Kyuubi needed one too.</p><p>"You stink," he said.</p><p>"Well you don't exactly smell like roses either. And who do you think has the more sensitive sense of smell? I deserve your cooperation for putting up with that for this long and not complaining until you brought it up."</p><p>"You deserve a lot of things I think. But the only thing you are going to get right now is a bath."</p><p>"A bath? You're lucky I'm still wearing the clothes you gave me. I had every urge to rip these garments off along with my hair."</p><p>Speaking of hair, Naruto didn't want to comment on it but Kyuubi sure did a number to his. Naruto's face scrunched up in confusion as he looked at the butchered, uneven mess on top of Kyuubi's head. To his shoulders in the back, to his ears at the sides, and barely touching his red eyes in the front, and Naruto to wince at the top which was a look even he wouldn't be seen in public with.</p><p>Not that he cared at all about Kyuubi's looks. And judging by what he sees it appears Kyuubi didn't care either. But still even he had an urge to go through it with a comb or something and maybe even grab some scissors and snip a little, just so that Kyuubi would look at least a little presentable. Now he sort of understood why Sakura nagged him about his hair sometimes.</p><p>But then Naruto had thought. Where exactly did Kyuubi cut his hair?</p><p>"Where's the mess!?" He asked a bit angrily.</p><p>"Where there should've been a mirror obviously."</p><p>Naruto quickly untangled himself from his sheets and ran into his bathroom. He let out an angry groan as he saw all the red and black hair on the floor. Turning to Kyuubi he shouted, "Okay you are going to clean ALL OF THIS up! And you're going to clean the ramen and the blood too!" And he pointed at all of the messes Kyuubi made since he got here.</p><p>Kyuubi lazily glanced at him, "With what?"</p><p>"Your hands!" Naruto said semi-seriously. If he needed a mop or broom fine, Naruto will provide one. But first he was going to clean the hard way.</p><p>"Hah. No."</p><p>"Do it! Or I'll-"</p><p>"We are NOT going down that road again are we? Face it we're at a standstill there."</p><p>"I wasn't going to say that. I was going to say if you don't clean this mess up then I'll...I'll...I'll think of something."</p><p>"Wow. I'm terrified. I better do what you say before you actually think."</p><p>"JUST DO IT! I'm frustrated enough already and if you keep pushing me I'll...I'll fight you!"</p><p>"You'll fight me? Yeah right as if you can even beat me. I destroyed Pain or did you forget?" And to Naruto's surprise he could see Kyuubi's grin stretch a bit too wide. An action that was very familiar to him. So he smirked back.</p><p>"But like you said we're at a standstill so you can't kill me. And you don't know how to actually <i>fight </i>in that body do you? There's no element of luck or surprise or whatever it is you used to beat Pain because I know how clumsy you are. Yeah...okay I can incapacitate you IF I wanted to you know. So you better do as I say or else you won't be able to move at all again!"</p><p>Kyuubi's growl was low and menacing but Naruto wasn't bothered. Not when he saw Kyuubi get up and actually go do what he was told.</p><p>"And while you clean all this up I'm going to go find some supplies to fix this wall with. We're going to get clean tonight whether you want to or not."</p><p>"I don't care what you do Naruto. Just be sure to bring back some sealing stuff."</p><p>"Don't tell me what to do," Naruto mumbled under his breath. He's sure Kyuubi still heard his words but he left his apartment before the demon could reply and Naruto got roped into an arguing match that would leave one or both too frustrated to even function.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>It took Naruto several hours to make it back to his apartment. But that was because he kept on getting sidetracked and helping people. Sometimes he would even offer the wood he bought to others requiring him to keep going back to buy some more.</p><p>But true to his word that night, with the help of some clones, Naruto got his wall fixed. The plumbing was a little wonky but with the help of buckets Naruto managed to get himself a nice cleansing bath and force Kyuubi to take one as well. Any awkwardness was immediately nullified by the fighting, both verbally and physically, that took place during the bath.</p><p>Shoving, hair pulling, hitting, insults, making fun of body parts...by the time it was over, Naruto was so done with his demon that he locked him in the bathroom for the rest of the night; only opening the door once to throw some food in. Both men went to sleep angry.</p><p>In the morning, Naruto got up still mad but feeling the tiniest bit merciful due to what the day was. He first got dressed in his black garbs and didn't bother with breakfast because he wasn't hungry at all. He then opened the bathroom door and wasn't surprised to see Kyuubi awake, but he was surprised to see the bathroom still intact. Still he didn't say anything other than,</p><p>"I'm going out. Behave until I get back."</p><p>"Leaving again huh?" Kyuubi sneered. "Tell me just how much work have you gotten done on our situation?"</p><p>"What? Are you lonely here by yourself? Is that it?"</p><p>Kyuubi looked incredulous at that. "Hardly. These moments of solitude have been the best that I can remember since I've been sealed away. Surprise, surprise humans make terrible companions."</p><p>"You bring it on yourself!" Naruto growled.</p><p>"Of course," Kyuubi rolled his eyes. "Anyway the more correct word to use would be 'bored'. You're not doing anything to entertain or help me you horrible host! I had to learn how to work everything in here by myself! Including the porcelain thing!"</p><p>"There are some things that are a lot more important to handle right now! And I'm perfectly fine with you trying to entertain yourself so long as you don't break anything."</p><p>"Why not just bring back some books or scrolls and let <i>m</i>e do all the research?"</p><p>"Nice try. But there's no way I'll let you 'help' me. You would try to sabotage my research wouldn't you?"</p><p>"Is it really that surprising? You're trying to seal me away."</p><p>"<i>Lock</i> you away. You're a bad demon! You kill and hurt people for fun! It's like locking you up in prison for your crimes against humanity. Let me tell you if <i>I</i> did what you did I'd let myself get arrested with no fighting-"</p><p>"No you wouldn't!"</p><p>"-Because I know I deserve to locked up! You obviously lack the compassion to see that. And nothing will change the fact that you started-"</p><p>"I didn't start <b>anything</b>!"</p><p>"What?" Naruto asked looking shocked. Kyuubi just turned away.</p><p>"Forget it. Take your righteousness to whatever wedding you're going to."</p><p>"It's a funeral."</p><p>"I DON'T CARE!" Kyuubi practically roared. That combined with the rage Naruto could clearly feel coming from the demon, stopped him in his tracks. Although the blond was confident in his abilities to best the Kyuubi in a fight that was still a last resort option he wanted to avoid if he could. After all an all-out fight would draw immediate attention. Especially with recent events.</p><p>"...Fine. I'll probably be gone for a while and I won't be able to check up on you."</p><p>"..."</p><p>"...Don't break anything."</p><p>Naruto heads out, closes the door, takes two steps, and hears the sound of glass breaking from inside his apartment. With a loud sigh, he keeps walking.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>When he met up with Sakura, she was dressed in her funeral wear but looked completely composed. However she didn't act that way.</p><p>The first thing she did when she noticed him was almost roughly shove his now clean forehead protector into his hands and very quickly say, "Here'syourforeheadprotector! Allclean!"</p><p>And then she brought her arms to her sides and didn't look him in the eye. He gave her a few seconds to gather her thoughts again.</p><p>Kakashi was dead.</p><p>Shizune was dead.</p><p>Jiraiya was dead.</p><p>Pa was dead.</p><p>And Tsunade's in coma.</p><p>It's too much right now, Naruto knew. Too much for the both of them. The only hope they had now was that Tsunade would recover and even that task fell on his pink-haired teammate. Without Shizune there, she was the only one skilled enough to help Tsunade. They will both have to walk into this funeral ready to say good-bye and take on the (<i>too large</i>) responsibilities their mentors left them. Shikamaru with his words of wisdom or Iruka with his words of comfort would be all too good have right now. Because Naruto didn't know what he could say that could make Sakura and him feel better at the moment. Especially when Sakura was obviously trying hard to keep herself together.</p><p>So he didn't even try. Mumbling "thanks" for his protector before tying it around his neck, he then asked softly, "Ready to go?"</p><p>She took a few deep breaths before nodding quietly. They weren't walking long before Sakura grabbed Naruto's hand in a vice grip.</p><p>It hurt a bit, but Naruto squeezed back just as tightly.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The funeral is as bleak and depressing as previous funerals. Even more so probably. It wasn't raining, but Naruto was still getting wet because Sakura was crying into his shoulder.</p><p>"K-K-K-Kakashi-shi-sen-sen-seeeeei! S-Shi-Shi-Shizune!"</p><p>Naruto starts thinking about how two more of his teachers died, Pa and Kakashi. With Pa's death he wonders what will happen to Sage Mode. Who will teach it now that Pa was gone? There was Ma but could she do it? Would Naruto have to continue the line? Was he the last person who knew how to do Sage Mode? Should he teach it if that's the case? Who should he teach it to? His future children? Or students like Konohamaru? Or both? Should he set up a school offering lessons on how to get into Sage Mode? But what if he teaches the wrong person?</p><p>What if he ends up like Kakashi-sensei, and accidentally teaches a Sasuke?</p><p>Before his thoughts could go down <i>that</i> dark path, Sakura thankfully distracted him.</p><p>"I couldn't save them Naruto," She sobbed. "I-I found them too late. I tried-I tried so hard but I couldn't give them their lives back!"</p><p>"It's okay Sakura," Naruto reassured her as he wrapped his arm around her shoulder. If he were being honest he would admit that he wished she would try and comfort him too. It would be the first time since their missing teammate left that they could help each other without mentioning him.</p><p>But Naruto wanted to keep staying strong and helping Sakura helped him to do just that.</p><p>"Don't beat yourself up over it. They wouldn't want you to. Like you said you tried your <i>best</i>. And think about all the people you <i>did</i> save. So many people that would've died didn't because of you. Including some people we know,"</p><p>And with that Naruto glanced over to where the Hyuugas were standing. Hinata was standing right in the center, between her father and Neji. She looked just as sad and depressed as the rest of them but perhaps because her family was right there she held herself in a composed manner. Not a tear to be seen although he could pick up the slight tremble of her lips.</p><p>He stared longer than he meant to because then she looks at him and they meet eyes. Before, it was always Hinata who looked away, usually with rosy red cheeks. But this time it was Naruto who quickly looked away, sans blush.</p><p>He still had no idea what to say to her. She was a friend sure but she nearly died confessing her love to him. To <i>him</i>. All this time and he never even knew someone actually liked him like that. And now he didn't even know what to do and other than forget it because this really wasn't the time for such thoughts.</p><p>"Shizune was my mentor. My big sister," Sakura quietly sniffled. "And what-what will we do without Kakashi-sensei? We-we-things won't be the same without him."</p><p>Right...With Kakashi-sensei's death...even if they do bring Sasuke back now, Team 7 will never be complete again. The dam he had put up to block the tears was starting to crumble, but he only sniffled and subtly tried to hold his head back to keep them in. He will only cry when he's alone.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>After the funeral it was downtime at one of the few working restaurants. Naruto and Sakura had actually been invited to a larger dinner thanks to their outstanding efforts in the fight, but both declined to enjoy a quieter one. Together they sat at a table, slurping down drink after drink as neither of their stomachs could handle solids. They had paid for their drinks before they got them at Naruto's insistence. He had something he wanted to do and he wanted to do it fast after they'd eaten.</p><p>It was quiet for the first few minutes, aside from Sakura's occasional sniffles and hiccups, but Naruto knew he eventually had to bring this particular subject up. He wished the timing could've been better, but he knew what would happen if he went back home empty-handed once again.</p><p>"Hey Sakura? Do you know when the library will be rebuilt? Or when all the books will be available?" He asked. Sakura paused in the sipping of her drink and when she spoke to Naruto's great joy her voice wasn't heavy with tears anymore. Good. Her crying always left a heavy feeling in his gut.</p><p>"All of the books and scrolls from all the libraries have been recovered and are now-" She paused to sniffle. "-Are now being held and organized in a more secure place. Only certain personnel are allowed in at the moment. I can-I can get you something if you'd like."</p><p>"Why, you have access?"</p><p>"Yes Naruto. I have access. I need the medical textbooks. Par-Particularly ones on comas..."</p><p><i>Right</i>, Naruto thought wincing. Rather than drag on an awkward conversation, or maybe he just knew Sakura didn't want to talk about it right now, Naruto simply stated his request.</p><p>"I need any and all books and scrolls on sealing. Anything," he had to say anything to draw away suspicion. If he said he need things specifically based on his seal, they'll know immediately. Sakura looked at him, her shimmering green eyes wide in confusion.</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"I'm working on something. You'll find out soon enough," Naruto answered nervously. He hoped Sakura would just trust him on this.</p><p>"Something to prevent something like this from ever happening again?"</p><p>In sense...yeah he was. So he nodded. Sakura nodded back.</p><p>"Okay. The new library is open 24/7 so once we finish here we can go and grab what you need."</p><p>"Thanks Sakura," Naruto smiled gratefully. Sakura returned it with a smile of her own. But instead of 'you're welcome' or any other variation of that, she said something that stopped him in his tracks.</p><p>"You know I trust you completely right Naruto? I don't know what it was that happened before Pain died. I'm assuming it had something to do with your...you know...with the Kyuubi. But whatever it was you handled it. You controlled it and you took care of the greatest threat to Konoha since Kyuubi's attack. You did so well. I'm really proud of you, you know."</p><p>He had been getting compliments like that every time he shows his face. The most common is that he's a hero, just like dear old dad. He's been trying to see the good side. As long as they think it was him then his secret about Kyuubi was safe. But it was hard to handle. A grin, a quick 'thank you', and then disappearing as fast as he could did him good so far. But hearing this from <i>Sakura</i>...</p><p>"Don't say that to me."</p><p>"Why not? You deserve it. Yeah I'll miss Kakashi-sensei and Shizune and my heart goes out to all the people that died but," she took a deep breath. "You saved everyone else. I'm just one medic; I couldn't heal everyone in Konoha if I tried. But you Naruto, you tried and you <i>saved</i> everyone. And now look at everyone who respects you now! I was talking to Iruka-sensei earlier and we were remembering when you were just a little brat who ran around causing trouble. Now you're a hero and instead of glares everyone's sending you smiles now!"</p><p>This was getting to be too much. Way, way too much. Was she feeling guilty because he had to comfort her earlier? Forget what he had thought then. He didn't want to be comforted if it meant this, a cold feeling of guilt practically swallowing up his insides. Sakura placing her small hand on his own was just the icing on the bitterest cake ever.</p><p>"If anyone should be feeling accomplished now, it's you."</p><p>Accomplishment surprisingly didn't feel too good.</p><p>"We should go," he said standing up abruptly. "I need to get started right away."</p><p>He ignored Sakura's bewildered look. It didn't matter to him if she thought he was acting strange or whatever. Naruto just wanted to go get what he needed and get home immediately.</p><p>"I guess," Sakura started to say as she also stood up, "Embarrassment is to be expected. But don't worry Naruto it'll pass over soon and you'll feel proud of yourself. I'm sure of it!"</p><p>If that's what she thought...</p><p>"But let me give one last proper thank you," the pink-haired girl twiddled her fingers and blushed a little but Naruto paid it little mind. He wanted to rush now.</p><p>"No no it's fine-"</p><p>"Naruto let me thank you!" At the sight of Sakura's classic anger, Naruto quickly gave in. At least <i>that</i> was something he was used to.</p><p>So Sakura walked up to him. She wrapped one arm around his back and used the other to cup his cheek, leaned up and...</p><p>Hugged him.</p><p>Just hugged him and whispered another soft "thank you" in his ear.</p><p>And Naruto understood. A hug from Sakura was something he had been wanting since he was 12-years-old. And he could see random people stop and look, some curious most smiling.</p><p>Ask him before the Pain attack, and he'd tell you he'd <i>kill</i> for a moment like this.</p><p>But right now, the torrent of guilt inside him only grew bigger and if asked, he'd tell you he'd <i>kill</i> to avoid moments like this from now until he died.</p><p>Or maybe from now until Kyuubi was resealed and the next chance at a heroic redemption came his way.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>When he got back to his apartment, he was pleasantly surprised to see it was actually clean. Kyuubi was sitting on the floor, leaning on his bed waiting for him. Or maybe he was waiting for him, but is now resting his eyes.</p><p>Behind Naruto his clones were setting the books and scrolls on the table and then disappearing. But instead of getting right to work all that came to mind was what Kyuubi said before he left, about him not starting it. Whatever 'it' was. The attack on Konoha? The entire beef with Konoha? Naruto wasn't sure. And he wasn't sure if there was anything to be unsure about either. Kyuubi certainly looked serious when he stated that. But that didn't mean much considering who he was dealing with. Kyuubi could lie to him. He would do it easily Naruto knew. Maybe not for sympathy or pity points, but to take advantage of Naruto's hospitality and kinder nature.</p><p>He would do it. Naruto <i>knew</i> this.</p><p>And yet, something nagged at him. Kyuubi, he also knew, was a centuries old demon with tons of knowledge. He would definitely know more about the attack than he did. Pain, before he died, said much about truth and suffering. And Sakura was right that people glared at him before for his pranks, but what she didn't say is people glared at him before that. They glared when he <i>didn't do anything wrong</i> and it was because of the beast sitting in front him.</p><p>But...but would it be completely outlandish to believe that Kyuubi might have something to say? Naruto shook his head, wondering where this sudden trust for one of his worst enemies came from. It's not even like...well Kyuubi <i>did</i> clean of his apartment. And killed Pain. And Naruto was still taking the credit.</p><p>"About what you said earlier..." Naruto said immediately waking the demon up, "About you 'not starting it' what did you mean?"</p><p>The demon yawned and rubbed his eye. "Hmm. I leave you to figure it out."</p><p>"I'm trying to see it from your side you know. Don't play games if you want me to understand," Naruto said glaring.</p><p>"It's more than you are willing to listen to. Let's leave it at that."</p><p>"I can't believe this. Why don't I just chalk it up to you lying?"</p><p>"Have I ever lied to you?"</p><p>"You lie all the time! You lied earlier when I was fighting Pain!"</p><p>"I <i>would've</i> taken your pain away you know. You may not agree with the method or the result, but I assure you the pain would've been gone. HAHAHAHA!"</p><p>Naruto gritted his teeth and immediately stomped to and sat at the table. He picked up a beginner scroll and focused all of his attention to it. How stupid. Giving Kyuubi a chance to explain himself. Completely stupid. Ignore him, he thought. Just ignore him. But he couldn't. Not when he heard Kyuubi walk up beside him.</p><p>"Go away," he demanded not looking away from the scroll in his hands.</p><p>"Let me help you."</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Come on."</p><p>"No Kyuubi!" And then the monster had the gall to ignore him and reach for one of the many scrolls anyway. Naruto swiftly smacked his hand away. But Kyuubi even ignored that and grabbed a scroll with his other hand. Naruto had enough. Standing up he shouted,</p><p>"NO! PUT THAT BACK!"</p><p>"I just want to help," Kyuubi smiled in what was obviously supposed to be a kind, disarming smile. Naruto saw right through it.</p><p>"You're only going to 'help' yourself! You <i>know </i>you aren't trying to get sealed back into me."</p><p>"Well <i>you</i> know it'll take forever for any progress to be made on your own," Kyuubi shrugged. "Meanwhile I am perfectly willing to do research of my own and sell you the information I get."</p><p>"Wha-? Sell?!"</p><p>"Yes Naruto. I research and help you figure out seal knowledge and I will tell you what I find out for a price."</p><p>"Forget it!" He yelled reaching out to grab the scroll Kyuubi held. Kyuubi held it out of reach and with an annoyed expression on his face he said,</p><p>"I am NOT going to sit here and do nothing!"</p><p>"You might as well do nothing for all the help you're going to be. You must be the biggest idiot in the world if you think I'm going to believe you suddenly had a change heart and want to help!"</p><p>Naruto jumped for the scroll again but Kyuubi jumped away just as quickly. The monster had a stupidly annoying playful grin on his face, as if this was fun time or something. And Naruto, thinking about the time he was wasting try to get the scroll back, was getting the increasing urge to make his next leap not involve grabbing the scroll, but knocking Kyuubi out. In fact, why not?</p><p>"Maybe a change of heart is a bit of stretch-!" Damn. Naruto leaped towards him again but apparently Kyuubi was doing more than cleaning when Naruto was away. There's no way he could be this fast. He certainly wasn't before. Kyuubi continued what he was saying.</p><p>"But certainly you could believe that I want a thrill."</p><p>"What thrill-urgh!" Damn it! Damn it! Naruto thought as he failed yet again to stop Kyuubi. His apartment isn't even that big when you don't include the bathroom and the training room. And they're exactly the same size. This shouldn't be so hard.</p><p>"The thrill of fighting a worthy opponent. Not sure if you understand since I'm sure your fight, if you can call it that, with the Uch-"</p><p>"It's only a thrill if you know you're going to come out on top! I'm not a fool Kyuubi don't treat me as if I'm dumb!" And to prove it, Naruto paused in his attacking and started trying to plan a more efficient way to get Kyuubi to stop moving. Shadow clones of course.</p><p>"Oh but you are. Rude too. And you do know that there is also a thrill that comes with the unknown. I mean come on. I may be insanely confident in my abilities and knowledge over yours but despite that you are the only one in this village, with a name that I know and is alive, that I feel can actually cause me some trouble. That's a compliment Naruto so you better take it as one."</p><p>A compliment from Kyuubi? Now that is low. With renewed vigor he used shadow clone jutsu to surround the demon. It was actually pretty comical seeing Kyuubi's eyes widen and hold on the scroll tighten.</p><p>"Damn it Naruto!" He shouted looking half-nervously half-angrily at the clones surrounding him. He hunched over a little and with his hair standing up on end Kyuubi really did sort of resemble a fox on guard. Kind of sad since he was wearing Naruto's face.</p><p>But for the first time since this whole fiasco started, Naruto felt happy. His clones grinned determinedly and the original Naruto let out a laugh of triumph.</p><p>"Surrender now Kyuubi or we'll dogpile you!"</p><p>His moment of glory was sort of ruined when his clones started shouting agreements and threats and pleads to actually dogpile Kyuubi and Naruto had to tell them to shut up before someone heard them. But still Kyuubi dropped the scroll and the scowl on his face looked more like a pout at a plan gone wrong than a serious 'I-will-kill-you' expression.</p><p>Naruto happily took his time walking up to the demon and picking up the scroll at his feet. When he stood up they were chest to chest and Naruto smirked because he won that little battle. Kyuubi glared a little harder but the blond ninja turned around and walked back towards his table. Once he was out of range, his clones proceeded to jump on Kyuubi.</p><p>The THUMP, the '"OW! NARUTO!" and even his clones' laughter had Naruto smiling and laughing for real.</p><p>"Well I'm in a good mood so I'll let you sleep in here tonight. Allow me to get at least <i>some</i> reading done and I'll even give you a blanket and pillow for you to curl up with <i>under</i> my bed hehe," Naruto snickered. He heard Kyuubi grunt a little as the fox shoved his head out of the pile of clones.</p><p>"I'd rather sleep outside then enjoy your so-called hospitality!" He spat. But Naruto couldn't take it seriously. So he just shrugged and said,</p><p>"As you like. But I am really hungry now so would you like to eat dirt too or do you want some real food?"</p><p>Kyuubi closed his eyes and looked away with a "humph!"</p><p>Still with a smile on his face Naruto decided to let him pout and went about making his ramen. It isn't long before he heard Kyuubi start whining.</p><p>"Hey! Get rid of your stupid clones this is uncomfortable!" Naruto heard Kyuubi struggle a bit and in response his clones let out a collective "naaaaah!" and Naruto chuckled again when he turned around to see the 'fight' that Kyuubi was obviously losing.</p><p>"I don't think so. They're having fun and I don't trust you to come and grab something again. So you are going to lie there, behave, and wait until I finish dinner and get some studying done. Then I'll lock all this stuff away so that you can't get them and <i>then</i> I'll disperse the clones."</p><p>"Grrr you're as annoying as ever when you're happy! I want you upset again!"</p><p>"Too bad! Now shut up I need to pay attention to this scroll and this water. I'm going to actually gain some knowledge before tomorrow."</p><p>Kyuubi grumbled a little but otherwise didn't bother the original Naruto. Instead he spent his time snapping his teeth at the clones who kept poking him and messing up his already messed-up hair. The sight was kind of funny and Naruto could only wish he could dedicate more time to watching it.</p><p>But he needed to focus and there would be other times where he could do this. After all he still had all of his and Kyuubi's chakra so making the shadow clones isn't that big of a deal. But right, time to focus. The sooner he gets the basics of sealing down the sooner he can get to the real stuff.</p><p>He did want to follow through with his word and have Kyuubi back inside of him within the year. Even if he couldn't make a promise on it.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>And finished with another chapter!</p><p>Yeah I don't know why the ending gave me so much trouble before. I mean for the past two days all these ideas kept coming to me and it was suddenly so easy! Boy writer's block is weird D:.</p><p>Anyways hehe my note at the top had a double meaning :P! And I told you the fighting would tone down soon! It will just take a while(if ever) for it to stop completely.</p><p>So if anyone's confused I'd like to say that most of the villagers that saw Kyuubi's chakra see it how Sakura sees it. Kyuubi started to get loose but Naruto took control and stopped him and then killed Pain. That's why they see him as a hero, because he did what he was supposed to do as a jinchuuriki and then killed Pain. Everyone else is like the boy, didn't see nuthin but heard the rumors.</p><p>Some things:</p><p>1) Naruto's grieving for his dead teachers is something that will pop up every now and then but I'll try not to over do it or something. Realistically, I think it would take him awhile to get over their deaths(especially in such a short time frame). And that will happen in this story, but Naruto's got so much going on that he's going to try and separate it all and do whatever is appropriate at the time.</p><p>2) Don't know if I said this but I wasn't super upset at Pain reviving everyone in the manga lol. I kind of just went with the flow. So no this isn't a response to that, it just fit in the story XD.</p><p>3) Naruto's feelings for Sakura and Hinata's feelings for Naruto(and to that extent Sakura's feelings) are still in the planning stages. Dunno yet how much of an impact they'll have on everything.</p><p>And...yeah I think that's it.</p><p>So about what's coming next: I have a small idea for the beginning of the next chapter, but obviously I have other things to update first.</p><p>Cheater Cheater and Little Terror I am aiming to update next. CC is practically done, just need my beta's opinion and then editing. And Little Terror still has a lot more writing to go but at this point screw my insecurities. I'll just write, write, and keep on writing :P. Beta can help there too obviously. And finally after that is Salvation and then Seas and Anything That Can Go Wrong. And then we start all over with October 10th again.</p><p>To get all of my stories updated in January would be amazing but I won't make any promises :X.</p><p>But yeah to end this long-ass note:</p><p>HAPPY NEW YEAR!(Can't believe it's been a whole year 0_0.)</p><p>May twenty-thirteen be in your favor :)!</p>
