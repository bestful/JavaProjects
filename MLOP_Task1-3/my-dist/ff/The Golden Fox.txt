His blue eyes slowly opening, the last thing he remembers is the pain from the drunken villagers beating and slashing him with various weapons before he fainted. The question now was where he was now he sat up and looked around the area. He was in a sewer like tunnel, water flooded the floor. He looked down at his reflection in the murky water, his spiky blonde hair was wet from laying in the water moments ago, his whisker marks giving him a foxy appearance. 5 years old Naruto Uzamaki, the nine tails fox container, stood and started walking in a random direction hopefully finding a way out of this unsettling place.</P><P>After what seemed like hours of walking Naruto came to a room where he couldn't even see the ceiling, in the center of the room was a giant iron gate being held together by a single piece of paper with the kanji for the word 'seal' written on it. "where am I?" The five year old asked quietly to himself. As if on cue a pair of giant red eyes opened behind the iron bars.</P><P><B>"You are in your mind"</B> The giant voice boomed.<B>" and my prison."</B> He spit out the last part in distaste. Most would have fled the room in an attempt to get as far away from the blood red eyes as possible, but the young blonde moved closer to the bars so far as to stick his head through them to try and get a better look at what lies behind them seeing noting but the giant eyes. The darkness in the cage felt alive, he moved away not liking the way the eyes looked at him.</P><P>"You said I was in my mind, well how did I get here and what are you?" He kept backing up until he was back against the wall, the eyes following him looking at him like he looked at ramen right before he ate it.</P><P><B>"You passed out from the pain of the beating you received from the flesh bags that think your me."</B> The eyes moved closer to the bars until he could see the nose of some canine, a wolf maybe.</P><P>"They think I'm you...who are you?"</P><P>A bright flash from the nonexistent ceiling lite up the room. The light hurt Naruto's eyes from being in the dark for so long he shielded his eyes with his arm until he could stand the bright lights. Behind the bars was a giant red fox with nine flowing red, black tipped tails. The boys eyes widened at the sight before him never in his five years had he seen something this outstanding.<B>"I am the Kyuubi no Kitsune, the nine tailed demon fox the greatest of all the tailed beasts and the strongest being in existence."</B> The fox stated with pride. The young blonde continued to stare at the mountainous beast.<B>"what are you staring at you worthless pile of shit?"</B></P><P>Naruto finally snapped out of his trance and busted out laughing causing the fox to get agitated. <B>"what the hell are you laughing at brat?" </B>the fox attempted to swipe at the laughing boy but a blue barrier from the seal knocked his attack back.</P><P>Naruto tears forming in his eyes from the laughter spoke in a broken sentence."hahaha how can haha you ha be the strongest haha b-being if haha you are stuhahack haha inside me hahaha?" He was rolling on the floor water splashing under him as he did so.</P><P><B>"SILENCE!"</B> Kyuubi roared with so much force sending Naruto into the wall behind him knocking him out again.<B> "damn it."</B> The fox stood up and popped its neck. <B>"kit wake up...kit...KIT..."</B> after no reply he forced the water on the ground to form a wave and sent it towards the unconscious boy.</P><P>The wave knocked the boy around him coughing and spitting out water after it receded. "What the *cough* heck is *cough* wrong with you." Naruto stared at the giant fox with a very unhappy look. The blonde lowered his gaze and heard his stomach growl in need of some ramen. "well it was nice meeting you kyuubi-san, but I've really got to get going." He gave a fake smiled and turned to leave the way he came but found the entrance gone.</P><P><B>"Not so fast kit we need to discuss something,"</B> Kyuubi lowered down to it could be eye to eye with Naruto...close enough at least.<B> "You want to be a ninja right?"</B> The blonde nodded his head. <B>"Okay so here's the deal I will not have my host be a weak embarrassment to the world so ill give you some of my chakra in return for some freedom from time to time and ill even teach you a thing or two when your able to use jutsues and graduate from the academy...why are you looking at me like that?"</B></P><P>"Deal!"The blonde boy could hardly control himself, not only was he going to learn some jutsues but the strongest being(he snickered when he said that in his mind) was going to train him...he could hardly wait.</P><P><B>"Also I'm giving you the summoning scroll for foxes, the first ever able to do so,"</B> The fox channeled his chakra into the outside of the cage forcing a pedestal with a red scroll laying on top. "just bloody your hand and place it on the scroll."</P><P>The blonde did as instructed, his bloody hand print formed until it spelled Uzamaki-Namikaze Naruto. He stared at his name on the scroll wondering how the scroll got his name wrong."Ummmm, Kyuubi, the scroll spelled my name wrong it put the fourths last name," The blonde looked up at the giant fox.</P><P>"..." Kyuubi stared at the boy for a while then let out a sigh. <B>"The reason it says that is bec-..."</B> The fox was cut off by another voice that came from the ceiling.</P><P>"Naruto, wake up...Naruto, please wake up" The both knew the voice, the boy knew him as his semi-grandfather, and the fox from Naruto's memory's.</P><P><B>"Well kit, I guess its time for you to wake up</B>," The fox looked at the blonde one last time before he Naruto started to fade away <B>"we'll talk again and ill answer your question."</B></P><P>A/N: I know its short but its just the prologue to the main story ill try to make all the chapters a lot longer. Any suggestions yall could give me would be a major help to me for the remaining chapters.</P><P>Kyuubi: "<B>You should have made it longer"</B></P><P>GoldenFox1885: "Yea I know but its just the prologue and I was in a hurry to get something out so I just went ahead and threw this out there"</P><P>Kyuubi:<B> "The beginning is what catches the readers eye, if you let me out of the boy right now I would help you together we would rule the world."</B></P><P>GoldenFox1885: "You'll get out soon enough most likely in chapter 3 after Naruto gets back from his training trip with the pervert"</P><P>Kyuubi: <B>"Fine, but I want a lot of screen time got it"</B></P><P>GoldenFox1885: "Typical woman always has to be in the spot light"</P><P>Kyuubi: <B>"Hey no one was supposed to know I was a woman just yet, now you went and ruined to big surprise" </B></P><P>GoldenFox1885: "Oh my bad well I suppose the cat is out of the bag or should I say the fox is out of the bag haha best joke ever...right</P><P>Kyuubi:<B> "Typical male always making bad jokes" *leaves the room*</B></P><P>GoldenFox1885: "It wasn't that bad... hello/...damn, alone again. Well GoldenFox1885 over and out.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer: I do not own Naruto...yet.</P><P>A/N: Hey guys or gals, GoldenFox1885 here with the another chapter of The Golden Fox this one will be a bit longer than the prologue, this chapter is basically a few days before Naruto and Jiraya get back to the village after their training trip, so yea a major time skip in the story but every thing in between the prologue and here is basically the same in the manga and anime but any differences will be in flashbacks so on that note lets get the story started.</P><P>Kyuubi:<B> "you stole one of AntVenoms intro's didn't you?"</B></P><P>GoldenFox1885: "what?...Noooo." *closes tab with youtube on it.*</P><P>Kyuubi: <B>"You fucking liar! You just changed a few words and phrases."</B></P><P>GoldenFox1885: "don't you have a story to be in?"</P><P>Kyuubi: <B>-_-..."this isn't over." *walks off*</B></P><P>GoldenFox1885:*whispers* "its over when I say its over."</P><P>Kyuubi: <B>"I heard that."</B></P><P>GoldenFox1885: "...leave!... okay finally shes gone so heres the story enjoy."</P><p style="text-align:center;"><B>New Outfit, Foxes, and... pink sandals?</B></P><P>"Do I really have to do this?" Asked a crestfallen Naruto.</P><P>"Hey. your the one that wanted to make the bet that I couldn't get into that blonde chicks pants, plus they don't look that bad on you they go good with your new outfit." Snickered Jiraya, the legendary toad sannin and the author of the best selling series Icha Icha. "Hardly any one will see you any way we only have like 8 more villages to visit before we get back to the leaf."</P><P>Naruto was now in a black short sleeve with the Uzamaki spiral on it, a white cloak (kinda like the one from his battle with pain) on the back of the cloak was a red fox with nine tails that spread out over the cloak, his head band was now tied to his arm, his pants were black and had two red lines going down the pants leg on either side, his hair was a bit longer and resembled the fourth hokages hair, his cerulean blue eyes now had bits of red specks, and was wearing his recently acquired pink sandals via losing a bet. But the most noticeable feature (not really a feature but didn't really no what else to call it) was the two red and white foxes beside him.</P><P>The red fox came first, after his battle with Sasuke at the valley of end he woke up in the hospital and it was just there curled in a ball on his lap, Tsunade said that it had just appeared over night and would chase off the nurses that came into the room but let all his closest friends enter the room but not touch him, with the exception of Tsunade because lets face it she scares the living shit out of everyone. The white fox came right after he went berserk into two tailed fox form. There was a third black fox but it ran off right after it appeared. They both had different attributes the red was more violent and aggressive while the white was more playful. The black was shy...just guessing.</P><P>The foxes stared at Naruto's new sandals and made a noise like they were snickering. "See even the mini demons think they look good on you" said Jiraya in a sarcastic tone. The blonde looked at him with hatred. "okay enough fun we have to get going, busy schedule for the next few days" in his mind all busy meant was precious "research".</P><P>Naruto knew that he would once again be roaming the streets waiting for Jiraya to finish his "research". Its not all that bad, usually girls would just approach him, marvel at his two companions, and want to spend the rest of the day with him. He once had to pry a girl off of him after she jumped him and started trying to rape him, he then had to hide in his hotel room for the rest of the day, he had never seen a girl rip someones clothes off that fast, not even in one of the old perverts novels. Yes he had read one or two of the famous Icha Icha... okay all off them, Jiraya had said it was part of his training but all he got out of it was wasted time he could have spent training...and a boner or two...or more. He couldn't really say that they were terrible, actually they were well written and very descriptive, but to be like some people and just walk around while reading them not saying any names coughKakashicough is just to far. He could still remember the time Jiraya made him read or look basically at the all picture book, he never knew you could use a kunia and shurikens that way.</P><P>Looking at the small foxes reminded him of the talk he had with Kyuubi when he was a kid, after that night he had talked to her only once after he joined the academy then she started acting all pissed off at him and wouldn't even say hardly two words only gave him some of her chakra when he needed it then he wouldn't hear from her until he was desperate for her chakra again. He actually missed the being that had caused him so much pain and suffering when he was younger. After the second visit he had learned that he was the son of the fourth hokage and Kushina Uzamaki, that Minato sealed the raging fox inside of him sacrificing himself so Naruto would be seen as a hero, only he was seen as the demon itself. Back then she he thought of her as his only friend and then Sasuke came along, at first Naruto hated the young Uchiha but slowly they formed a strange brotherly bond then like that it was gone, taken by that bastard Orochimaru, the legendary snake sannin and the one that took away his brother and his adoptive grandson. Of course he thought Sakura was his friend but hell she didn't even come to see him in the hospital after the battle with Sasuke, now she blamed him for Sasuke getting away.</P><P>"Fuck my life," the young blonde stated, rising from his crouched position and dusting the dirt off his clothes. "Pervy sage how long till the next village?" The older of the two was in his own world staring off into the setting sun, after no reply Naruto turned his back towards the old pervert "fuck you to then, I guess we're setting up camp here tonight." After about an hour of setting up camp for the night, Jiraya finally snapped out of it.</P><P>Jiraya stood up and started stretching, his bones popping from sitting in one position for so long. "Hey kid we should set up camp for the night," Naruto pointed at the already assembled tents "okay well I'm going to go hunt for some food." Again Naruto pointed to a fire with four rabbits cooking on a rotisserie. "Damn kid you thought of everything."</P><P>"Well someone has to be the adult here," Naruto said going over to the fire and turning the turning the rabbits. "so what were you thinking about over there?" Jiraya stared at him for a then just turned away and went inside the tent and lied down. Naruto watched him go then looked at the two foxes. "was it something I said?" The two foxes seemed to shrug then went over to the fire anxiously waiting for the rabbits to finish cooking.</P><P>The rabbits were done after ten more minutes of cooking, although, not the best meal in Narutos opinion it was still good, the foxes seemed to think so, even Jiraya came out of the tent and devoured the rabbits the grease dripping down his chin. "Pervy sage, slow down your acting like you haven't eaten in days." Naruto watched the man eat and speak at the same time only catching stop calling me that and I'm hungry everything else was lost from the mouthful of food.</P><P>It was dark before they finished eating, the moon hide behind a cloud leaving the fire as their only source of light. Naruto watched as the white fox nipped at the reds ear then jump back and yip at him only to be ignored which caused him to do it over and over again. "Naruto, how much do you know about your parents?" Jiraya was staring at the two foxes also.</P><P>"Well I know that my dad was Minato Namikaze, the fourth hokage, and my mother was Kushina Uzamaki, from the land of wirlpools, that they sacraficed them selves to seal Kyuubi inside of me to stop her from destroying the village." The news didn't surprise Jiraya Naruto had told him about his conversation with Kyuubi, Jiraya had suggested that he not speak with her again.</P><P>"Did you know that your mother was the last container of the fox before you?"</P><P>"Yes but she didn't ever use Kyuubi's power" Naruto replied</P><P>Jiraya was silent once more he just stared at the young blonde for awhile before speaking again. "Okay." with that he once again retreaded to his tent.</P><P>Naruto watched him go then turned to the foxes. "Now what did I say?" The foxes looked from him to the tent then back to him. The white one jumped in his lap and the red one went and sat by the fire. He had learned that the fox were a lot like the common dog at least these were they loved to be scratched and rubbed even the red one who tried to act all tough, melted in his lap when behind the ear. But how would he explain the foxes to the village, sure other villages just thought of them as regular ninja summons but his village already though of him as the Kyuubi reincarnated, returning returning with foxes would seem a little suspicious. Maybe he could convince them it was a coincidence or he could try to hide them... yea right.</P><P>He could here Jiraya shuffling around in his tent most likely whacking off to the endless porn he carried in a sealing scroll. He had found them by accident when Jiraya told him to grab the red one only there was two soooo when he unsealed the one he chose about 300 sticky magazines was what he got, he would never go into Jiraya's tent again. EVER!</P><P>He laughed at that as gross as it was Naruto was going to miss the times Jiraya and him had on their training trip learning to control the foxes chakra even though he had lost control once or twice he didn't get to talk to Kyuubi, its like he had said something wrong and now he couldn't even apologize or fix it. He was supposed to let her have some freedom in exchange for a bit of training and the summoning scroll which had to be defective because he didn't even summon them and he couldn't even desummon them.</P><P>He had learned that he could remember what his shadow clones saw and did, which made his training a whole lot easier. Although he still couldn't do the rasengan without a shadow clone he had started the whole rasengan balloon training all over again. He would sent about 1000 clones to work on it then when one would pop the balloon he would dispel them and keep trying hoping to perfect it. But it was still in progress. In the middle of his thoughts he heard another shuffle from Jirayas tent maybe it was time to go to sleep himself...nah he was to hyped up to sleep. Naruto walked to the edge of the woods and just stared into the darkness "Well guess I better get started" with that he jumped onto the top of the trees and bolted into darkness.</P><P>A/N: Hey I know this one is still short but with school starting up in a couple of weeks things have been real busy and my girlfriend is wanting to hang out more and more so not as much time to work on it as I thought I would have. But Kyuubi will be in the next chapter a little more human than last time and more free. Hopefully I can make the next ones longer but I just wanted to get this one out fast and not be like some people and stop in the middle of a story and never finish it that makes me so mad but anyway I should have the next chapter in a week or two done but if not blame my girlfriend...or school well I guess thats all GoldenFox1885 out.</P>
