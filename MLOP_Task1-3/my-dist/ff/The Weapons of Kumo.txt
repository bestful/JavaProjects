running, well more a desperate crawl. He could vaguely remembered
running northeast that was five days ago, far as he could tell.
Naruto was numb, in every sense of the word he was numb, mind, body,
spirit. Naruto was lost to the world for all intensive purposes. All
Naruto could think was to keep running, just keep running, never stop
running, because to stop running would mean he would have to face
what he had done he would not stop. As it seamed the Kyuubi wanted
him to keep moving, every time the world would start to turn black he
would get a pulse of chakra from the fox. Naruto took it as a cue to
keep moving, so he did just that. Naruto couldn't do it anymore,
there was a constant stream of chakra coming to him and he still
couldn't keep going, Naruto collapsed to the ground, done, over, his
body forcing his brain into a coma.</p><P>"<B>Naruto you
are so close to help please get up." </B>Kyuubi begged pulsing
chakra to his brain trying to force him awake. <B>"Nibi can
help, Please! wake up." </B>Kyuubi then tried something she had
never tried before she just let go of her power just let it flow
freely into Naruto.</p><P>Naruto's eyes shot
open immediately awake. But why he knew not because there was only
pain. Pain like nothing else existed rain through Naruto's body, like
a small sun Naruto shone with power. Growing larger in size the
massive orb of chakra raged, it size steadily increasing. Screams of
pure agony could be heard over the roaring of the chakra 
dispensation.</p><P>Nibi felt her
master, as always she was amazed Kyuubi-sama was the definition of
power and grace. <B>'Kitten, we must go now to the chakra source!
MOVE!" </B>Nibi screamed at her jailer who was rooted to the
spot with fear.</p><P>What is this
chakra? What is capable of creating such sinister chakra. Yugito
couldn't move her body wouldn't do it. every muscle was screaming to
turn and run. She could feel herself let Nibi take control. Yugito
knew Nibi would save them for if she died so did Nibi.</p><P><B>'Something is
wrong with Kyuubi-sama's Chakra, Its different?' </B>Nibi thought as
she came up to the massive orb of chakra which was forcefully
removing the foliage from around her.</p><P>The massive
ball of energy ended abruptly. in the center was a massive fox but it
wasn't Kyuubi. this fox was 50 feet tall at least, It was a pure
black in color with crimson paws, tail tip and ear tips. It had seven
massive tails swinging ideally behind it.</p><P>Blazing red eyes
locked onto Nibi/Yugito. To say the least Nibi was scared.<B> 'This
is not Kyuubi-sama, how could i have mistaken it. I could die here
because of this mistake!' </B>She thought. only noticing the fox open
its mouth.</p><P><B>"Why are
you so small?" </B>Naruto said in a very low, very commanding
voice.</p><P>Nibi's sweat
dropped at this as she watch the emotions play across its eyes.
surprised,(looked down), more surprise, anger. Killing intent like
nothing other than Kyuubi itself could produce came off the fox.</p><P><B>"BAKA
KITSUNE WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO ME??!!!??!!!" </B>Naruto
screamed at the top of his lungs. Which happened do be very load
indeed.</p><P>A small red
fox with two tails and a black collar walked out from behind his
right ear and stared wide eyed. "I don't know?" The small
fox said in awe at her creation.</p><P>Fifteen minutes
later.</p><P>Naruto stood up
amazed after talking to Kyuubi and Nibi/Yugito in a rationalized
tone, meaning having to be bitten on the ear by said kitsune, he had
been able to mold his body into that of his previous one with a few
major differences. The first thing Naruto notice was he could see,
hear, smell everything around him it was amazing. Naruto looked at
his hands and noticed that he had claws, a quick experiment told him
the were razor sharp. A black tail with a blood red tip floated past
his range of sight . Naruto looked behind him and gasped he had seven
tails in this form to. How was he supposed to live with other people
if he had tails. To say the least it was not normal to have seven
black tails.</p><P>Nibi deemed that
this boy was safe and gave control back to her jailer. It was painful
for her to stay in control.</p><P>Yugito looked up
and gasped. before her was a boy who looked to be about fifteen. he
had black hair with red highlights. His eyes, they were a blazing
inferno, a living flame behind his black slitted pupil. she ripped
her gaze from his eyes to scan his body. He had no shirt on. each
muscle scream power and flexibility. His chest was sculpted that was
the only word for it. above his right pectoral there was a tattoo of
a black fox with seven tails with red tips. He had on baggy cargo
pants. His tattoo matched his tails perfectly.</p><P>"What are
you!?" Yugito asked suddenly braking the silence between them.</p><P>"Are you ok
Nibi?" Naruto asked back</p><P>"What? I'm not
Nibi I'm Yugito!" Yugito said in a rush she didn't like that
he knew her demon. Though he didn't give her a look of disgust. "How
do you know of my burden?" Yugito asked rather snappishly.</p><P>"Um...I was
just talking to her for the last fifteen minutes trying to figure out
how to get my human body back." Naruto said as though it was the
most normal thing in the world to talk to a blood thirsty demon and
ask it for advice. "She mentioned you and tried to explain how
you take her form and turn back again. When that didn't work,
Kyuubi-sama" he motioned over to his left were a small fox with
two tails stood up and walked over "explained how her clan takes
there human form." Again he looked at the fox and watched as it
burst into flames.</p><P>When the flames
vanished a women slightly shorter than Naruto walked over. She Had
fire red hair in a braid to her mid back. She had the same eyes as
Naruto and a godlike figure. She was very beautiful Yugito thought as
she looked over again at Naruto.</p><P>"I know that I
can take my other form but i refuse to take it. I am no demon!"
Yugito spat vehemently.</p><P>"I'm sorry
that was uncalled for. It's just that i now have a second form and i
just thought that it was nice that I wasn't the only one, and I want
to train it, there was so much power no one would attack me if i
could fight in that form.</p><P><B>"Don't get
arrogant. It will be years before you are at Nibi-chan's level."
</B>Kyuubi added her two cents.</p><P>It was still a
shock to Naruto that the greatest of the Bijuu was female. 'Though it
makes sense, almost all men of power have a stronger women behind
them.' Naruto thought thinking of his friend Shikamaru's mom and dad.
Kyuubi face matched her hair for a second. It was gone before anyone
saw.</p><P>A frown made its
way to Naruto's face as he remembered that he could never go back to
the village of his birth.</p><P>In Yugito's head</p><P><B>"Kitten,
this boy is powerful. From my talk with Kyuubi-sama he will never be
allowed back in his village. He is also very protective of those that
are close to him. He is kind even though his village beat him hated
him and tried to kill him repeatedly he never slipped into
depression. He is very strong. I suggest that you take him with you
to Kumogakure. I believe he can make living there not so painful."
</B>Nibi said the last with regret confusing Yugito.</p><P>"Why do
you care for this boy, yet scream for the blood of everyone else?"
Yugito was slightly upset and even more confused why Nibi had called
The fox with two tails Kyuubi-sama, Also why this boy was special
enough for the Great Nibi no Nekomata to except and want to be
around.</p><P><B>"I don't
know what happened exactly, but he was the jinchuuriki of Kyuubi No
Youko. Now it looks like they have separated completely except for
there mental link. I don't know how this was done but if they could
separate themselves and I belive they could teach us how to do it.
With the mental link intact Kyuubi-sama told me that Naruto still has
complete control over her but lets here keep her free will. So you
wouldn't have to worry about me going ape shit and killing everyone,
though it would be fun. Anyway I thought that that was something you
would like to do, given the circumstances." </B>Nibi finished
off with an offhanded wave like it didn't really matter to her.</p><P>Yugito knew
Nibi wanted to get out and see the world again, and not just kill,
she knew Nibi wanted roll in the grass, lay in the sun, sleep all day
though she did the last one already it just wasn't the same and
Yugito knew it. 'Ok, i will take them with us.' Yugito sighed it was
going to be a bitch to teach the runt how to hid his tails. it was a
bitch to hid hers. It had still taken her five years with the
motivation of being freed and not killed.</p><P><I>Flashback</I></p><P><I>Yugito sat
crying in the corner of her very small concrete room alone in the
dark. a light turned on. Yugito looked up at her visitor with blazing
yellow-green eyes with slitted pupils. Cat eyes. her two tail wrapped
tightly around her stomach. the man spoke slowly as if to a toddler
thought she was 4 years old she still knew how to talk by listening
to the guards outside.</I></p><P><I>"I see you
haven't been able to make yourself less of a demon. You are worthless
you have a year or you die never having seen the sun. If you want out
then you will have to get rid of the tails. We will kill you if you
don't, No matter who your father is 'Demon'." they laughed and
threw a kunai at her. Yugito immediately jumped to the side and
hissed at them, only causing them to laugh harder.</I></p><P><I>"Cut them
off or you will never go outside and you will be killed in a year as
a failed test subject with no name!" They spat on her and left
slamming the door behind them. After that Yugito had started
practicing even harder to hide her tails eventually after figuring
out that she could form chakra around her tails and essentially make
them invisible to the naked eye she was released and started training
as the perfect weapon of Kumo. </I></p><P>That
particular genjutsu was a bitch to learn and even harder to master
but he would have to if he wanted to live in Kumo.</p><P>"Naruto?
Would you like to come to Raikou No Sato with me?" Yugito asked
tentatively</p><P>"Really you
mean it, you would take me with you?" Naruto asked practically
jumping with excitement. But it didn't last long Naruto frowned and
looked at the ground. he knew the people would still be the same now
that he had tails.</p><P>"What about my
tails people will just call me demon and hate me like my old
village." Naruto said looking at the ground</p><P>there was a tapping
on Naruto's head and he looked up and gasped. there in front of him
Yugito stood two black cat tails with purple streaks.</p><P>"Y...y..you
have tails to?" Naruto asked stuttering.</p><P>"Hai, I do. My
village tried to get me to cut them off myself, but I invented a
genjutsu that will hide them. It took me five years to master though.
I don't know if you can do it by the time we get to Kumo but by then
we can get a cloak to cover them if you can't." Yugito said with
a smile. Internally she couldn't figure out why she was smiling she
was a weapon and weapons do not have emotions. But this boy, who was
like her. Was happy she was here, he was happy that she wanted him to
come along. She could see this boy as someone important to her but
what was she feeling, everyone was scared of her everyone hated her,
they all wanted her dead. But not this boy he wanted to be with her,
she could see it in his eyes. Oh yes there was power behind those
eyes but an ignorance that would soon be gone, why was the life of
the jinchuuriki fated to be a road of pain and sorrow? Yugito had
asked this question to herself an infinite amount of times the
answer never coming. Something about this boy made her want to be
something other than a weapon like all the other girls.</p><P>"Give me
week." Naruto said with the most addiction smile. Yugito
couldn't help but return it and start walking north.</p><P>"Hey
Yugito-chan can you teach me how to do the genjutsu?" Naruto
asked as he ran to catch up grabbing Kyuubi dragging her behind him.
Who intern voiced her opinion</p><P>"Naruto."
Kyuubi said in a sickeningly sweet voice.</p><P>"Yes..."
To say Naruto was scared didn't begin to cover what he was feeling.
He had heard that tone from Tsunade when she was about to make doors
and windows with Jiraiya.</p><P>"Please let go
of <I>my</I> arm before I rip <I>yours</I> off." She said in the
same sickeningly sweet voice. Naruto let go so fast that Kyuubi
didn't even see it. She was slightly impressed as her eyes noticed
everything. "Your getting fast Naruto-kun" '<I><B>FUCK</B></I><I>
I didn't just say kun did I' </I>Kyuubi thought. Though from the shit
eating grin on his face she knew she had. '<I>Damn, so much for being
able to intimidate him' </I>Then Kyuubi had an idea "Naruto I
want you to call me Kyuubi-sensei. I will be teaching you how to
control your demonic chakra and your other form along with
Nibi-chan." Kyuubi said happily</p><P>At this point
Yugito hearing her host name and hearing the complaints her tenant
was saying in her head started to disagree "Um.. Kyuubi-sama."</p><P>"NIBI You will
do what you are told! And Yugito I'm sorry but you will just have
to bare with it until i can unseal Nibi without killing you."</p><P>"Really you
would help me free her?" Yugito yelled shocked</p><P>"Of course she
is a very important and only other friend I have besides naruto
here." Yugito noticed the sorrow in her voice</p><P>"Um could we
get going or at least make camp its getting late." Naruto said
quietly not wanting to piss off the females.</p><P>"We'll make
camp." Kyuubi said her eyes void of emotion.</p><P>Naruto sat by the
pit fire staring blankly. His eyes unfocused,Yugito moved to ask if
he was alright only to be heald back by Kyuubi. "Leave him for
now, Naruto has committed unforgiveable acts against the people he
had promised to protect. Give him time to process and except what he
has done."</p><P>"What did he
do?" Yugito ask</p><P>"That Yugito,
is something that you must hear from Naruto, I will not betray his
trust, ever." The finality in Kyuubi's voice startled Yugito.
The strongest and most feared of all the Bijuu would not betray this
boy, this boy who jumped at the opportunity to come with her. This
boy who had genuinely wanted to spend his time with her. Yugito vowed
to herself then and there that she would never betray his trust. They
were hated, they were alone. Yugito would not let him be alone
anymore she would stay with him,</p><P>Naruto was thinking
back to the day he had left Konoha.</p><P><I>Flashback</I></p><P><I>Naruto had
returned from the valley of the end empty handed and half dead
dragging his broken and battered body. all around him the villagers
offered no help. Naruto wanted nothing more then to hide away in his
apartment though he knew he would have to face the council soon.
Naruto dragged himself to his bedroom and drifted to the blissful
serenity of unconsciousness. Naruto awoke to smoke drifting through
his apartment. immediately Naruto shot out of bed. 'Kyuubi what is
happening' Naruto mental asked his prisoner. </I></p><P><I><B>'From the
looks of it the villagers decided that you need to be burned alive in
your own home'</B></I><I> Kyuubi said with slight hesitation. </I></p><P><I>'What aren't you
telling me?' Naruto asked slightly scared as the smoke grew thicker. </I></p><P><I><B>'I feal
somthing im not sure what it is but you need to get out of here now!'
</B></I><I>Kyuubi said with no room for argument. Though Naruto was
agreeing before she even finish.</I></p><P><I>Naruto ran to
his front door and tried to open it. It wouldn't budge an inch.
taking a running start he slammed his shoulder into it Naruto heard a
loud crack, but from the pain he knew it was from his shoulder not
the door. Grunting in pain Naruto ran back to his room and grabbed a
kunai throwing it at his window as hard as he could, it was reflected
back into the room with out so much as a scratch.</I></p><P><I>'Kyuubi what the
hell is going on!!' Naruto screamed in his head</I></p><P><I><B>'Naruto
there is a chakra barrier that is as strong as the one Orochimaru's
guard used to keep out the ANBU around your house. There are powerful
ninja keeping you in here. There is a way to escape but i don't think
you will be able to handle my blood lust at that power level.'</B></I></p><P><I>'what
do i do Kyuubi? i will not die here i have a promises to keep and i
plan on keeping them.' Naruto said thinking he could control the
blood lust." It was hard at one tail but not impossible he
figured he could hold two for long enough to get out. any higher
though he knew he couldn't, he was a hundred percent sure of that.</I></p><P><I><B>'I am
going to give you four tails of power in this state you will run on
instincts alone, are you SURE you want to do this you could kill a
few of the villagers.'</B></I></p><P><I>'FOUR
TAILS!!' was all Naruto had a chance to scream he felt the first
prickle of power flowing into him. Naruto could see only red his
would be killers would die to day. 'Oh yes they were going to die.'
Naruto thought to himself as he began to compress a large ball of
blood and chakra. Naruto watched in amusement as the villagers back
away from his building.</I></p><P><I>"Don't
worry this barrier can keep a Kage trapped you have nothing to fear
from the demon" One of the four ANBU around the building said
with a smirk.</I></p><P><I>Naruto swallowed
the ball of blood and chakra, his body swelling to an unnatural size.
Naruto leaned forward and released the compressed chakra at his
window directly at the villagers and watched in fascination as the
beam of chakra blew through the barrier as if it wasn't even there.
The beam hit the crowed of villagers instantly vaporizing them it
continued on its path of destruction threw the residential section of
Konoha Killing thousands. when the beam ended half of Konoha had
been leveled. Naruto ran and jumped his first initial jump put him a
few miles out side of the city, he ran and did not stop he would
never stop he thought he had done the one thing he never thought he
would do he had killed his fellow leaf villagers and ninja alike he
knew he could never return, so he ran and didn't look back. Naruto
never wanted to stop running.</I></p><P><I>End Flashback</I></p><P>Kyuubi
watched Naruto silently as his face became more and more depressed.
Kyuubi then did something she had never done before. Kyuubi walked
over to Naruto and held him to her chest.</p><P>Naruto's eyes shot
open, only to see Kyuubi holding him. It was enough, all his metal
barriers broke and he cried. Naruto cried harder then he ever had
even through all of the beatings he had never felt so disgusted, so
ashamed, so worthless. He cried in Kyuubi's arms for what seemed like
an eternity. Finally collapsing into unconsciousness. Kyuubi laid
naruto down and wrapped him in Yugito's spare blanket. Then shifted
into her fox form and curled up in his arms. Kyuubi mentally sighed
as he squeezed her and whimpered in his sleep. Even under the
circumstances Kyuubi could get used to the feeling of being in his
arms.</p><P>Yugito watch the
display with awe and confusion but knew it wasn't her place to
interfere, lying down she fell asleep next to Naruto and Kyuubi
basking in the last heat of the fire before drifting into a troubled
sleep herself.</p>
