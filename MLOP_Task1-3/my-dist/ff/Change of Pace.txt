1</p><P>New
team mate</p><P>Naruto
hopped through the trees an unconscious Sasuke in his arms. He had
just fought a tough battle but he won. Naruto was tired very tired he
had a hole the size of a fist in is jacket and on the other side
Sasuke was beaten up worse than Naruto. Naruto was slowly drifting
off to sleep when he saw blurry figure in the distance the figure was
white and green with a small brown figure at it's side before he was
completely out he the figure came to view it was Kakashi and his
talking dog Pakkun.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoO</p><P>Naruto
woke to the smell of strawberries he looked up and saw Sakura sitting
by his bed checking on him. he noticed Shizune and Tsunade there as
well.</p><P>"Naruto,
your awake" Sakura said. Naruto tried to sit up only to fell his
whole body cry with pain</p><P>"No
Naruto you shouldn't move", Said Tsunade as she walked over to
him.</p><P>"Where's
Sasuke and the others"? He asked remembering Shikamaru, Choji,
Neji, Kiba and his dog Akamaru.</p><P>Tsunade
looked to the right as if asking if telling him was a good idea
finally she decided to tell him.</p><P>"Kiba
and Shikamaru only suffered minor injuries..." she paused than
began again "All of Akamaru's paws are broken, Neji and Choji
just came out of Serious conditions..." she paused again</p><P>"And
Sasuke"? Naruto asked hoping his friend was all right.</p><P>"Sasuke
is still unconscious and all serious injuries have been taken care
of". "You need to rest so you can go back to missions".</p><P>"I
guess your right Tsunade-baachan". Said Naruto before he drifted
back to sleep.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoO</p><P>Naruto
sighed it had been a week since he got out of the hospital but they
still wouldn't let him go on missions. He was supposed to meet
Kakashi-sensie today but he hadn't shown up yet. Sakura was sitting a
few feet away she had wanted to go see Sasuke but she figured they
would be going on a mission.</p><P>"Hey
Guys", Came Kakashi's voice. "Sorry I'm Late I got lost on
the road of life".</p><P>"LIAR"!
shouted Naruto and Sakura in unison.</p><P>"So
Kakashi-sensie", Sakura began "Are we going on a mission"?</p><P>"I
guess you could call it that..." "Your mission is to get to
now your new team mate".</p><P>"New
team mate"? Naruto and Sakura asked again in unison.</p><P>"Yes
your new team mate", "To go on mission you have to have a
three man squad you only have two", "So until Sasuke
becomes conscious you have to live with your new team mate".
Sakura, Naruto meet Kirela she is your new team mate".</p><P>Behind
Kakashi was an average hight teenage girl with Long Red hair that
reached the center of her back. She had green colored eyes that in
the light looked highlited with blue she wore a leaf head band on her
neck and she was wearing a fishnet shirt covered by a light blue
jacket and army pants.</p><P>"Hi",
I'm Kirela and you guys are"?</p><P>Sakura
smiled "I'm Sakura Haruno".</p><P>"And
I'm Naruto Uzumaki the next Hokage"!</p><P>end

2</p><p align="center">Bells</p><P>"NANI"!
Naruto screamed when he saw Kakashi pull out 2 small bells. "Were
doing the bells again"?</p><P>"But
Why"? he asked.</p><P>"It's
to figure out if we can work together properly". said Kirela</p><P>Kakashi
blinked even Sasuke didn't understand the bells at first. "Correct
Kirela and were also looking at your skills".</p><P>"So",
Said Sakura "Were after the bells", "And testing our
skills"?</p><P>"Yep
I want to see how much you and Naruto have grown and I'd Like to see
what Kirela is capable of as well".</p><P>"Ready"...</p><P><I>'This
will be easy'!</I>
thought Naruto</p><P>"Set"...</p><P><I>'Just
wait until Sasuke hears I got a bell'! </I>thought
Sakura</p><P>"GO"!</p><P>Everyone
flew toward the tree's and bushes waiting quietly for a chance to
strike</p><P>"Yahh"
cried Naruto as a clone came from the bushes followed by 2 more
clones in the apperance of</p><P>Sakura
and Kirela while the clones fought Kakashi the three Genin met
together to form a plan. After they had formed a plan all three clone
dispersed.</p><P><I>'Up,
Down, Left, Right, ... Down'</I>
Kakashi thought.</p><P>And
as if on cue Naruto came up out of the ground and tried to punch
Kakashi in the chin. As Kakashi dodged Sakura came behind with a
chakra filled kick to his head Kakashi barely doged it as Sakura
whiped around to do a side kick. And right as Kakashi was dodging the
fatal blow Kirela kicked under his feet so that he fell backwards and
as he was falling Naruto took the bells from his side. The three
Genin held the bells up and smiled.</p><P>"Uggh",
Kakashi said rubbing his head and standing up "Well I guess you
win well, who will get the bells"?</p><P>Naruto,
Sakura, and Kirela all had dumb looks on there faces.</p><P>"But
I thought we were done". said Naruto.</p><P>"Yes
you are done and you all pass but who will keep a bell"? "To
see who will keep a bell I will all have you spar each other".
"Is that ok"?</p><P>"Yah"!
said Naruto "I'm gonna prove I'm Hokage material"!</p><P>"Not
unless I prove I'm better". said Kirela starring at Naruto like
he was her rival.</p><P>"Bring
it on". Naruto said back to her.</p><P>"Well
since you two seem like you want to fight be my guest". said
Kakashi.</p><P>Kakashi
stood in between Naruto and Kirela while Sakura stood off to the
side.</p><P>"Let
the match between Uzumaki Naruto and Isukane Kirela begin"!</p><P>"Ahh"
Naruto yelled as he lunged forward his right hand coked back for a
punch he swung his hand going strait for her face but to everyones
surprise she dodged it completely.</p><P>"My
turn". she hummed as she started doing seals "Earth Style
thousand rock jutsu"</p><P>And
just like that pieces of the ground came up and formed one large
stone Kirela picked it up and through it strait for Naruto. It hit
him but with a puff the clone was gone. Then 5 clones came out of
what seemed to be no where and kicked Kirela up into the sky.</p><P>"Na-ru-to
Uzumaki barrage" Yelled Naruto as he kicked Kirela into the
ground with a large thump</p><P>Kirela
looked like she was knocked out and just as Kakashi was about to call
it they heard "Earth style cave trapping no jutsu" Rocks
came up from the ground forming a dome with no exit around Naruto</p><P><I>'Dammit
I can't get out' </I>He
thought still looking around the cave when he noticed a small whole
the size of his fist 'What's that"? He thought and Kirela
answered his question "Summoning Jutsu"</p><P>Naruto
heard Kirela yell <I>'Summoning'?
</I>he
thought then he noticed 5 rattle snakes come into the cave where the
hole was he stepped back toward the rock wall behind him he tried to
make a Rasengan so he could get out but he couldn't.</p><P>"This
Dome", He heard Kirela say "Sucks up your chakra as well as
keeps you from destroying my snakes just try and move and they'll
bite you".</p><P><I>'Crap
what do I do I could use shurikan but there's still a chance I'll
miss one' </I>He
shook his head</p><P><I>'No
there's no way I'll miss'</I>.
He took out 5 shuriken and threw them at the snake's the only thing
that could be heard out side the dome was clanging noises and and
deep breathing.</p><P>"Kai"
said Kirela undoing the jutsu all five snakes were dead but Naruto
was out.</p><P>"The
winner is Isukane Kirela" said Kakashi as he walked up to
Naruto. Kirela face was pale Kakashi thought that she must think she
killed him.</p><P>"He's
asleep".</p><P>"What"?
she asked not catching what he said.</p><P>"He's
asleep and he's regaining chakra as well". Kakashi picked up
Naruto bridal style and put him against a tree to rest.</p><P>"Ok
then now you fight Sakura".</p><P>"Me"!
Sakura asked hoping he was joking</p><P>"Yes
you". He said. "Alright let the match between Isukane
Kirela and Haruno Sakura begin".</p><P>END

said. "Alright let the match between Isukane Kirela and Haruno
Sakura begin"!</I></p><p align="center">Chapter 3</p><p align="center">Medical Ninja
vs Earth Style Ninja</p><P>Sakura shifted her feet
into a good fighting stance while Kirela just stood there waiting.</p><P><I>'I've seen her attacks
she mostly uses Earth she usually uses small attacks to weaken her
opponent then attacks with something deadly to end it...' </I></p><P>While Sakura was thinking
up a plan Kirela was making hand seals Earth style rock clone there
stood three Kirelas they all ran towards the pink haired Kyunoichi
each holding 6 shurikan as one clone threw the shuriken the other two
went to surrond her as the shuriken hit the target a log appeared.</p><P><I>'Substitution jutsu' 
</I>Kierla noticed a pink and red streak then one
of her clones crumbled into rock and sand.</p><P>Sakura was running as fast
as she could when she came up to the redhead she slammed her fist
into the ground making the ground shatter and break she noticed the
ground caving in and as it fell water came into view she had
remembered that there was an underground spring in the area and she
figured if she could see the water that would mean less rock for
Kirela.</p><P>Kirela only had barely
dodged the attack only after realizing Sakuras true intent of making
there be less rock Kirela smirked she didn't know that Sakura was
this smart Kirela lunged forward as her hand covered with rock making
it very hard and if hit by it deadly just as she came towards her
target she felt her right leg and arm freeze they wouldn't move.</p><P>"I've messed with
your arm and leg so your temporarily paralyzed".</p><P>"Good job, but you
forgot I have two hands".</p><P>Then to everyones
amazement except for Naruto who was still sleeping she started doing
one handed seals Earth style imprisonment no jutsu! Sakura's eye's
widened as she realized her arms and legs were trapped in stone
Kirela rushed forward amazing Sakura to no end</p><P><I>'She shouldn't be able
to move let alone run at that speed'!</I> As
Kirela neared Sakura Kakashi stepped in.</p><P>"Thats enough I think
were done for the day it's late go on home the winner is Isukane
Kirela here is your prize". Kakashi said giving her the two
bells</p><P>"Give them to Naruto
and Sakura I don't need them". She said handing one to Sakura
and putting the other one in Naruto's hand. Then she left as she did
so Naruto woke up.</p><P>"What did I miss"?</p><P>I know short but I had to
get it out of the way...</p><P>Were moving so we gotta

(Key-re-ha)</p><P>Note: This is the chapter
about Kirela and since it's supposed 2 be a NarutoxOC pairing</p><P>I thought I would make
Kirela like Naruto and make her have a deamon as well so it's a cat!</p><P>ON WITH DE STORY .</p><P><I>"Thats enough I

Sakura and putting the other one in Naruto's hand. Then she left as
she did so Naruto woke up.</I></p><P><I>"What did I miss"?</I></p><p align="center">Chapter 4</p><p align="center">The eight
tailed neko</p><P>Kirela walked down the
streets of Konoah thinking about the match she had with Sakura and
Naruto she had noticed somthing about Naruto when he was in that rock
dome she had made she felt a strange power that made her angry for
some reason thats why she released the snakes in the dome but then
she felt the power rise and her snakes die so before she went to far
she released the dome but before she did she made shure Naruto had
colasped from chakra depletion she figured it was a good plan and
Kakashi-sensie hadn't seem to notice so everything was good.</p><P>This brought her to a
different memory of when she was little after her mother had abandon
her and she was left alone on the streets.</p><P>"Deamon"! said a
man "Go back to Hell where you came from"! "Yeah"!
repeted some men behind him then they started throwing pointy rocks
and stones at her she was on the verge of death when a tall raven
haired man steped in between only to stab her with a sharp speer
saying, "Die deamon" Then as she was dying she heard a
voice in her head.</p><P><I><B>"Do you wish to
live"?</B></I></p><P>Kirela was silent not
knowing what to say then the voice asked again.</p><P><I><B>"Do you wish to
live"?</B></I></p><P>"Yes". she said.
The men were cheering because as they looked over the non moving
coarpse they thought they finnaly got rid of the nuisance of The
Eight Tailed Neko</p><P>then all of the sudden the
coarpse rised of the ground being surrounded by a white looking
chakra Kirela's eyes were Amthest and she had sharp claws and teeth
she then lifted the rocks around her without using her hands and made
them form into a big rock and dropped it on the men and as blood flew
every where and some splashed on her face slowly she kept attacking
them hurting them making them suffer but after it was done she was
crying because she had never killed anyone before she swore she
wouldn't do it again so her fight with Naruto she blamed on Neko.</p><P>She was snapped out of her
memories by a hand shaking her shoulder and out of reflex punched the
owner of the hand.</p><P>"Ow ow ow Kirela that
hurt"! said Naruto now with a big round bump on his head.</p><P>"Sumemasen"!
said Kirela waving her hands in an 'I'm so so Sorry' gesture "I
didn't know you were there".</p><P>Naruto got up and dusted
himself off and smiled, "It's ok but I was wondering how about a
rematch"? he asked holding up the bell Kakashi had given him.</p><P>"Shure I'd like
that".</p><p align="center">OoOoOoO</p><P>Kakashi stood inside the
5th Hokage's office reading his new issue of Icha Icha paradise when
Shizune walked out of the office.</p><P>"You can come in
know" she said gestureing him inside.</p><P>Kakashi shut his book and
put it in his shurikan holster and walked in the door into the
office.</p><P>"Kakashi..."
Tsunade began "I need to tell you some things about Kirela".</p><P>Kakashi just nodded as
Tsunade continued.</p><P>"She has the Eight
Tailed Neko deamon inside her and her power is at Jonin level I put
her in your group not only because you have a open space but also
because I thought putting her with Naruto would teach her how to
trust people".</p><P>"I need to ask you
hows Sasuke's condition"? Kakashi asked worried about his other
teammate.</p><P>"He's out of Critical
condition but is still unconsious".</p><P>Kakashi said nothing and
only nodded. As he turned around to head out the door Tsunade called
to him.</p><P>"Tomorrow come to the
tower at 7:00 I have a mission for your team and by the way Akatsuki
is on the move so watch out for Naruto and Kirela I don't want
eiather to get hurt".</p><P>Kakashi walked out the
door heading tword the training grounds to tell his team about there
mission.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoO</p><P>Naruto and Kirela were
laying on the ground there backs against trees both were breathing
hard from the match they had just fought.</p><P>"Nice...job...your...really...good"said
Naruto between short breaths.</p><P>"Your...good...as...well"said
Kirela when a poof of smoke came to revel Kakashi.</p><P>"Yo". he said
startaling them both.</p><P>"K-Kakashi-sensie"
said Naruto still a little bit frightend "What do you need"?</p><P>"I just came to tell

Hidden enemies!!</p><p align="center">PART
1</p><P>It
was 7:00 and Kakashi sensie was no where in sight Naruto was falling
asleep, Sakura was talking to Kirela who was yawning and hardly
paying attention when the Lazy Ninja showed up he waited about 5
minutes before he hopped from the tree he was sitting in then
proceeded to speak.</p><P>"Yo"
he said camly starting to read his Icha Icha paridise book.</p><P>"What
do you mean 'Yo'"!! asked Sakura "Why are you two hours
late"!? she asked still yelling her words.</p><P>"Hey
Sakura-chan can you quiet down I'm trying to get some sleep here".
Said Naruto now yawning while speaking</p><P>"Get
up Naruto we have to complete our mission". said Kakashi. Naruto
was up and awake in three seconds he glanced over to Kirela who was
just looking at the fight sensie and student with a wierd look on her
face she turned and glanced at Naruto and immediately smiled at him
and waved.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoO</p><P>Team
seven had finally reached the hokage tower, It had taken them thirty
minutes just to make Sakura quit yelling at Kakashi for being late.
As they walked up the stairs to the Hokage's office they heard yellin
and waited out side the door.</p><P>"I
said No now get out" it was Tsunade yelling at someone</p><P>"But
you'ld be the perfect charecter"... a deep voice said most
likely coming from a man.</p><P>"OUT"!!
They heard Tsunade yell then out of no where the doors to the
Hokage's office opend and out flew a white haired man in red and gray
clothes.</p><P>"Pervy-sensie"!!
Naruto exclaimed jumping up and down at the sight of his other sensie
whom he had not seen for about eight months</p><P>"I
told you stop calling me that"!! Jiriya said trying to recover
from his hit to the wall. He looked at Naruto who had on his
signiture smile then at Kakashi who had started to red his book again
then he glanced at Sakura who had a look of confusion and worry on
her face then he noticed that Sasuke was not with the group but a
girl that looked no older than twelve maby thirteen standing next to
Naruto holding a Shuriken in her hands most likely for defence than a
threat.</p><P>"So"
Jiriya started looking at Kirela "Whats your name girl".</p><P>"Kirela"
Naruto shouted for her "She's taking Sasukes place until he's
out of the hospital". he said sadness now coloring his voice.</p><P>"Ah
Kakashi" came Tsunades voice where her head now stuck out of the
giant 'Jiriya shaped' hole in the Hokage's door. "I'm Ready to
see you know".</p><P>Kakashi
put up his book and decided to step in to the doors he opened up the
doors before walking in although he really ssaw no point but he
didn't fell like being telled at so he did. All of team seven was now
standing side by side hands straight down at there sides.</p><P>"As
you all now"... Tsunade began "This is a A rank mission and
could possibly become an S rank if it gets to dangerous and if it
dose we will send backup immediately". "You will be looking
for to Rouge Ninja by the names of Era and Zazu they are from the
land of mist they can be dangerous but should not be for this group".
She then handed a scroll to Kakshi that explained the mission more
thuroughly and percise then sh continued on "When you have found
and captured these two escort them to the lan of mist to Mr. Fujizaki
Lopiu he will then put the men into custody and you can come home".
"That is all you are dismised"!</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><P>Kirela was annoyed now
since they had left the gates of Kohona Naruto had been doing nothing
but saying how he was gonna prove to Sasuke that he was tougher than
him and more powerful. Kirela was also annoyed Because Sakura was
saying how she would prove that she's best for Sasuke and how Ino
wouldn't win. She was fed up if it wasn't for the hidden presence
sneeking up on them she would have yelled her brains out at the two.
She wanted no Hoped they would show there presence soon.</p><P>"Naruto, Sakura stay
on Guard someone is following us" Kakashi said now slowing down
and looking catiously around the forest they were nearing fire
country boarders and would soon be out of Kohona district. As they
hopped over the border they headed right twored the land of rock
thats where the the two Rouge Ninja had been seen Kakashi had notced
that the presence that was following them must had stopped following
them after they went over the boarder.</p><P><I>'Probably a rat or
squirrl' </I>thought Kakashi but in fact there
was someone following them.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><P>They had reached the land
of rock and were slowly passing through the villiage and tworad the
forest when they heard crashes comeing from a few streets away they
quickly ran over to see what the comotion was</p><P>Crash A big window at a
Pub(1) had been broken by a man being thrown through it. Behind the
man two men walked out of the broken window The first one was about
five foot eleven with brown spiky hair that had blonde streeks in it
he was wearing a black tucked in shirt with Kaki pants and a mist
hitiate(2) on his right arm he was also wearing some gogles and black
army boots his Shuriken holster was on his left leg and on his back
was a umbrella and a small goard for water . The second one was six
foot three and had Orange and Brown colored hair with Black streeks
he was also wearing gogles and a navy blue shirt that had the
Japanese symbol for 'Death' on it and he was also waring a Black
almost skin tight pants with a shuriken holter on his right leg and
his mist village hitiate on his left arm and three large tan, green,
and red scrolls on his back he was also werering army green army
boots. Kakashi looked at the wanted poster of Era and Zazu and
immediately he told his team and thay were ready to attack.</p><P>Naruto rushed at the men
and quikly and almost suddenly slashed Zazu whom was the second one
to come out of the Pub after his younger brother Era.</p><P>Zazu immediately turned
his attention to Naruto who quickly jumkped back to where his
teammates were.</p><P>"Look Brother"
said Zazu "Looks like we have Kohona Ninja on our tail". he
chukled a deep laugh</p><P>"Will we get to Kill
them Brother"? asked Era looking like he had a bllod lust.</p><P>"Naruto, Kirela you
go for Zazu, Me and Sakura will slow dom Era!</p><P>Naruto and Kirela rushed
tworad Zazu at there normal speed they each took a glance at one
another and immediately knew what to do.</p><P>"Earth Style Rock
barrier"! Kirela yelled planing to trap him so that Naruto could
attack him.</p><P>"Sadow clone jutsu"!
Naruto yelled as fifteen Naruto's appeared at onceand they started
attacking Zazu was tierd from running all night and half a day he was
hardly a match at the moment for them</p><P>Zazu took his first scroll
of his back did some hand signs and called out "Ninja art Double
Fire water jutsu"! He then spit out water and fire at the two
and didn't let up at all when he stoped Kirela's jutsu had got him
and he was now surronded by a dome of rock</p><P>"Damn it" Zazu

Era would nevre let him hear the end of it.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><P>Kakashi
and Sakura had chased Era to the edge of the begining of the forest
when he stopped and wouldn't go on without Zazu. He then reached for
his umbrella and small water goard and poared a little water on his
umbrella and held it up with one hand and did hand signs with the
other.</p><P>"Water
needle jutsu"! his umbrella began to rise and needles fell from
the sky and started falling all over the ground.</p><P>Kakashi
made some hand signs and immediately yelled out "Earth style
rock dome no jutsu"! he had copied Kirels technech during her
fight with Naruto the rock came up and formed a barrier around Him
and Sakura after the needles stoped falling Sakura broke through the
rock and slammed her fist in to the face of a surprised Era. He was
knoked out.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><P>Naruto and Kirela had

extravaganza: Rouge ninja</p><p align="center">and
Hidden enemies!!</p><p align="center">PART 2</p><P>Saying that Naruto was
anfry was an understate ment he had been attaked from behinde and was
now being held agaist his will by chains in a cell many miles away
from his team mates.</p><P><B>"Kit.."</B>
Kyubbi said.</p><P><I><U>"..."</U></I>
no answer Naruto blamed himsef for what was happening if only he
could have protected Kirela.</p><P><I><U><B>FLASHBACK START</B></U></I></p><P><I>The two men they had
encontered were rouge shinobi just like Zazu and Era They both had
messy brown hair and hazel eyes they were obiously twins.</I></p><P><I>"There"! one
of the men said pointing at Kirela. "Thats the one". the
man said now look at the other man and still pointing to Kirela.</I></p><P><I>"W-who a-are you"
Kirela stuttered they look vaugly familiar but she couldn't put her
finger on it they sent chills up her spine like the chills she got
when she was furosisly scarred of somthing or someone.</I></p><P><I>"Why you don't
remember"? asked one of the men who were both now stepping out
into the light. Now showing off thier fetures more than before you
could see that the one on the right was a red head did not have a
brown hair color like the one on the left.</I></p><P><I>"I'm Kumo"
said the red head.</I></p><P><I>"I'm Truyreo".
(True-re-o) said the brown head.</I></p><P><I>Kirela froze she
remembered them now it was all flooding back to her the sad and
friteful memories from long ago. When she was five three men had come
after her so they could give her to there master as the ultimate
birthday present. She had barely escaped and killed the one of the
men and lifethretenly injuring the other two after that she had run
to Iwagakure the wind village where she hid and lived a normal life
until she was ten when she left her foster family and went to the
leaf only to graduate a year early than the rest of her class were by
the time the whole class all graduated she was forgotten when they
made teams invetibly making her wait until an opening or new team.
Through all those years she had forgotten the three hoping, wishing,
beliveing they were dead.</I></p><P><I>Naruto noticed that
Kirela was frozen with either flooding memories or fear he reconised
it because he had frozen many times for the same reasons.</I></p><P><I>"Kirela we have to
fight them </I>together<I> as
a</I> team<I>"!</I></p><P><I>That snapped her from
her thoughts she was ready they were gonna win!</I></p><P><I><U><B>END FLASHBACK</B></U></I></p><P>They had lost... by alot.
Now he Kakashi and Sakura had been locked away and Naruto had lost
all hope it was his fault and now because of him Kirela was shurly on
her way to death.</p><P>"Naruto dont beat
yourself up we all are partily to blame" said Sakura she was in
the cell across from Naruto and Kakashi was in a cell next to him.</p><P>"She's right Naruto"
Kakashi said he had already made a plan and the Kakashi that was now
in the cage was clone. The sewer lid in front of the cells started
rattiling and Naruto pictured a big poisenous snake much like
Orochimarus had ben sent to kill them the lid flew off and out poped
Kakashi.</p><P>"Yo". He said.</p><P>"Kakashi-sensie".
Sakura beamed</p><P>"Kakashi-sensie"?
Naruto asked and as if on cue the clone Kakashi dispersed with a
'poof' and Kakashi opened the cages with the key he had stolen from a
recently knoked out guard.</p><P><B>"See Kit I told
you you would get out"! </B>belowed Kyuubi
laughing now at Naruto's expression. Naruto was realesed from his
chains when he was he started running he had memorized how they got
to the cell and were they took the unconsious Kirela he had a limeted
amount of time. He would save Kirela or die trying!</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoO</p><p align="center">Kirelas POV
(point of view)</p><P>'It's dark' she thought.</p><P><I><B>"Of corase its
dark your unconcious"</B></I></p><P>'I am'? I asked clearly I
was being sarcastic.</p><P><I><B>"You were</B></I><I><B>captured".</B></I></p><P>'No duh' I said I knew
that. 'Ojo' I asked I usually called him by this he wasn't very happy
when I called him The Eight Tailed Neko, When I did he growled at me
and told me it wasn't his name.</p><P>"<I><B>What"</B></I>
he asked he had a small bit of concern in his voice.</p><P>'where are they taking me?
Where is Naruto and the others'? I asked I was a bit more conserned
for my team than myself exactly how a shinobi should be. He opened
his mouth to speak but a bright light engulfed me and I was back in
the world of the living. I kept my eyes closed and kept my breathing
stable so they wouldn't see that I was awake I could hear them
talking I decided to listen I had nothing else to do.</p><P>"What do you think
master will give us for bringing her". The one holding me asked
it was Truyreo.</p><P>"Probly nothing she's
like a pizza thats thirty minutes late and you don't pay for".
he said I didn't like that one not at all comparing me to <I>cold</I>
pizza thats worth nothing that just wasn't right! They kept carrying
me to who nows where and who! They had stopped talkin so I was bored
but I couldn't complain I had to pretend to be uncincious still or
they most likely would <I>make</I>
me unconcious and I already had a headache I didn't want a bigger
one. We walked into a small room dimly lit by a few candles that
looked like they could go out at any moment if they hadn't been being
held up by a small amount of chakra most likly coming from one big
source. They threw me down my hands and feet were bound and my mouth
had tape over it. Have you ever tasted duck tape? It's not pleasent
Trust me I know! I now opened my eyes anouth to see a man sitting in
a chair like throne thingy he had one visible eye his bangs covered
the rest.</p><P>"Good" the man
said he was freaky but not in that 'I'm scarred' kind of Freaky it
was a more 'look at him and barf up lunch <I>and</I>
breakfast' kind of freaky he looked like a Toad for Kami's sake!
Truyreo lifted me up by my now ruffled red hair in the dark it could
be mistaken for black. He threw me at the feet of the Toad guy who
picked me up and looked me straight up and down. I didn't like his
stare it was lust filled and had the 'I'm gonna kill you slow and
painlessly' kind of look as well. He was staring at me his stare was
praticly burning my skull.</p><P>"So..." he began
I just stared at him with great discust. "You have two choices
join me or die". It was simple The bad ugly dudes ALWAYS said
the same thing. Well either that or promise you somthing they can not
give.</p><P>"And what if she
refuses and comes with us"? That voice I turned my head to look
to see who it was it was Naruto he was ok and he was with Sakura and
Kakashi-sensie they were ok I was crying now. I didn't know why it
was mixed emotions but the emotions that stood out the most was the
happiness I felt from seeing Naruto unharmed and the fact that I was
scared out of my mind anouth to show it.</p><P>"NARUTO" I
yelled I was still crying but I didn't care the man immediately
released me and cluthed his hand.</p><P>"You brat"! he
said looking at Naruto who's shoulder was now my crying place.</p><P>Naruto cmforting me
suddenly had a wierd chakra engulf him "You'll Pay you bastard
YOU'LL PAY FOR HURTING KIRELA"!!!!</p><P>'Ojo' I asked the eight
taled feline 'What is that'</p><P><I><B>"Kyuubi's
chakra".</B></I></p><P>'Who'? I asked.</p><P><I><B>"Naruto is the

6</p><p align="center">The
End has come??</p><P>Naruto's
chakra roared as he glared at the still sitting man his mind was gone
and all he wanted was to kill the man that had hurt his friend he
didn't know why he had wished to protect her, this forener who just
'barged in the front door'. Yet he did know she was a comrad a friend
a teammate <I>his</I>
teammate.</p><P>As
the nine-tailes's power absorbed him he was starting to lose himself
and only focaseing on the pain he would cause this man who had hurt
Kirela he was deffinately going to pay and pay dearly he would.</p><P>Naruto
lunged forward charging at the man on his chair, But he stoped as he
noticed the toad looking man snap his fingers and about two dozen
shinobi strong ones at that appeared surrounding Naruto ready to kill
or torture him on there masters command but before they could even
hope for a command Naruto started attacking them one by one they fell
blood splatering on the floor and wall as coarpse's started to fall
before the evily grinning Naruto's feet.</p><P>Kirela's
tears had ceased and new ones were now forming ones of fear and pain
as the blood spilled and the shinobi's body's fell lifelessly she
could only see flash backs of her own childhood blaze across her know
dancing emotionful eyes. She tared herself from the inflicting
memories and quickly use most of her chakra to put up a barrier
strong anough to even block a barrage of diffrent strong ubstoppable
jutsu that most likely only a hokage knew how to use. She stood tall
as tears flowed freely as she watched the battle progress.</p><P>The
toad man stood in awe of this boy he would make a profit fit for a
king, queen, prince, <I>and
</I>princess.
He stood up and laughed it was a harty laugh that just screamed "You
should join me boy" and very little else Naruto glared hard at
the man his large fangs barred. The man stoped his laughter and
smirked.</p><P>"I'll
take that as no then". He said his smile turning into a frown.
"Then this will be your grave"! He smirked thinking the
foxlike child would reconsider but instead Naruto thought of his
words as a personal challange and charged tworads the him. The man
noticed the oncoming boy and started doing hand sighns.</p><P>"Fire
Style Fire ball jutsu"! the man yelled as three large fireballs
blew from his mouth and tworads Naruto. Naruto didn't doge all three
hit him head on but the chakra had canceled out the jutsu.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoO</p><p align="center">With
Kakashi and Sakura</p><P>'<I>Damn
it'</I>
cursed Kakashi him and Sakura had been seperated from Naruto and
Kirela and to top it all off they had to fight Kumo
and Truyreo the man in the throne rooms top men they were both
already Jonin level sepret but together they could be Anbu and Hunter
ninja combined. In other words they were strong.</p><P>"Summoning Jutsu
Hunting dogs". Kakashi said slamming his palm on the ground. All
his hunter dogs puffed up in a cloud of smoke. He ordered them to
attack while he decided
to go help Naruto and Kirela Sakura could handle herself she probly
couldn't win in a fight aganst the strong opponents but she could
protect herself until He got back as he ran down some corradors he
ran into three of Truyreo's mud rock clones. He growled at this it
just wasted his time. As he doged the oncoming attacks from the
clones he finished off a set of hand signs creating five simple
shadow clones with kunai. They took out the mud rock clones esally
anoth now he was running down hallways and corradors.</p><P>He
came to the door only to stop and stare shocked and wide eyed at the
scene infront of him on the far right of the room he saw a smirking
toad looking man snikering to himself. Then on the floor on the left
side of the room about three yards away from the wall was a shaking
Naruto covered in frash crimson blood staring wide and horrid eyed at
the center of the floor where Kirela layed in the middle of the floor
shield gone with a sharp stone spike through her chest and stomache.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoO</p><p align="center">Kirela's POV</p><P>I was scared, I had many
emotions clouding my train of thought Naruto had jut deflected three
large fireballs. when they hit him I cried harder thinking he might
be badly burned he wasn't, I was so releved that he was ok. I had
stopped crying and was know watching the fight with intrest. Naruto
rushed twoard the man as he formed what looked like a rasengan but it
was red chakra instead of the usual blue tinted chakra.</p><P>He ran twoard the man on
the far right of the room but he was so blind with rage that he
didn't notice the fast moving hand signs that the man infront of him
was doing. I watched as he kept going at a dteady speed.</p><P>"NARUTO"! I
yelled hoping he would hear me and notice why I was so uneasy but he
just kept going I Undid my shield and rushed twoard Naruto. The man
had finished his hand signs and smirked. Naruto stoped when he
noticed the smirk he looked at the floor under him as he heard a
rumble imiting from it. I started running tworad him the floor was
now cracking and the man was now snikering.</p><P>"NARUTO MOVE"! I
yelled again. He didn't move I rushed forward my feet wouldn't stop
the ground craked larger as miniture spikes shot out of the ground.</p><P>"NARUTO"! I
yelled as a pushed him away from me as the spikes flew up and stabbed
me. The last thing I saw before I fell further on the spikes stiking
painfully out of my chest and stomache was Kakashi-sensei's gaping
face and sakura's scream of my name then it was black.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoO</p><p align="center">Normal POV</p><P>"KIRELA"!!
Sakura yelled when she saw the seen she was currently trying to
belive was genjutsu. The man was still laughing at the bloody seen he
had made.</p><P>"Whats your name"?
Kakashi asked from the doorway staring down the man who had just
speared Kirela with spikes.</p><P>"Sorukon" he
said.</p><P>"Well Sorukon I hope
you like a Chidori through your chest". Kakashi said calmly as
he ran twoard Sorukon with a very powerfu chidori. He charged at the
man and hit him head on as a direct hit to his heart he coughed blood
spilling it onto Kakashi's hand.</p><P>"At least 'cough
cough' I Killed one of the deamons". As he finished his sentence
he fell dead on the ground.</p><P>Sakura rushed over to
Naruto's still shaking form. As she neeared him she noticed that the
features he had goten earlier were now gone.</p><P>"Naruto it's over we
can go back to village and have Kirela healed". She said.</p><P>"Naruto" called
Kakashi now with a bloody Kirela over his shoulder. "If we can
make it back to Konoha by Night fall we should be able to heal Kirela
before she loses to much blood". Naruto nodded but no other
answer was given.</p><P>I'm working on three

clouds and Recovery</p><p align="center">Part 1</p><P>Kisame groaned as he and
Itachi were walking onece again away from there infamos organization.
They had just been told that the eight tailed Neko, Ojo had been
found and that it was in the same place as the Nine tailed Fox,
Kyuubi. To Leader this was horable it meant more work. To Kisame it
meant more fun. The reason he was groaning was that he had to share
this with Deidara and Sasori.</p><P>"Were going to leaf
right, Un" Deidara asked</p><P>"Hn" was his
reply from Itachi and Sasori.</p><P>Yep this was defenetely
not his day but getting two deamons at once would be worth it.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><p align="center">With Naruto</p><P>Naruto, Kakashi, and
Sakura had gotten to the Kohona hospital in enough time to have
Kirela treated enough to releve everyones worries except for
Naruto's. Naruto was confronted by Tsunade with good news saying that
she would be up and moving again soon. Naruto wasn't very shure she
had said the same about Sasuke and yet he hadn't woken up at all yet.
He sighed as he walked into Kirela's room and sat by the Cot deciding
to talk to the unconcious girl while he was there.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><p align="center">Kirela's POV</p><P>Again it's dark and I
cannot see where I am and yet it is so familier. I walk down what
seems like hallways and corridors searching for some kind of light. I
havn't hit anything yet so I think I'm fine. I go through my thoughts
remembering what had happened. I had seen amazing strength from
Naruto that reminded me of Ojo's power yet it was stronger and more
fierce and frightening.</p><P>I'm worried if he is ok I
hope I stopped the Spikes from hitting him. I can't remember much
after I pushed him away from the area, and yet I feel like there was
more after that. I can see light now it has a slight purple tint to
it. I'm pretty shure I know where I am now. I'm in my head trapped
from the Light engulfed in Darkness now I know I must have saved
Naruto.</p><P>"Ojo" I called
into the wide space.</p><P><I><B>"What do you
want"</B></I> he asked as I could hear a
grumble immiting from the Dark.</p><P>"What has happened
why is it so Dark"? I asked It was never this dark in my head
ever.</p><P><I><B>"You were
dying".</B></I> he said I stood still then
starred up at the darkness.</p><P>"I Know That I had a
spike through my Chest"!! I yelled he always skipped the point
and took things way to seriously. I think he dose it just to make me
mad.</p><P><I><B>"Your in
recovery you are </B></I><B>'Lucky'</B><I><B>
to be OK".</B></I> I didn't say much I let
him Talk I mean after all he was an all powerful deamon.<I><B>"The
Blonde boy is the Kyuubi vesel that is why he has such immense power
compared to Ours.</B></I> I took this slowly in
as this meant that Naruto was... like me. I had a couple more
questions to ask but as I raised my my head to speak A Very Bright
White Light engulfed me fully.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><p align="center">Normal POV</p><P>Naruto stopped talking as
he heard a grone from Kirela his eyes shooting open as he ran to the
door and asked a nearby Nurse to get Tsunade. He then ran back to the
side of the bed awaiting Kirela to Open her eyes and Speak to him
after what was such a long time to him.</p><P>"N-naruto Where am
I"? She asked sounding so weak.</p><P>"Kirela your ok"!!
Came the voice of Sakura as she entered the room along with Tsunade.
Tsunade walked over to the side of the bed and Cheaked Kirela's
tempeture as well as her Pulse.</p><P>"I see you finnaly
woke up". She said as she went through all of the
precausionarys. "You were out for three days". She said
smiling. Kirela was shoked, in her head it only seemed as if she was
out for only a few hours. She must have spent alot of time walking
around trying to figure out where she was. Apperintly the shock
showed on her face because Naruto smiled at her reashuringly.</p><P>"Hey It's ok I was
nocked out for a week once". He said patting Kirela's shoulder.</p><P>"Ow don't touch"
Kirela said as she hissed at the sudden pain. Naruto backed up and
smiled warilly.</p><P>"Sorry". He said
rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly. Tsunade walked to the door
followed by Sakura when she called back.</p><P>"Naruto let her be
she needs rest". She said calling the boy out. Naruto left with
a wave goodbye and quickly left the room leaveing her by herself She
was happy that Naruto was ok. She then quickly dozed off to sleep,
she still had more questions to ask Ojo and she also needed the rest
she had never felt this Tierd before.</p><p align="center">OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</p><p align="center">With Akatsuki</p><P>"Sasori-danna are we
there yet, un"? Deidara asked as he sat down on a log. "I
don't want to walk anymore can we rest for Lunch, Un"? He asked
desprite for a break. He had always hated running thats why he always
flew on the back of his clay birds.</p><P>"Now that I think
about it I am hungry how about it Itachi-san wanna stop for an hour
or two"? Kisame asked looking at Deidara. Itachi said nothing
just nodded then walked away most likely looking for some food or
water.</p><P>Kisame gathered rocks and
sticks for a fire, while Diedarra played with his clay making bombs
he could use for later. Sasori just sat and watched the two do thier
thing as he quietly went on fixing his puppets and making them more
durrable. Soon Itachi came back with some dead Rabbit do to the fact
that Kisame wouldn't eat fish for his Life. He put the dead rabbit on
the flame and watched it cook while they waited. Soon thier lunch was
consumed and they were back on the road again twoard thier Targets.
Who were now only five more days away from them.</p><P>Itachi's
thoughts trailed to after the Chuunin exams when he had first
confrunted the Kyuubi vessel. His foolish little brother had
interrupted them back then as well as the Sanin Jiraiya.
To his knowledge his brother had been knoked out by Naruto when he
planned to Go to Orochimaru for power but failed. The Sanin was also
away on what was called<I>
research</I>
so this time he wouldn't get in the way either. In Itachi's eyes this
couldn't be better but just in case they had to Make shure no one in
the village knew they were coming because it they did it would cause
unwanted trouble for them all.</p><P>They
kept going at an even pace slowly gaining iformation on how A man and
his men were found in some ruins dead. Itachi had made his team check
it out and almost immediately did they detect sighns of Ojo The eight
Tailed Neko and Kyuubi the Nine Tailed Fox they were suprised to find
the two sighns so close maby they were after each other. They had
apparently been fighting the dead man as a mission so that ruled out
hunting one another. They also noticed that the Eight Tailed deamon
vessels blood was scattered about the center of the room. This
Illistrated that the Deamon vessel was wounded making Itachi and the
other's job Much much easier. This had just gotten so much better In
thier eyes.</p><P>Itachi
smirked at the Idea of the deamon vessels having maby a chance of
getting away from the four infamous Akatsuki members. Lucky for
Itachi it was only his imagination. He knew that this time he would
have both the Kyuubi and the Neko in record time. To bad for them
they were thier targets.</p><P><B>DONE

clouds and Recovery part 2</P><P>Kirela
looked up at the ceiling she was restless she couldn't just lie there
in the hospital forever she'd go mad. After discussing with her self
the Pros and Cons of staying or going she chose to leave. Kirela
stood up grabed her belongings and started walking to the door half
way there an alarm went of and nurses rushed inside and tied her down
with roaps as Tsunade and Shizune came in.</P><P>"Don't
try and escape when you aren't at full health Kirela". Said
Tsunade taunting the girl. Kirela was silent and ignored the Sanin.
Tsunade was about to go on with anouther big speech as Naruto entered
the room still as happy as ever.</P><P>"Naruto"!
cried Kirela after seeing him come in. She tried to get up but the
ropes held her down "UGHH NOT FAIR".</P><P>Tsunade
looked at Kirela then at Naruto and made her ninja untie her at this
Kirela was startaled.</P><P>"Why'd
you let me go"?</P><P>"You
need a break so go off and have fun". Tsunade said leaving the
room at this Ojo had some words to spare.</P><P><I><B>"Some
time alone huh It's like thier dating". </B></I>Kirela
blushed at that. She slowly stood up and Naruto walked her out
twoards the streets of Kohona.</P><p align='center'>OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</P><P>When
they reached Iciraku's Ramen Bar they began filling their stomaches
with food. While eating Kirela looked Naruto over thinking to herself
how he could change someway.</P><P>"Naruto",
Kirela said as Naruto put down his bowl and smiled.</P><P>"Huh
what Kirela-chan"? He asked looking dumbfounded.</P><P>"..."</P><P>"What"?
asked Naruto not catching what she said.</P><P>"You
need new clothes". She repeted while Naruto began to pout and
looked over his clothes.</P><P>"Whats
wrong with my clothes"? He asked slightly whineing.</P><P>"Naruto
they practically scream 'KILL ME'" she said making him frown.</P><P>"They
do no such thing"!! he yelled hugging himself as if he wanted to
protect the 'jumpsuit of death' as Kirela now adressed it. Kirela
gave up there and watched as Naruto payed the bill and stood up. The
boy streached and yawned then and idea struck him and without warning
he grabbed her and dragged her down the street at a fast pace.</P><p align='center'>OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</P><p align='center'>With
Akatsuki</P><P>Kisame
just knew it he knew it. It had just been proven to him. It had been
proven that he was the only sane member of Akatsuki left. Even Sasori
the Ninja of the sand that killed the Kazakage was gone. How did he
know this you might ask easy. While walking through Kohona Itachi had
stopped in the middle of the street and stole his wallet just so he
could by twenty limited addition Cherry Cola Dangos!! Deidara had run
in circles begging for icecream money and then when he got some
skipped over to the icecream man and bought a five scoup Icecream
cone!</P><P>Sasori
had topped it all of by walking into a carpenters store just to buy
some rare wood. But the thing that made him crazy was after he came
out of the store he was calling it 'Precious' and roking back and
forth with it in his arms.</P><P>Thats
what proved To Kisame was the ONLY non-insane person in Akatsuki maby
the only non-insane person in the world!!</P><P>"Itachi
can we please just get the mission done"!? Cried Kisame as they
had been sitting with their bought items eating and/or protecting
them.</P><P>"Kisame".
called Itachi looking the Shark man in the eyes. "I always get
the job done or close to done always". He said pausing Kisame
knew where this was going the whole 'I will run a thousand mile for
dangos" story.</P><P>"If
I can run more than a thousand miles a week for my Dangos you can
wait a hundred minutes while I eat them". He said popping
anouther of the now only 3 dangos in his mouth. Kisame slammed his
head down on the table, and as anime tears started rolling down his
face he thought.</P><P>'Why
didn't I take the offer to be a rare Pokemon and be captured by the
wierdo with black hair? Oh thats right I HAD TO BE AN AKATSUKI
MEMBER'!! He slammed his head on the table repetedly as the three
finished what they were doing weather it be eating or putting
gigantic planks of wood away. As the four sat ready to search again
two figures ran past them. Naruto and Kirela. The four jumped up and
started after them.</P><p align='center'>With
Naruto</P><P>Naruto
zoomed down different allyways and diffrent rooftops not stopping he
wouldn't answer Kirela when she asked him where they were going he'd
just say 'You'll See' and went on his way.</P><P>"Naruto
tell me where we're going It's getting dark". The blonde boy
said nothing and continued running Kirela was starting to get angry
as they reached an empty area she pulled her hand from his and said.
"If you don't tell me where we're going I won't follow you"!!
She yelled as he smirked.</P><P>"We're
here". he said pointing to his right and to her amazement there
in all it's painted glory was the bright sunset and the The full
moon.</P><P>"Wow".
she said forgeting the fued and sitting down as she sat though a loud
rumble was heard and The ground craked as water flew up from under it
and two hands pulled Kirela down into it.</P><P>"Kirela"!!
Naruto yelled grabbing her hands and pulling her up he relized how
ever that she was being pulled under. So he sent a spike of Chakra
through Kirela harming her and shoking her but also shocking her
holder anouth for them to let go. After this he pulled her up for air
wich she took gratefully.</P><P>"What
was That"!! She asked able to speak again.</P><P>"I
don't know but we're deffenately not alone anymore". he said as
fog entered the area and four figures emerged from it.</P><P>"Hello
Naruto-kun long time no see" Said a deep voice that Frightened
the both of them.</P><P>"Itachi"!!
Naruto spat with hatred as the figure showed himself completely.</P><P>"Thats
no way to talk to a superior".called Sasori to the right of
Itachi.</P><P>"WHO
THE HELL ARE YOU" Yelled Kirela at the red head ninja.</P><P>"I
am Sasori of the Red sand and you are the Eight Tailed Neko's vessel"
At this Kirela was shocked how could they know Ojo?? Hardly anyone
knew he was even still alive! So how could of they know it was inside
of her!</P><P>"I
have been ordered to take you back and extract that deamon of
yours... maby if your a good fighter I'll put your body to good use
and use you as my Puppet".</P><P>"Now
come or we'll force you"Said Itachi a smirk on his lips and his
sharingan activated he knew this battle would get him the Neko even
if he couldn't get the Nine Tails he would get the girl if it killed
him This was his goal. And so it began.</P><p align='center'>OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOo</P><P><U><B>END
