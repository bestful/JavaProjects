first fanfic, so be gentle with the reviews. This begins at the
night of the gennin exams. It then diverges slightly from the story
but keeps all the important events present. Oh, and bold has to do
with Kyuubi or author's notes.</B></p><P>------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>'This is going to be
so great.' This was the thought that was going through Naruto's
head over and over as he stood in the clearing that Mizuki told him
about.</p><P>Naruto was in his
normal garb. That really gaudy, tacky orange jumpsuit that no person
with even a single brain cell would be caught dead in. Naruto simply
loved the thing.</p><P>Naruto looked around
the clearing. It was secluded with dense trees on every side. There
was absolutely no trail leading to it and the only way to find it
seemed to be if you were specifically looking for it. It was small
enough to not draw attention and large enough to practice most
jutsus. This was the perfect training spot. He'd have to thank
Mizuki for telling him about it. He then took the scroll off of his
back.</p><P>'Man this is one big
scroll' he thought. It must have been the size of a log. Hmm, log,
for some reason that comparison seemed important. "Oh well, better
get to learning this jutsu so I can pas the exam," he said out load
just to fill the clearing with some sound. The clearing seemed to be
eerily quiet. 'Hmm, that seems foreboding. Whatever.'</p><P>He then opened up the
scroll to take a look at the first jutsu. "KAGE BUSHIN! This is
showing up everywhere. Well let's get to it. But first," Naruto
grinned mischievously and looked a little bit further ahead, "Why
just look at the one when I can check out the next few. First is the
Rasengen. Let's see what this is."</p><P>The scroll read "<I>The
Rasengen is a powerful jutsu that will rip the opponent apart from
the inside if used correctly." </I>at this Naruto let out a whistle<I>
"Its drawback is it requires a lot of chakra control and con only
be used in close combat. No hand seals are required. Its mastery is
done in three stages..." </I>Naruto quickly read the rest. After
finding that it required multiple items to learn (specifically
balloons and rubber balls) he decided to put that off until he could
buy those.</p><P>He then looked at the
next jutsu, "<I>The Body Flicker. The Body Flicker is a jutsu that
is easy to use but very difficult to master. The basics are creating
a Kage Bushin and then using the Kawarimi jutsu to replace yourself
with it, then dispel the clone. A true master of the technique can
use the jutsu without any seals, sounds, or smoke and even manage to
make the clone appear in any position and dispel it as you replace
yourself, hence making it seem like he just disappeared and
reappeared in a random pose."</I></p><P>"That could
be useful, but it seems like these jutsus either require either items
or mastery of earlier skills. I should just learn the Kage Bushin.'
 And so Naruto started to practice the Kage Bushin. And practice. 
And practice.</p><P>/------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>"KAGE BUSHIN NO
JUTSU!" Naruto yelled with all his might forcing as much chakra
as he could into his jutsu. 17 clones popped into existence. He
looked back at the scroll, '<I>Someone with a mastery of this jutsu
can make 20 clones at any given time.'</I> 'Damn, not enough'Naruto thought to himself. He was sweating and panting hard. It
was at that time he decided to take a break, he had gotten close
enough. He sat for long enough to catch his breath and stop sweating
bullets.</p><P>That was when he saw
Iruka-sensei enter the clearing. "I found you Iruka-sensei!"</p><P>"No you idiot I
found you!" Iruka yelled. He was pissed; he had just spent his
night running through the forest looking for that stupid kid. What
the hell would possess that kid to take the forbidden scroll that the
fourth had written all his jutsus in (including the one he would
later use to seal the Kyuubi) and bring it into this secluded part of
the forest?</p><P>"Why did you take
that scroll?" Iruka asked, confusion dripping from his every word.</p><P>"Oh, Mizuki told me
that if I could learn a jutsu from this scroll, you'd have to pass
me. And guess what, I DID!" After this comment two thoughts went
through his head. His first thought was 'Why would Mizuki tell him
that?' Before his brain could process the answer to that a second
thought came to his mind. 'How the could he learn one of those
jutsus, they were all at least A ranked jutsus, and some were even S
ranked!'</p><P>As he was
contemplating the second thought the answer to the first became
blatantly obvious as he sensed a malevolent, but familiar chakra. It
was Mizuki. It clicked. He was after the scroll. He had just used
Naruto to get to it. He was going to go further than the villagers;
he was going to kill Naruto. He would not let this happen. He would
protect Naruto with his life.</p><P>/------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>"You should not have
gotten involved Iruka! I was going to kill the brat first but you
have been just too much of a nuisance. Prepare to die." Naruto
heard this statement from where he was standing. His whole life had
just been put in the blender. He was the Kyuubi. He was the Kyuubi
and because of that no one loved him. He had felt like dirt and was
angry as hell. That was until he heard what Iruka said. Iruka
respected him and acknowledged him. He was the only one in the world
that cared for him, and now Mizuki was going to kill that one person.</p><P>All of a sudden some
thing inside of him snapped. He was angry, angrier than he had ever
felt before, even with the villager's taunts. He felt power he
never new he had coming to the surface. <B>(A/N: this is his power,
not the Kyuubi's) </B>He was going to save Iruka. He jumped from
his hiding spot and kneed Mizuki right in the chest sending him
flying across the forest. He landed about 20 feet away from Naruto.</p><P><B>"</B>Don't
touch Iruka sensei or I'll kill you." Naruto said with a voice
that gave off the impression that not only did he completely mean
what he just said, but also that he was more than capable. The
killing intent he was giving off made Iruka flinch, but Mizuki was
too enraged to notice it.</p><P>"Shut up you little
punk, I'll kill you in one shot!" Mizuki shouted at the child. 
He was enraged that this little idiot would dare to think that he
could lay a hand on him. It was insolent; he would put this child in
his place.</p><P>"Try it trash, I'll
return the pain a thousand times." Naruto said in an almost calm
voice. It was so confident that it was kind of disturbing.</p><P>"KAGE BUSHIN NO
JUTSU!" Naruto yelled. He needed to use this correctly. He
pulled all the power he had from his body. Every last drop of chakra
was put into this jutsu. This was for every time he had ever been
mistreated. This was for every time any one had ever thought of him
as the dead last. But most of all this was for Iruka. He would
protect his precious person. Even if it cost him every last ounce of
his life.</p><P>/-----------------------------------------------------------------</p><P><B>Deep inside Naruto,
in the seal that contained the most powerful demon in the world, the
Kyuubi sat watching what Naruto was doing.</B></p><P><B>"Hmm the kid has
spunk, and potential, and stamina out his ass and then some. Not
many would be able to conjure that much chakra at will at his level. 
I wonder if I should let him take some of mine so he doesn't get
himself killed." As the Kyuubi was weighing the chooses she saw
what was going on outside her cage. 'Hmm, guess that won't be
necessary.'</B></p><P>/------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>A thousand clones
popped into existence as he did the seal. That would be more than
enough. The clones then took to pounding on Mizuki, taking out the
anger Naruto had keep pent up all his life under his mask of
happiness on the teacher.</p><P>After wards, Naruto
felt a lot better. That was when Iruka called him over. "Hey
Naruto, come here for a moment." Naruto obliged. "Close your
eyes." Naruto was wondering what was going on, but from the look
in Iruka's eyes, he could tell it was a good thing. So he closed
his eyes. "Now open them." Naruto opened his eyes to see Iruka's
bare forehead. He then realized what had happened</p><P>"Congratulations,
graduate."</p><P>/------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P><B>(A/N): Hope you
liked that, and yes, it will diverge move from the story line more
than what happened in that chapter. Oh, and I will try to keep
OOCness to a minimum. Please read and review.</B></p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>(A/N): Are those
flying pigs? Oh, back to this. Wow, this still exists? Just a word
of advise, if a mob of angry reviewers kill me, chapter three will
never be published, so uhâ€¦ PLEASE DON'T KILL ME! Oh and I fixed
the sex thing.</B></p><P>/------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>Naruto was slowly
heading towards the academy. Last night he had spent almost the
whole time practicing his jutsus until he almost passed out. He had
also spent a lot of money getting, in bulk, the items needed to use
the Rasengen. As he strolled along, he laughed a bit at the memory
of yesterday's incident with Konohamaru and the Harem No Jutsu. Ah,
good times.</p><P>Nara Shikamaru was
wearing his usual style. He had a short sleeve shirt worn over a
fishnet undershirt. He had his newly acquired headband worn over is
upper arm and had on a pair of jeans. His hair was in a very small
pony tail. Naruto walked into the class room with an aura of pride
around him. Shikamaru noticed this and was very confused. He had
remembered seeing Naruto fail the gennin exams. He had seen it with
his own eyes. He took this opportunity to question Naruto about
this. Sort of.</p><P>"Hey Naruto, this
class is for graduates only." This seemingly offhand comment
really pissed Naruto off. Every one thought of him as the dead last.
 No one seemed to think he could pass. He didn't know that
Shikamaru had seen him fail, so he was about ready to flip out, but
he decided against it, no reason to make a scene.</p><P>"Don't you see the
headband?" Shikamaru kept his whatever attitude. Naruto decided
to take a seat. It was at that moment that Sakura walked in. He had
a crush on her, she was truly beautiful. She was wearing a
traditional red Chinese dress with a pair black of shorts underneath
that showed through the sides of the dress.</p><P>She came his way and
stood right next to the seat he was sitting at. 'Wow, she really
wanted to sit next to me, this is like a dream come true.'</p><P>"Get the hell out of
the way Naruto! I want to sit next to Sasuke." Sakura told him. 
She really didn't like the dead last that much, he was just
annoying. Naruto was pissed, he looked to his left. There sat
Sasuke, all cool and detached, he was the school heartthrob. He wore
a blue t-shirt with the Uchiha fan on the back and a pair of cargo
shorts. He had his signature scowl that seemed permanently glued to
his face. All the girls loved that he was so angsty. He hated
Sasuke. 'Hmm, maybe I should try my new jutsu.</p><P>Naruto made 2 hand
seals inconspicuously under the table and did the Body Flicker. There
was a poof and he managed to make the clone dispel itself before it
could be seen. He appeared standing in front of Sasuke, but he was
facing the wrong way. 'Damn it.' He quickly turned and
immediately crouched down. His face was just a few inches from that
of the angsty scum bag. They were glaring at each other with pure
malice. That was when the worst possible thing happened.</p><P>The guy sitting
directly in front of them bumped into Naruto and knocked him into
Sasuke. Then their lips meet. It took them a second to figure out
what happened. When they did figure it out, they decided to try to
cough and spit and do various other things to clean their mouths.</p><P>'Something bad is
about to happen,' Naruto could feel it. He should have used body
flicker to leave. But he wanted to know what was behind him. He
looked. He regretted this course of action immediately. There stood
Sakura cracking her knuckles. Behind her was at least Â¾ of
the female part of the class. He was in deep shit.</p><P>3 minutes later when
Iruka got into the class, he saw Naruto sitting at his seat looking
like the shit had just gotten beat out of him. 'Oh well, time to
announce the teams.'</p><P>"Attention students,
it is time to name the teams." Naruto was kind of out of it so he
spaced out until he heard his name. "Team 7 Uzamaki Naruto, Haruno
Sakura..."</p><P>"Yeah!" Naruto
yelled. 'Now just anyone but Sasuke and I'll be fine'</p><P>"And Uchiha Sasuke."
 Now it was Sakura's turn to yell her excitement. She was happy
even if she was on the same team as Naruto.</p><P>"Please go wait for
your Jounnin sensei in the provided room."</p><P>/------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>"Man this sucks!"
raged Naruto. He was pissed off that his sensei was not there yet. 
He decided it would be good for his anger if he punched a wall, so he
did. As his fist connected, a small, almost unnoticeable amount of
chakra was released. It wasn't Naruto's. Naruto didn't know
this of course, but he was surprised at what happened anyways.</p><P>The sudden sound
roused the Uchiha from his angsty trip down memory lane. He looked
over his shoulder to the back of the small square room he was sitting
in. There he saw something he didn't think was possible. Naruto
had apparently blown a crater into the back wall of the room.</p><P>'WOW,' that was
the single thought that went through Naruto's head. He had been
angry, sure, but he had never done that before, nothing even close to
that. It clicked. 'I thought that the meditation might help a
little, but this is awesome. He was, of course, talking about the
meditation he had done that morning and the night before in
accordance with what the scroll had advised when learning the body
flicker. The same meditation that had started to put steps into
motion that wouldn't have happened for months other wise. The same
meditation that would eventually change his thoughts of the Kyuubi. 
Naruto was ignorant as usual.</p><P>He immediately took
the water balloon out of his pocket and tried to swirl chakra in it. 
He managed to get it to spin but without any distortion to the shape
of the balloon.</p><P>"Hey dobe, what's
with the stupid colored balloon?" Sasuke asked. And he actually
was curious. Naruto had just blown a crater into a wall and then
took a balloon out of his pocket and rested it on the palm of his
hand.</p><P>"Yeah Naruto, what
is that balloon for?" Sakura was also stunned. Naruto was the
dead last; he shouldn't be able to do that. Sasuke should, but not
Naruto. 'Whatever,' she thought, 'back to Sasuke watching.'</p><P>Sasuke was not going
to put it out of his mind that easily. 'I mean, <I>Naruto </I>blew
a <I>crater</I> in the wall. Sure, I could do it, but it wasn't
some thing a normal, just out of the academy gennin could do on a
whim.'</p><P>"Now really, how did
you do that?"</p><P>/------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>Kakashi was on the way
to meet his three students. Or, at least he would get there
eventually. Currently he was just lost in thought wandering in the
general direction of the academy. He was close (by his standards)
when he felt a sudden surge of chakra coming from said academy. He
mind went through a quick string of logic. Every one was probably
with their Jounnin instructors. All but his three students. Iruka
had left. That left three people. He decided to hurry up.</p><P>/------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>"I'm not going to
tell you." Naruto was happy. Scratch that Naruto was ecstatic. 
He had something to hold over Sasuke's head. Finally Sasuke knew
what it meant to fell inferior. Well, he didn't but Naruto thought
he did.</p><P>"I'm not going to
ask again."</p><P>"Thanks, then I
won't need to tell you."</p><P>THWACK. That is the
sound that would have been made if Sasuke's fist had hit Naruto. 
Which it would of if Naruto had not taken that exact time to stretch
his back. He had leaned his head back just enough to make it so that
Sasuke's swing came a hair's breath from hitting him. To the
three other people in the room it looked like he had just deftly
dodged the blow. Some people have all the luck.</p><P>Speaking of three
people, Kakashi had just entered the room. He had been about to step
in when Naruto dodged the punch. Now his jaw had taking the liberty
of hanging open. In fact, if his mask wasn't there, it would
probably have hit the floor like Sakura's currently was.</p><P>Sasuke had a little
more of a conserved reaction, but not by much. He had frozen.</p><P>'There's no way. 
Just no way."</p>
