This idea has been running through my head for a couple of weeks now so I hope you enjoy!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>On the forest floor, there was no room to move, let alone walk or run. Almost every inch was taken up by larger than normal tree roots, hidden fissures, mud holes, and thorns. Up in the treetops, it wasn't much better. The normal tree branches usually used by shinobi were covered by a sickly-colored moss that was slippery enough that even chakra to the feet wouldn't stick and allow for support. The next best choices of branches were layered with spikes that even the most untrained civilian could tell were poisonous. That only left the smaller, thinner branches in the very tops of the trees as stepping points. Even then, half of the branches were brittle enough that even the slightest pressure caused them to snap in half.</p><p>The Untraveable Forest was aptly named. Yet, still people tried to cross it. No one had succeeded in many years. Even the best shinobi went missing in this forest.</p><p>A teenage boy growled angrily as yet another branch snapped under his foot as he tried to land on it. He lost balance and felt himself falling but with a small burst of energy and chakra and he was back on track.</p><p>"Where are we going, Pervy-sage?" He called to the man up ahead, the one who was leading the way.</p><p>Both of the travelers looked and dressed very strangely for the area. The man in the lead was older, with long spiky white hair that looked more like a headdress than hair. He was bulkier and was wearing a grey shirt and pants. Underneath the shirt and pants was a set of mesh armor and over the entire outfit was a sleeveless red coat. It was the facial markings that stood out the most though. Two red lines streaked down his cheeks, starting right below his eyes and ending at his jaw.</p><p>The second was the boy. He stood out like an eyesore in the forest, wearing nothing but a bright orange jumpsuit. The color orange clashed horribly with the greens and browns of the forest. He stood out even more with his spiky orange-blonde hair, whisker-like scars on his cheeks, and bright blue eyes. He was easily spotted.</p><p>"You'll see." The white-haired man replied, calling back over his shoulder. "And don't call me that!"</p><p>The blonde rolled his eyes.</p><p>"Never tells me anything." The boy grumbled under his breath.</p><p>His comment was overheard but the older man decided not to comment back to his charge. It was best if the boy was left unaware. If he knew where they were going and what they were doing he would only be loud with his complaints. He would still be loud no matter what, as the boy had no understanding of the word 'subtle', but he wouldn't have anything specific to complain about.</p><p>If they hadn't been running late in the first place, Jiraiya would have never considered taking Uzumaki Naruto through the Untraveable Forest. However, it was very important that he complete this mission and to do so meant crossing the Untraveable Forest to do that on time.</p><p>The forest was finally beginning to thin out and Naruto sighed in relief as he noticed that it was getting easier to travel. Jiraiya, on the other hand, had a very bad feeling. They were nowhere near the edge of the forest, and from what he had heard the entire forest was dense and thick, from the start to finish. Why would it thin out in the middle, which was normally the thickest part of any forest?</p><p>"Naruto, stop!" Jiraiya called, just barely spotting the wires up ahead. They were so thin that even the most trained shinobi would have a hard time seeing them. The two travelers skidded to a stop and Jiraiya shivered as he spotted wire just centimeters away from his foot. They had nearly run straight into a trap.</p><p>"What's wrong?" Naruto questioned, not daring to move. He didn't see the traps but that was unsurprising.</p><p>"Traps." Jiraiya said shortly. "All over the place." Jiraiya examined the scene further. In front of him, for as far as he could see, there were traps all over the place, covering both the forest floor and the treetops. It was a very intricate layout. As far as Jiraiya could tell, there was no going forward.</p><p>Or to the sides, he concluded, spotting similar setups on either side. They would have to go back, losing valuable time.</p><p>"We have to head back." The sannin stated, looking grim. He turned and stopped in his tracks.</p><p>A woman was blocking their way. Her face was thin, with sharp angles, her eyes far apart, narrow and a cold black. A cruel smile was placed upon unusually thin lips. Her skin was pale with a sickly green tint to it and she looked to be about Naruto's age. Jiraiya's eyes narrowed. Were those scales tattooed onto her skin? Her hair was a deep brown, almost black and fell to her middle back. It was tied back in a way that Naruto recognized as similar to how Hyuuga Neji tied his hair. She was wearing a tight green jacket that closed with fang like buttons. She was also wearing a black skirt that had a slit in it that went all the way up to the belt portion, causing the skirt to fall to one side. The hems on both the jacket and the skirt had white borders. Gold bracelets decorated her wrists.</p><p>There was one word that could describe her overall appearance. Snake-like.</p><p>"Finally someone that looks like they'd be able to play." She said in a soft drawl.</p><p>"Who are you and what do you want?" Naruto demanded, coming to stand next to Jiraiya. He had kunai in his hands, ready to be used at a second's notice. The girl's smile turned into a smirk.</p><p>"What does it matter?" She asked in a coy manner. "It always ends the same way—me devouring your bodies."</p><p>Jiraiya was disgusted. This girl reminded him of a younger, female version of Orochimaru. The world only needed one.</p><p>"Naruto…"Jiraiya murmured softly. Naruto straightened up and nodded.</p><p>"Shadow Clone Jutsu." The blonde made the appropriate hand signs and every spot possible was soon taken over by a shadow clone. The snake girl didn't even blink, causing Naruto to growl. She raised her hands in the air, as if she was preparing to summon something. Jiraiya tensed.</p><p>"Come!" She called. "Come and kill!"</p><p>What Jiraiya and Naruto originally passed off as vines on the tree trunks began to move, to writhe and twist. They revealed themselves to be something other than vines—they were snakes. Shadow clones were rapidly dispelled as the slithering creatures lunged and snapped their jaws, biting through smoke in an attempt to find the real Naruto. The girl tossed her head back and laughed.</p><p>"Yes, you do know how to play," she commented. "But no one has ever lasted longer than five minutes against my babies."</p><p>"This girl is unhinged." Naruto grumbled as he started slashing at the beasts that were able to get close enough. He was only able to land thin, non-fatal cuts. The snakes were fast, almost as fast as two trained shinobi. Naruto hissed as a snake managed to graze his skin. It didn't break skin but the venom lacing the fangs began to burn away his skin. Naruto gritted his teeth but kept on slashing away with his kunai. He threw out a couple shuriken, hoping that at least some of them would hit but none did. The snakes were too fast.</p><p>Jiraiya was faring much better than Naruto but not by much. He pooled chakra into his hand as he saw a hoard of snakes coming straight for him.</p><p>"Rasengan!" He cried and drove the ball of spinning chakra directly into the center of the hoard. The snakes in the middle disintegrated into ash and the rest blew to pieces, creating a gruesome scene.</p><p>At the sight of her snakes being blown to pieces, the girl stopped her laughing and let out an unearthly, animalistic scream.</p><p>"You dare!" She screeched. "You dare break the most sacred rule!"</p><p>"Sacred rule?" A Naruto yelled. "What sacred rule?"</p><p>The girl's eyes narrowed until they were mere slits.</p><p>"A fox like you should know." She said in a low, dangerous voice. "Only an animal can kill an animal and only a shinobi can kill a shinobi."</p><p>The Narutos kept slicing away, along with the Toad Sannin, trying to take out as many snakes as possible. The girl continued to screech as they killed snake after snake, dispelling most by cutting them in half. Naruto's skin burned where the venom had landed and the burning seemed to be spreading.</p><p>The two Konoha shinobi pushed their way closer and closer to the girl as they cut through the masses, having realized very soon in the battle that the only way to stop the snakes was probably to take out the young woman.</p><p>She wasn't going to make it easy though.</p><p>As if sensing their tactic, the teenage girl backed up further and further. One of the Narutos gaped in amazement before he was poofed out of existence by a snake closing its jaws around his torso. The real Naruto's eyes widened as the observations of his clone entered his mind.</p><p>"Those tattoos on her body are moving!" He called to Jiraiya, who had burned a snake to a crisp using a fire jutsu, only to be bitten by another one. He hissed and hoped that the snake wasn't venomous.</p><p>"They are tattoos." The girl commented. Both Jiraiya and Naruto could only stare as her eyes glowed, her jaw unhinged and fangs emerged. Her body lengthened and her arms and legs melted into her body.</p><p>"She's turning into a snake." Jiraiya whispered, horrified at the monster that was forming, before having to dodge as the girl-turned-snake lunged at him. He pushed Naruto out of the way and was forced back as he dodged repeated strikes. Jiraiya felt himself stepping on a wire trap. Surprisingly it didn't go off.</p><p>A mine, he decided and pivoted, not wanting to step off the wire, lest the trap and the others around it go off.</p><p>"Stop dancing!" Naruto called, running full out towards the largest snake in the group, the snake that once was a girl. A rasengan was in his hand, ready to be delivered.</p><p>The girl was distracted away from Jiraiya and, with a casual flick of her tail, sent Naruto flying. She slithered her way towards Naruto, a new target in mind.</p><p>Jiraiya remained where he was, blocking the occasional attack from a snake. There were nowhere near as many attacks as there were before though. Most of the smaller snakes had disappeared deeper into the forest. Only a third remained of the original amount, and out of those, three-fourths were attacking the Naruto clones. It seemed that they judged Naruto more of a threat than the Toad Sannin. Interesting.</p><p>Naruto gulped as he saw the large female snake heading towards him, fangs bared. He attempted to roll out of the way but unknown to him, his foot was stuck in a fissure that had been hidden before.</p><p>There was a sickening crack and pain shot up Naruto's leg. He let out a loud curse but that was soon cut off by fangs sinking into his other leg. The snake girl didn't stop there. She withdrew her fangs and sank them into Naruto's abdomen, causing the boy to cry out in pain. Naruto's eyes rolled into the back of his head and he promptly passed out, unable to take any more.</p><p>A large thud and the sounds of traps being set off drew the snake's attention away from Naruto and back to Jiraiya, who was standing proudly on a very large toad. Gamabunta.</p><p>The toad and the snake attacked each other promptly, not using any time for verbal attacks. Gamabunta saw Naruto's body convulsing and quickly determined that venom had been injected into his blood system. The strength of it was currently unknown, which meant neither Gamabunta nor Jiraiya was sure if Kyuubi would be strong enough to heal Naruto this time.</p><p>Jiraiya couldn't tell what ended the battle. One minute there was the typical battle scene and then the snakes were just gone. The larger ones could be seen slithering away and the smaller ones, he assumed, did the same under the cover of the forest floor and its many plants. There was no sign of where the snake girl could have gone.</p><p>Not even giving her another thought, Jiraiya rushed over to Naruto. The boy was still convulsing as the venom sped through his body but he was still alive which was always a good thing. The only thing Jiraiya could was set the broken bones before he saw the distinct red aura of Kyuubi's chakra. When he saw it, he knew that the healing process had started.</p><p>Only a couple doses of antidotes were needed to flush the venom out of Jiraiya's system. He had been fortunate. The snakes weren't very poisonous, which was odd in itself. Why use nonvenomous snakes in battle?</p><p>When twilight came about, Naruto still hadn't healed completely enough to be moved safely. His mentor resigned himself to spending the night in the forest. He would have to get firewood though. It might attract the snake-girl back to them but it was a risk that he needed to take. A fire would most likely scare off the other creatures that were lurking in this forest, so it was needed.</p><p>The white-haired man got to his feet with a small sigh. He summoned a smaller toad to keep an eye on Naruto and alert him if things took a turn for the worse. With that done, and his mind partially eased, the older man set out in the southern direction on a search to find some usable firewood.</p><p>Not long after he had left, three figures emerged from the north. All three figures were dressed in black for night travel and all three were wearing masks that had snarling cats painted on them in different colors. A black hood covered their heads and hair. One of them, the one with red paint on her mask, bent down to examine the traps that had been set off.</p><p>"This trap layout could only come from our village." She murmured. "There was no reason for our shinobi to be out here though." Her companions shifted nervously.</p><p>"Has one of our shinobi gone rogue?" The tallest one, a male with blue paint on his mask, asked. "Our village wouldn't necessarily know seeing as a majority of the clans live outside the village. The leaders wouldn't tell the Soshikage either. There's not a lot of trust in our system." He pointed out.</p><p>His comment drew harsh laughs from the original speaker, the one who had inspected the traps.</p><p>"Not a lot of trust indeed." She agreed.</p><p>"A snake, a fox, and someone who has obtained a stolen scroll." The third person, a woman with green paint on her mask, supplied, examining the entire scene, not just the traps like her teammate was doing. Her comment drew a hiss from both her teammates. The stolen scrolls were a sore subject for all the shinobi in their village, her teammates among them.</p><p>"Which scroll?" The man asked in a tight voice, just barely managing to suppress his anger.</p><p>"Toad scroll. We should take the boy and interrogate him to see what he knows."</p><p>In unison, the three turned to stare at Naruto, who was still unconscious.</p><p>"He's an outsider!" The girl in the painted red mask was horrified and shocked. "We can't bring an outsider into the village. The clans would be up in arms."</p><p>"He's also a fox." Her teammate with the green mask pointed out. "If the fox clan finds out that we came across one of their own, one that was injured, and did nothing, that may just be what drives them to accept the protection of the wolf clan. That's the last thing our clan needs, Akahana."</p><p>Akahana snarled under her breath. She turned away from her teammates.</p><p>"Fine. Grab him and let's go. I want to get back. You can deal with the questions then, Yuri."</p><p>Akahana leapt up high, landing on a tree branch almost directly above her. She landed softly, only the faintest whisper telling where she had landed. Yuri looked at her other teammate, seeing what he would do.</p><p>"Izo?" She asked quietly. He sighed.</p><p>"Grab him Yuri. I'll let the Soshikage know of the situation."</p><p>Yuri approached the blonde haired boy slowly, not sure just how much he had healed already. She could hear Izo using his headset to communicate with their village that was only a few miles off. They wouldn't have far to travel.</p><p>"Shoo." She said, shooing off a tiny frog and baby snake that were both watching the boy closing. The toad croaked unhappily at the sight of the snake and bounded off. The baby snake hissed at Yuri before slithering off in the opposite direction as the young toad.</p><p>Gamakichi, once out of sight of the three strangers disappeared in a poof of smoke, wanting to find his boss as soon as possible.</p><p>"Jiraiya! Come quick. It's bad!" He cried, once finding the summoner. "Some people came and took Naruto away."</p><p>Jiraiya felt his stomach sink at the news.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Remember to read and review please! Reviews totally make my day.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>When Naruto awoke, he could instantly tell that he was in the hospital. He had visited friends and spent time in some enough that he could instantly recognize the scent. All hospitals had the same smell—clean and sterile with slight under scents of death and disease. Any shinobi with a decent amount of field training could recognize the look and smell of death. Once experienced, it was something unforgettable. Naruto still had nightmares about the day Haku and Zabuza died.</P><P>Reluctantly, Naruto opened his bright blue eyes, preparing himself for the sea of pure white he was about to see.</P><P>That being said, he was very surprised when the color white didn't burn his eyes. Instead, the walls were painted a light, earthy brown and were covered in murals. In the room was only the bed, a table, a drip that was connected to Naruto via IV, and a cat.</P><P>Naruto blinked and stared at the cat, which was curled into a ball and seemed to be sleeping. After a few minutes, it seemed to sense his staring at it and opened its eyes slowly, as if it was such a great hassle to wake up. It was odd to see a cat in a hospital. The medics in Konoha put up a fuss whenever an animal entered their hospital, even if it was a summon like Pakkun. Something about it being unhygienic or some crap like that.</P><P>Naruto frowned but ignored it. He reached over to tug the IV out of his arm. He didn't need it and it felt uncomfortable.</P><P>"I wouldn't do that if I was you." A male voice commented, causing Naruto to jerk and look around wildly. He automatically reached for a kunai only to find that his pouch wasn't where it normally was.</P><P>Finding no obvious source of where the voice, Naruto's gaze landed on the feline who was still staring at him. Blue eyes narrowed. A summon? That had to mean a shinobi was nearby.</P><P>"Oi, neko-san, where am I?" He demanded. The cat's only response was to yawn and close its eerie yellow eyes. Naruto growled but stopped abruptly as a young woman came into the room. She faltered as Naruto turned his gaze on her and shifted her gaze downwards to the ground.</P><P>She was a very pretty woman but her way of dressing screamed kunoichi, instantly making Naruto very cautious of her. She was wearing a tank dress that fell to knee length and a mesh undersuit. The dress was a pale green with a pink border. Both sides of the dress had slits that started from the ends and went to her hips. There was no headband that signified her allegiance to a certain village, making Naruto even more cautious. Her hair was a silky black that hung in straight sheets down her back. Her skin was deeply tanned and her eyes were a green-yellow with black pupils that were larger than normal. They also were slightly larger than normal and set further apart.</P><P>"Good morning." She said quietly, coming to the bedside to check Naruto's pulse. He instinctively flinched away from her touch, but she ignored the flinch and continued on with her job. She frowned slightly as she took notice of the slower than average pulse and the pale tone to the normally tanned skin. There was a small amount of venom still fighting its way through the system.</P><P>"Honorable patient, I will have to leave the IV in for a bit longer." She informed him. "Not all the venom is out of your system."</P><P>Naruto blinked. Honorable patient? He had never heard a medic call someone <I>that</I> before.</P><P>"I don't need it." He insisted. "My body will take care of it on its own." Well, Kyuubi would.</P><P>"Honorable patient, I would not recommend removing it." The woman still refused to look Naruto in the eye but her voice was firm and Naruto knew it would be a fight to get her to reconsider. Her next comment made Naruto freeze.</P><P>"Not even Kyuubi can heal all wounds."</P><P>Naruto growled and jerked his wrist out of her grasp.</P><P>"Who are you, where am I, and how do you know about Kyuubi?" He demanded angrily. "You're not Akatsuki are you?"</P><P>The kunoichi hesitated, as if reluctant to answer him. Her eyes flickered to the door, as if to check to see if anyone was listening in.</P><P>"Kyuubi has a very significant chakra residue." She said slowly, choosing her words carefully. "I am Yuri and I work here part-time. I have been trained as a healer."</P><P>She paused, and then continued.</P><P>"As for your other questions, which I'm sure you'll have, I am not the one to answer them."</P><P>Naruto held back a snarl. He hated when things were kept from them.</P><P>"I, however, can answer them." A cool voice came from the doorway. The woman, Yuri, turned and inclined her head slightly to the trio standing in the doorway. There was a man at the forefront. He had a very familiar face, but Naruto couldn't place it. He had spiky, long auburn hair that was tied back and was wearing a white gi with red hakama. His eyes were a light brown, almost amber. To his left was a redheaded woman that was wearing a kimono that was cut off at the knees. Her eyes were the same color as the man's. She gave off a matronly air but her sharp gaze reminded Naruto of Tsunade. Definitely not someone to mess with. On his right was another woman, this one having shaggy brown, shoulder length hair and dressed in the same manner as Yuri.</P><P>Yuri bowed to the three and moved away from Naruto. The brown-haired woman watched her through narrow eyes.</P><P>"Thank you for taking over for me, healer-san. I was just coming to collect neko-sama." Yuri said in a voice that revealed nothing. The woman gave a curt nod.</P><P>"Of course, healer-san." She replied. "I shall make sure our honorable patient is taken care of. You should go home and rest, to restore your chakra."</P><P>One thing Naruto was fairly sure of now was that, wherever he was, the people were sure polite. Too polite. It rubbed him the wrong way. Being too polite made a person fake.</P><P>Yuri quickly left, eyes on the ground the entire time. The cat that had been lying on the ground gave a small sigh as it woke up and padded after Yuri, muttering under its breath. Naruto swore he heard it mention something about foxes and annoyances.</P><P>The shaggy haired woman took her place besides Naruto, checking his vitals as Yuri had done. Like Yuri, she didn't remove the IV. Naruto held back a sigh. He wished they would take it out soon.</P><P>No words were exchanged until the brown-haired woman nodded to the other two and left the room. Then the man cleared his throat and offered a small smile to Naruto.</P><P>"It has been a long time since the master of Kyuubi was in the village boundaries." The man began. "I was only a small child when Kyuubi broke through our barrier to the outside, stricken with grief over loosing his last master. An <I>amniael</I> without a master is a dangerous thing, especially to the outside, but the Soshikage at the time refused to send any of our clan out to retrieve Kyuubi."</P><P>"What are you going on about, old man?" Naruto demanded, confused beyond belief. What the heck was an amniael anyways?</P><P>"Kyuubi was born and raised in this village and worked with the shinobi he was bonded to keep the village hidden. Then the shinobi, who he had become very close with, was killed in a coup and he left. He nearly destroyed the barrier as he did. It hasn't been until just recently that the barrier was fully repaired. We suspect the only reason it has been fully repaired is because he is back in the village."</P><P>"Look old man, I don't care about any of this." Naruto snapped. "I just want to know where the hell I am!"</P><P>Both the man and the woman gave him disapproving looks.</P><P>"You are in the Village Hidden by the Animals." The woman said in a stern voice. "My husband is the leader of the fox clan, Uzu Michio and I am Maki Hisano. Now tell us your name so we can know who is Kyuubi's new partner."</P><P>Naruto blinked. Village Hidden by the Animals? Another shinobi village? According to Jiraiya, there was no shinobi village anywhere close to the Untraveable Forest. There was no need for one.</P><P>Then it hit him. Uzu Michio. Maki Hisano. Uzu. Maki.</P><P>The blonde gulped. This conversation was going to get a lot more awkward.</P><P>"My name is Uzumaki Naruto."</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p>Hey all! Back again with another update. I really love these things called break, it allows me time to update, which I feel I don't do often enough.</p><p>In the last chapter I was asked why the cat was called neko-sama and why Naruto was called honorable patient. In Naruto's case, in the Village, names are a very sensitive thing and unless permission is given to use them, the shinobi are often referred to by others as their rank or job. They also didn't know Naruto's name at the time and they were unsure of his rank, which is why they used one of the more polite titles. They also used a polite title because they could feel Kyuubi's chakra in his system. In neko-sama's case, Yuri was the shinobi he worked side by side with. Because of that, she treats him very politely (the suffix "sama") and because she was around people she did not know, she didn't use his name (because once again, names are a very sensitive thing with the shinobi of the Village Hidden by the Animals).</p><p>Hope that cleared some things up and if not, it shall be explained later. This story is partially about culture shock and the different ways people handle it. Now….ENJOY!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto fidgeted as the gazes on him sharpened slightly. He didn't deal well with awkward situations. Then the red-haired woman, Hisano, gave a small, tight smile.</p><p>"Uzumaki, hm?" She said in a strained voice. "The last person to use that name was Kushina and she left the village a long time ago to go after Kyuubi, despite orders not to. She believed that bringing him back would bring great honor to the Clan of the Kitsune, and make it so that the Clan could represent itself, instead of by others."</p><p>Upon receiving an angry look from her husband, the blonde Michio, she stopped talking but threw him an irritated look to show that she wasn't happy by his warning her to be careful with what she said. However, it wasn't like the boy really understood what she had said, if the faint look of confusion in his eyes was anything to go by.</p><p>Naruto had no idea how to respond to Hisano's revelation. He didn't know this woman Kushina, at least not personally, but she carried the same name as him. That meant there was a high possibility that she was a relative but due to the bitter, strained tone of Hisano's voice, Kushina wasn't a fond memory. That might cause some complications further on for Naruto, if these people did turn out to be family.</p><p>Family. Naruto wasn't sure how to feel about that. He had never had a family before. The Sandaime and the shinobi of Konoha had refused to tell Naruto anything about his parents, not even their names. The shinobi had only feigned ignorance when he asked and the Sandaime said that he would know more when the time was right, whatever that meant. Naruto had always felt like an outsider amongst his peers that were surrounded by families, never knowing how it felt. Now that he possibly had family, in a village far outside Konoha, proved that he truly was an outsider. For all he knew, there was no Konoha blood running within his veins.</p><p>No one in the room spoke for the longest time. It seemed that Hisano and Michio also could not think of anything to say as well.</p><p>"So," Naruto began awkwardly, rubbing the back of his head with the arm that wasn't hooked up to the IV. He gave an awkward smile. "What happens next?"</p><p>He was met once again with disapproving looks and laughed nervously. It was like they didn't want him asking questions. Or maybe there was some rule that he was breaking and just didn't know it. With his luck, it could go either way.</p><p>"We are trying to keep your presence in the village a secret." Michio explained. "Many of the shinobi here would not welcome your presence here. Strangers are very much distrusted and unwelcome. As of right now, the only people in the village that are aware of your being here are us, the two healers, and the team that brought you in. Once the venom is out of your system, you will be brought to the Clan's compound and then we shall decide from there what happens."</p><p>His voice left no room for argument. Hisano nodded once in agreement and looked back at the door, as if to make sure no one was listening in. They were a paranoid bunch, in Naruto's opinion.</p><p>"I can leave right now." He said in an insistent voice. He didn't want to be in the hospital and he didn't want to wait any longer to find out his fate. "I don't need this thing in my arm. I'll be fine without it."</p><p>Naruto didn't see Hisano move but the next thing he knew, his head was smarting from a blow he had received. Michio winced at the loud crack that resounded from his wife's hard hit but couldn't help but smirk. The boy had no idea of what he had just gotten himself into. Hisano was very strict when it came obeying healers.</p><p>Naruto glared at Hisano who glared right back. A fan was held in one of her small hands, still folded up and ready to be used again.</p><p>"You have no training in the healing arts, which means you are incapable to say whether or not you are healed. Only a qualified healer will make that decision." She snapped.</p><p>"So you just hit me with a fan?" Naruto cried. "Great idea, obaa-chan! Hit the invalid and lengthen his recovery."</p><p>Hisano's response was to hit him again.</p><p>"Don't call me that and stop acting like a child. You'll be fine. The hit was only to enforce the lesson. I've found the most effective way for a shinobi to learn is through pain."</p><p>Naruto growled and glared at the older woman, but wisely said nothing. He only rubbed the place where he had been hit. Hisano sat back, but she kept the fan out as a clear warning should the boy attempt anything.</p><p>The Soshikage of the Village Hidden by the Animals studied the forms on his desk, seeming to ignore the shinobi standing directly in front of him. He actually was aware of every movement the shinobi made, even those caused by his breaths. Not that they were very big breaths. The shinobi standing in front of the Soshikage held himself perfectly still, not so much as twitching. The shinobi of the Village were known to be extremely paranoid and even the smallest movement could be taken as a threat.</p><p>The Soshikage thought of what he could possibly do about the situation presented to him but he ultimately knew that there was only one option. He had to summon the heads of the clans. He looked at the masked shinobi and nodded slightly.</p><p>"Go." He ordered, green eyes narrowed. "Not a word."</p><p>The shinobi, a boy whose face was hidden by a blue-marked mask, nodded and stepped backwards until he was out of the room. It was only after the door had closed again that he breathed a little easier.</p><p>"Well?" A cool voice asked. The male shinobi turned and faced one of his teammates who had waited outside the office for him.</p><p>"There was only one option." He replied in a voice that revealed nothing. "You'll know what happens as things move along, I'm sure." It wasn't a question. The smaller shinobi, clearly a female by her figure, nodded.</p><p>"Which team do you think they'll put him on?" She asked slyly as they left, as if the decision had been made. Her partner didn't say anything for a long while, but she wasn't expecting an answer right away. She had never received an immediate answer before, so she had learned never to expect one.</p><p>"They'll put him with the dragons. Kotori will become leader and he'll be the new trap-setter." There was no doubt. Every move and action that could possibly happen in the future regarding the strange kitsune's fate had already been calculated and evaluated. The pair was sure of what was to come.</p><p>Naruto, Michio and Hisano had fallen into a tense conversation of small talk, filled by a lot of awkward silences. Naruto was still smarting over the smacks he had received, glaring at the fan that was now resting on the foot of the bed. He was having a hard time adjusting to the way his two elders talked. It was extremely polite and diplomatic. Compared to them, Naruto felt like a crude barbarian.</p><p>A scratching at the door, which had long been closed by Michio, broke one of the silences that the trio had fallen into. Hisano grabbed the fan off the bed and cautiously opened the door, opening the fan as she did. Naruto caught a glimpse of metal ridging, sharpened to kill. A cat trotted in, ignoring Hisano and her fan-turned-weapon. It padded over to Michio, whose eyes narrowed. He was quite familiar with this feline. There was only one reason it left the Soshikage's side.</p><p>"The Council has been summoned. Bring him." The feline said in a female-like voice, before disappearing in a poof of smoke. Michio and Hisano traded concerned looks. Naruto looked between the two, confused.</p><p>"Is this a bad thing?" He asked densely and winced as the fan made contact with his head again.</p><p>"Don't be obtuse." Hisano let a snarl into her voice. "If the Council wants you, then that means they are going to decide whether you live or die."</p><p>Naruto gulped.</p><p>"I thought nobody was supposed to tell!" He yelped. "Do they really have to decide that now?"</p><p>Michio turned his serious gaze on Naruto, who cringed back. That look reminded him of Kakashi-sensei when he was faced with a difficult decision.</p><p>"If the Soshikage has called the Council, then we must respond." He commented in a grave voice. "No information remains secret here for long. Now get that needle out of your arm and let's go."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Done! I hope you enjoyed and please review!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p>Some of you may have noticed that today I have been updating a lot. If you were very thankful that I am and wondering why for all of the updates today, you can thank this story for that. Even though this story has just started, I already have two different endings in mind and I can't choose which to use. It was torture last night when I was trying to sleep because I couldn't get this story out of my mind. So, enjoy!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Being scrutinized by the Council was quite an intimidating experience for Naruto Uzumaki. Not only was he being scrutinized by some of the strangest looking shinobi he had ever come across, but the animals that accompanied them were also judging him.</p><p>Michio stood next to Naruto, face void of any emotion. He looked straight ahead at the largest chair in the circular room, the only chair that wasn't occupied.</p><p>The Council Hall was sort of like an arena, Naruto decided. Where he and Michio were standing was the focus of the room, where battles could have been fought. Naruto tried not to examine the stains on the floor—stains that were obviously bloodstains. All the seats in the room were elevated higher, to give a better viewing point.</p><p>Each seat was currently occupied by a shinobi and the animal that the Clan represented. Hisano had taken Michio's place as the head of the Kitsune Clan. She was seated between the Wolf Clan and the Cat Clan. Other animals being represented by the clans were the Eagles, the Dragons, the Songbirds, the Snakes, the Dogs, the Bears, the Rats, the Deer, the Insects, the Monkeys, and a couple more.</p><p>All in all, there were a lot of people staring at Naruto.</p><p>He looked back at the chair Michio was staring at and jumped slightly. It was no longer unoccupied. Now, a man sat in the chair, looking slightly bored. Behind him, lining the wall, stood ten shinobi.</p><p>The man in the chair had shaggy auburn hair that fell around his face like a mane. His face was leathery looking, with many wrinkles that were partially covered up by the scruff that outlined his chin and jaws. His eyes were green and had a feline-like shape to them.</p><p>The shinobi behind him were dressed all in black. Even their heads and faces were covered. The masks covering their faces reminded Naruto of the ANBU he had occasionally seen in Konohagakure. The only thing that was different was the colors of paint on the masks. All of the shinobi stood at attention and were perfectly still. Not even the animals at their feet moved.</p><p>"Let's begin." The mane-covered man said in a sharp voice. "As everyone is now aware, there is a stranger in our midst. I have been told that he is the host to the Kyuubi no Kitsune, an <i>amniael</i> that left our village many years ago. The stranger was brought to our midst by the neko team who informed me that the scene looked like he had been attacked by one of our shinobi. Soon after he was brought to our village, the barrier was fully repaired. His fate is in your hands, Council."</p><p>It was silent as the Council members took everything in and then all hell broke loose. Each Clan leader was trying to make him or herself heard above all the others. Quite a few times, Naruto heard the suggestion that he be killed. Then the leader of the Deer clan stood up. He gazed at the auburn-haired man.</p><p>"Soshikage-sama," he began respectfully, "Why do we not hear what the neko team has seen? After all, they have a gift for predicting what will happen."</p><p>The room quieted down at his comment. The Soshikage looked back at the shinobi standing against the wall. He nodded slowly and one of the shinobi came forward. The form was feminine and there was green paint on the cat-shaped mask.</p><p>"With all due respect to the Deer Clan and the rest of the clans, we cannot do that." She said quietly and deferentially. "We do not have a gift for predicting the future. We are just able to analyze what has been said and done and apply that to the current situation."</p><p>It took all of Naruto's restraint to not point and shout in surprise. He knew that voice. It was Yuri!</p><p>Another shinobi stepped forward.</p><p>"Besides, who is to say that once we tell you what will happen that it will actually happen. The final decision rests in the Soshikage's hands and cats are…unpredictable." Her voice was cold and sly, made all that more menacing by the red paint on her mask. Her comment drew wary looks from the Council members and some laughed nervously.</p><p>The two kunoichi stepped back and nothing more was said. The auburn-haired man that Naruto now recognized as the Soshikage leaned forward in his chair.</p><p>"So what are the options the Council has come up with?" He asked.</p><p>"Death." A reptilian-like man said firmly, a snake curled around his neck. A few others nodded in agreement with him.</p><p>"Removal of the boy and the Kitsune Clan from the village. The Kitsunes are more trouble than they're worth." That came from a small woman with long legs and arms. A monkey sat at her feet, holding her hand gently but protectively, like a mother with a child.</p><p>"Don't let the boy leave." This time it was an actual dog that spoke up. His ears were perked forward. "Even I can tell that it's only a matter of time before the Kyuubi no Kitsune breaks free of the boy, if he remains without the proper training. If he leaves, I suspect that the barrier will shatter for good. For the good of the Village, he needs to remain here until he and Kyuubi can truly become a pair."</p><p>"Train the boy?" The Soshikage lost his bored look and became more interested. "Is that what you're saying dog-sama? Train the boy and give him our secrets?"</p><p>None of the Council members looked pleased. The Soshikage looked at Hisano in a sly manner.</p><p>"And what does the Kitsune Clan have to say about this?" He asked. "After all, your Clan is the one that will be directly affected by this boy."</p><p>"When has the Kitsune Clan ever had a say?" Hisano replied, not looking at the Soshikage. "Kitsunes were born from a Wolf and a Cat and we still look to both of them for final judgments." There was a bitter tone to her voice. The Soshikage gave her a patronizing smile and turned to the Wolf Clan. She was scowling at him and the wolf beside her had his hackles up and teeth bared.</p><p>"The way I see it, Soshikage-sama, is that there are three teams behind you, only two of which the boy can join. One is the neko team, which gives the Cat Clan more control over the boy. The other is the flier team, which the boy clearly isn't suited for because the last time I checked, foxes can't fly. However, to avoid a civil war, the option is to put the boy with the fliers, however unsuited he may be for that team. If you wish to spite the Wolf Clan, then you would put the boy with the neko team."</p><p>Even Naruto could hear the woman daring the Soshikage to choose that option. The Soshikage sighed and cracked his neck, before looking down at Michio and Naruto.</p><p>"It seems that there is only one logical choice as I know the Kitsunes would start a civil war if we dared put the Kyuubi no Kitsune down." He declared. "Dog-sama is right, the barrier wouldn't survive if we banished the boy. As I do not wish to start a civil war, there is only one option."</p><p>Naruto tensed slightly, biting his lip in order to keep silent. He didn't want to remain here, in this Village. Already he could tell that the people in it had some serious problems.</p><p>"Why can't I make my own decisions?" He blurted out. "It's my life after all!"</p><p>He winced as Michio hit him upside the head. Hisses and growls came from all over the room. The Soshikage sat back, looking faintly surprised. He looked at Naruto through narrow eyes as the boy rubbed the back of his head and glared at Michio.</p><p>"From the moment you entered the Village, it was no longer just your life." The auburn-haired male told the blond. "Anyone who enters the Village Hidden by the Animals becomes a part of the Village, something that was made apparent by the barrier restoring itself. If you leave, the entire Village will be effected, not just yourself."</p><p>Naruto growled. He knew when he was being lectured and he was clearly being lectured at the current moment. His hand clenched, forming a fist. The reaction was immediate.</p><p>The kunoichi with the cold voice moved the first, appearing next to Naruto without appearing to move. The move reminded Naruto of Kakashi-sensei, so he could only assume that she was the level of a jounin. She yanked his hand back and pulled it out of the fist formation it had assumed. Naruto let out a yelp at the suddenness of everything.</p><p>"When the Soshikage is before you, any movement can be taken as a threat." The kunoichi informed Naruto. "Lesson number one."</p><p>Naruto glared at the girl and tried to shake her off, but she didn't let go. Through her mask, he could see bright green eyes. They glared back at him. Apparently the girl wasn't as cold as her voice made her out to be. At least she still showed emotions, unlike some of the shinobi Naruto had met in his first year as a shinobi.</p><p>The Soshikage let out a chuckle.</p><p>"Let the boy go. I'm not threatened by him." He told the girl, who immediately dropped Naruto's arm like it was on fire. "He'll learn."</p><p>"Your decision, Soshikage-sama?" The Wolf Clan leader prompted after a tense moment. The Soshikage smiled.</p><p>"Ah, yes. That." He glanced at the nine shinobi still standing behind him. "Listen carefully, for I won't be lenient if my orders aren't followed. Atsuo, Kotori, teach the boy in the art of trapping. I have a feeling that he'll excel in that field. The wolf team and the neko team will be working closely together from now on, sharing missions and such, starting at dawn tomorrow."</p><p>The Wolf Clan leader let out a loud growl, now knowing what was about to happen. The Soshikage gave her a mischievous look.</p><p>"The boy shall join the neko team as their trapper but will also be learning from the wolf team and the flier team shall be the mediators. I believe that won't start a civil war." He announced. "Your first mission will be at dawn, given to you on the Akai bridge. Think of this as a way to peacefully bond the Clans. Failure is not an option."</p><p>The Soshikage stood up and left the room through a door that the shinobi had been blocking. His leaving quickly meant that none of the Clans, or Naruto, had time to protest his decision.</p><p>Michio turned to stare at the kunoichi that was still standing next to Naruto.</p><p>"Was that the decision you were expecting?" He asked in an overly curious voice. Spending years on the Council had trained his eyes to detect the slightest movement, so he could tell that the girl was shaking.</p><p>"No." There was barely concealed rage in the cold voice. The kunoichi turned to Naruto and bowed slightly.</p><p>"At dawn, Kitsune." She said in farewell. "Don't be late."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Read and review please!

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><p>Hey! Here's another chapter that I hope you will all enjoy. It's not as long as I hoped it would be, but I'm very satisfied with this chapter. Enjoy!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>That night, it was impossible for Naruto to fall asleep in his sparsely decorated room. After the Council meeting Hisano and Michio had led him to their home, which was located on the eastern most side of the village. Their home was bigger than Naruto expected it to be, certainly too big for just three people to live there. It could easily hold ten or more people, the size of a small clan. Almost immediately, with no words of explanation, Hisano had led Naruto to the room in which he currently sat and left the seething boy there.</p><p>Naruto could not get the Council meeting off his mind. Whenever Naruto thought about how the decision had just been made by the Soshikage, without him being able to give any say, he growled and spat under his breath. He was a shinobi of Konoha, not this village, so he didn't understand what they were getting out of this whole situation. When a foreign village captured shinobi, the captives were normally subjected to torture or right out killed, not placed on a shinobi team. Sure, something about a barrier had been mentioned, but surely Naruto only needed to be kept alive for the barrier to remain intact. There was no need for him to be placed on a team.</p><p>Naruto also kept seeing the faces of the Council members after the Soshikage had made his announcement. There had been many reactions, but all were disturbing in their own way. The most common of reactions had been outrage, which didn't surprise Naruto in the slightest. No proper shinobi would want an outsider learning their secrets and living among them.</p><p>It was the ones who didn't react with rage that Naruto was more worried about. The reptilian man who had demanded his death in the Council meeting had left as soon as he had heard the Soshikage's decision, not allowing his reaction to be seen. The leader of the Wolf Clan had left immediately as well, but not without giving Naruto and the Soshikage a look that sent shivers down Naruto's spine. The Soshikage had given a small, deep laugh that clearly showed that he wasn't concerned by the death stares he had received by his Council.</p><p>The leader of the Deer Clan, the one that had asked the shinobi on guard what had been foreseen, had an amused look on his face. He was one of the few that hadn't seemed put out by the decision that had been made. The shinobi representing the Songbird and Eagle clans also looked amused, though the leader of the Eagle Clan had a more predatory look in her eye, as if she could gain something from the turmoil in the Council Hall.</p><p>Hisano had only sat there, between the Wolf Clan and the Cat Clan, face perfectly impassive. The leader of the Cat Clan had a smirk on his face as he stood up to leave, throwing a mocking look at the leader of the Wolf Clan as he left the Council Hall, who had snarled in reply.</p><p>Naruto felt a chill run down his spine as he remembered that snarl. It had come from the very depths of the woman, resonating all through the Council Hall. The shinobi behind the Soshikage had tensed but Naruto hadn't seen what happened since that was when Michio had decided to leave.</p><p>With a loud sigh, Naruto sat up in the small bed, cracking his neck and back to get rid of some extra stiffness. He clenched his hands into fists. He couldn't stay in this room any longer but every time he tried to wander about, Hisano always found him and brought him back to the room. The first time she had taken him to the kitchen for a small dinner but after the meal, the blonde-haired boy was right back where he started. Naruto felt like a prisoner.</p><p>However, maybe he would get lucky this time. After all, Hisano couldn't stay up all night to make sure he didn't leave the house. She had to sleep sometime. Shinobi had trained their bodies to be pushed as much as possible but even they needed to rest.</p><p>Quietly, Naruto left his bed and tried to approach the door silently, pausing whenever the floorboards creaked. As the door got closer and closer, Naruto could feel his chest tightening in excitement. He was so close to freedom that he could smell it.</p><p>Naruto sucked in a breath as he placed his hand on the door handle. He had pulled off many escape attempts due to all the pranks he had pulled as an academy student and each time he had the same rush of adrenaline.</p><p>Letting out his breath, Naruto twisted the cool metal doorknob and pulled on the door, relieved when it didn't creak and alert Michio or Hisano to his escape.</p><p>The adrenaline disappeared when Naruto saw what lay beyond the door. Not expecting to see anyone, the blond leaped to the other side of the room and took a defensive stance when he registered the dark shape standing right in front of him.</p><p>The nurse from the hospital, Yuri, stood in the doorway, hand raised as if she was about to knock. She looked at Naruto with a dull look in her eye.</p><p>"Your reflexes are slow," she commented. "Every second counts. You shouldn't have even opened the door with me standing behind it."</p><p>"Why are you here?" Naruto demanded, still clearly startled. He was breathing heavily after his start. The black-haired woman kept staring at Naruto with that dull look in her eyes. It gave her an exhausted look to her face.</p><p>"Dawn will be coming soon," she explained in a monotone voice. "We need to leave for the training grounds."</p><p>Out of habit, Naruto looked for a window to see if she was right. Then he remembered the tiny fact that had made him feel the most imprisoned. There was no window. He had been given a room in the center of the house, not one on the side.</p><p>"Already?" the blue-eyed boy whined. Yuri didn't reply, deciding instead to turn around and walk down the hall. She wanted to leave the Kitsune house as quickly as possible and meet her siblings, who would hopefully be waiting with tea or a light breakfast. After the Council meeting she had gone back to the hospital to take up another shift. Normally she would have been finished by midnight and could have had a few hours of sleep, but a team had come in, carting a severely injured shinobi that had been a part of the Cat Clan. Despite a long, extensive surgery, he had not survived the night.</p><p>It was the third such incident that taken place in the past two months and the ninth since the beginning of the year. There was no consistent pattern to the deaths but Yuri had a feeling that the same person was behind all of them. Numerous times she had come across traces of poison within the dead body but it was none that she could recognize. There was a definite need for concern.</p><p>Naruto decided not to follow Yuri, still not wanting to go along with this whole thing that the Soshikage had decided and the others had agreed to. Yuri didn't look back, deciding that if the boy chose to not show up, that was his own fault. He didn't know what he was getting himself into and she wasn't going to be late on his account.</p><p>Izo and Akahana lounged around the training grounds with their feline companions, waiting for their teammates to show up. Neither of them was speaking to the other, though Izo was watching Akahana closely, waiting for the outburst to come. Neither had been happy with the Soshikage's decision, feeling like he had made it only to prove that he could but Akahana had a tendency to react more violently.</p><p>"He's not with her." Akahana stated, sitting up as she saw Yuri come into sight alone. She growled under her breath, which was mimicked by the female hellcat that had been destroying a nearby tree with her claws. Izo smirked, not at all surprised. He hadn't expected the boy to give in without a fight. No proper shinobi would. They would accept their orders from the Soshikage without a question but that didn't mean they would follow those same orders without a fight. To fight back was in a shinobi's nature after all.</p><p>"Forget him. We have training to do," he ordered simply, wondering if Akahana would follow his orders. He was the team leader officially, but that had never stopped his distant cousin from disobeying his orders before. She acted like the perfect shinobi, never questioning, never failing to follow orders but that was only a façade. Like any shinobi in their Village, she was capable of double-crossing others without blinking an eye. "After all, Yuri had no problem doing so."</p><p>Yuri gave her older brother a tight-lipped smile. Akahana glowered at the siblings.</p><p>"You both can do so," she pointed out. "I, however, can't. The Soshikage gave an order and it must be obeyed."</p><p>"</p><p>"He whines," she stated simply, not looking at Akahana, who let out another snarl.</p><p>"Of course he does!" Akahana had finally snapped. Not that it was surprising. Her teammates had actually expected her to break much earlier than this. "In shinobi law, he's an adult but he still acts like a child. That much was evident yesterday. He has no control over his emotions, and subsequently his actions."</p><p>Yuri coughed, disguising a laugh. Akahana and the boy were actually very similar in that way. Then there was the fact that they both liked to wear bright colored clothing…foxes and cats were apparently more similar than the Clans liked to think.</p><p>"Hotaru, we're hunting." The red-haired shinobi got to her feet. Hotaru abandoned her scratching post, making a sound that was a mix of a snarl and a purr as the pair stalked away. She was always willing to go on a hunt, especially when it involved human prey—prey that could fight back.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>If you enjoyed the chapter, please review!

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><p>Whew! This chapter was a toughie but I'm happy with the way it turned out, especially the ending. I'd like to dedicate this chapter to the Underground Fanfictioners group on Facebook because without them, this probably would have taken a lot longer. I love you guys. I also recently got a Tumblr and the link is posted on my profile page if you're interested.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto let out a curse and spat on the ground in frustration. He had managed to get out of the maze-like house without being spotted only to get lost in the surrounding village. It wasn't that it was hard to navigate the streets but there was a distinctive lack of landmarks. All the buildings were built in the same style and painted in the same color. The signs were generic and often shops had the same name as other shops that sold the same product. There wasn't even a marked exit or entrance to the village that Naruto could find. Instead of walls surrounding the village, there were sprawling estates that looked like clan homes and the edge of the forest. It was tempting to just dash into the forest and travel until he reached the other side but even Naruto wasn't that stupid. He and Jiraiya had gotten lost numerous times at the beginning of their travels, despite marking their path. There was something about that forest that set his nerves on edge. He predicted that if he went in there alone, he wouldn't come out alive.</p><p>A growl emerged from Naruto's throat as he passed yet another sign that read 'Food'. These people had no originality apparently. He was so frustrated that he failed to see the large cat padding silently along the flat, connected rooftops behind him, tail twitching in anticipation. The ginger hellcat lifted a back paw gingerly and Naruto's stalker struck a second later.</p><p>The rushing wind alerted Naruto that someone was approaching quickly and he had just enough time to form the hand seal to make a clone that replaced his actual being.</p><p>Akahana's eyes widened as the form she grabbed literally poofed out of existence but turned nimbly and steadied herself for another lunge. Naruto's blue eyes narrowed as he faintly recognized the girl who had attacked him. The green eyes were what gave her away.</p><p>"You again?" Naruto barked out. Akahana gave a tiny smirk but didn't reply, choosing to take the opportunity to attack again. Naruto was barely able to dodge out of the way but he didn't come away completely intact. The green-eyed girl had managed to scrape the top of his head and rip out a good chunk of his hair as she passed over him and stopped a few feet away. It hurt but it was nowhere as bad as what Naruto had suffered before.</p><p>"What the hell are you playing at?" Naruto demanded as the girl turned back towards him. "Aren't you supposed to be one of those people <i>training</i> me?"</p><p>The green-eyed girl lunged for Naruto again, this time faster than before. She definitely had the speed of a jounin. Since she was only a few feet away at the start of her lunge, there was no chance for Naruto to avoid her a third time. The force of the impact was enough to knock the blonde boy over and sent him skidding a few feet on the ground. Akahana remained on top of him as they went flying. As the pair came to a stop, she quickly dug her knee into the place she knew that would leave any male shinobi in tears.</p><p>"Yuri was right," she remarked. "You <i>are</i> the whiny type. Now come along. Izo does not like to be kept waiting." She rolled off Naruto and got to her feet quickly, looking around to see if any spying shinobi had noticed the brief tussle. Naruto gasped in pain and gaped at her.</p><p>"What the hell is your problem?" He asked again. His assailant quirked an eyebrow and gave him a cold look.</p><p>"Currently? You," she replied. "If you don't follow me, I've given Hotaru permission to take a bite or two out of you."</p><p>"Hotaru?" Naruto didn't recognize the name. The watching hellcat perked up at her name and jumped off the roof, over Akahana and Naruto's heads, and landed on the empty street. Her large paws easily absorbed the impact of the landing. Her tail waved in greeting and Akahana allowed a mischievous grin to slip onto her lips.</p><p>"She's a hellcat," she informed the younger boy. "Traditionally they guard the gates of hell and feed on the tortured souls within but Hotaru is a bit <i>different</i>. Tortured souls hold no appeal to her."</p><p>"Why eat the dead when the living flesh tastes better?" The hellcat questioned, purring loudly. She gave Naruto a once-over, sniffed, and turned to her partner. "I'm not sure that I would like his flesh, though. He is the host of Kyuubi after all, so he probably tastes like a fox. I don't enjoy eating other predators."</p><p>"Aren't humans predators?" Naruto muttered under his breath. The hellcat, whose back came up to Naruto's waist, gave him a dirty look.</p><p>"You like to think so. I just associate humans with leeches and other parasites. You have the same effect, after all."</p><p>"Charming as always, Hotaru," a cool voice remarked and two figures jumped down from nearby roofs. One of them was Yuri. The other was Izo, who still hadn't been introduced to Naruto. Izo was giving the Kyuubi container a chilling glare.</p><p>"You followed me," stated Akahana, grin slipping off her face. An emotionless mask replaced it. Izo ignored her.</p><p>"Since we're all here, we're starting our mission now. The wolf team and the flier team have already had a head start," he began, speaking in crisp tones. "They've probably hidden their flags already and are trying to find ours by now."</p><p>"Flag?" Naruto tilted his head. How was hiding flags a mission?</p><p>"Training mission. We're playing capture the flag." Yuri said in a quiet voice. "Ours is about to be hidden right now."</p><p>"Oh?" Akahana raised an eyebrow, looking at her cousins. Yuri smirked and Izo pulled a flag from the inside of his jacket. He tied it around Hotaru's neck as the hellcat wrapped herself around him, purring like a kitten.</p><p>Naruto just stared at the three. They were playing a game? They trained by playing games? Not even Kakashi-sensei had tried that with their team before Sasuke had gone after Orochimaru.</p><p>"That's it? We're playing a game?" He voiced his disbelief. Izo and Akahana traded sly glances.</p><p>"It's harder than it looks," Akahana admitted. "Catch as many as you can and I'll work on finding the flags." She and Hotaru took off together, the hellcat overtaking her human partner with her longer strides.</p><p>"There are three teams participating. Our team, the wolf team, and the flier team. We've hidden our flag on Hotaru, because Akahana and Izo are the only ones that will willingly get close to her. The fliers have most likely attached their flag to a bird, so we need to keep a close eye on the sky," Yuri explained. "Last time we did this, the wolf team hid their flag in the Wolf Clan estate. If they do the same, theirs will be the easiest to get to.</p><p>"One person has to stay by their team's flag, so once we figure out who's guarding the flag, the game becomes easier. It also leaves the wolf team with three people to defend our flag against and two for the flier team. Number-wise, it would be easier to find the fliers and take out the two that aren't guarding the flag because that will leave their flag virtually unprotected.</p><p>"However, since there are more than two teams, we have to worry about teams working together. We could try to recruit one of the other two teams, but the wolf team would never work with us, especially when the other team is down a member. The flier team might work with us but they would probably choose to work with the wolf team because wolves don't typically go after birds for meals, unlike cats. However, they could possibly work with us because we've got a fox on our team."</p><p>Naruto's head hurt. Yuri was doing way too much analytical thinking for him to keep up with.</p><p>"Ano, is this how the game normally goes? You're making this way too complicated," he informed the pair.</p><p>"This isn't even the half of it," Izo muttered. "I sincerely hope you aren't a high-ranking shinobi where you come form if you can't even do this basic analysis."</p><p>Now Naruto's pride was hurt as well.</p><p>"It's simple! Just find the flag, barge in with a bunch of clones, and steal it."</p><p>Yuri and Izo cringed at his obliviousness.</p><p>"If you want to get everyone killed, that's the best way to go about it. I would have thought that you would have been taught by now that barging in will only end in disaster." Izo's tone was condescending and Naruto's hands clenched into fists.</p><p>"It's worked fine in the past," he said, angry tones coloring his voice. Izo gave a small scoff.</p><p>"And how many times has someone come in and saved you because you did something stupid? How many times have you or a teammate nearly died?"</p><p>Naruto said nothing. He refused to admit that the other boy might be right. Yuri just stood by silently, waiting for something to happen, whether it be flying fists or an ambush from another team.</p><p>"Is that why we found you unconscious and nearly dead from the poison within your system?" Izo continued. Naruto said nothing again, choosing instead to look away. Izo gave a tight-lipped smile. There was still a slight smidgen of hope for the boy. At least he knew that there were times when it was best to remain silent, neither denying nor confirming anything.</p><p>"Wolves incoming," Yuri announced, head turned to the right, in the opposite direction that Akahana had gone. Naruto looked as well but couldn't see anyone or anything.</p><p>"Fukuyo and Miyu," Izo confirmed, keeping an eye on the rest of the street.</p><p>"Do we risk taking them out now?" Yuri questioned, hand twitching to where she kept her smaller weapons.</p><p>"Their sense of smell is better than ours, so they know that we're around. Since we haven't moved for a while, they might have assumed we're guarding the flag. If we don't attack, they'll attack us," Izo murmured.</p><p>"I know your opinion of canines isn't that high but I doubt that they're dumb enough to believe that we have three people sitting on a flag," Yuri remarked, eyes scanning the area.</p><p>"We've come up with stupider plans," Izo reminded her. "Still, they'll be watching and since they haven't attacked yet, they'll probably be waiting for us to split up before attacking. Akahana better not come back. She'd walk into their trap and the game would be lost before we get there."</p><p>"You don't have any faith in your teammate?" Naruto asked. That seemed a little harsh to him. Even Kakashi-sensei had faith in his team, enough to leave them to fight their battles alone, even when they were outnumbered.</p><p>"Faith requires trust and you can't trust anyone in this village. We learn that from our cradles. You can only trust your clan and pretend to trust everyone else."</p><p>Okay. It was very harsh. How was the village still standing if no one trusted each other? Naruto knew what it was like to have trust issues but he was still willing to trust others. He couldn't imagine what it would be like to grow up with no one to trust. At least he had had Iruka-sensei.</p><p>Quiet howls reached his ears. They sounded playful and taunting.</p><p>"Rikiya joined them," Yuri recognized one howl in particular. "That means Atsuo is the one that's with the flag, most likely."</p><p>"Or they could have three people sitting on their flag," Naruto muttered under his breath. Izo gave him a slightly annoyed look.</p><p>"If they would be dumb enough to believe that the three of us are sitting on that stupid flag, wouldn't they also be dumb enough to place three people on their own flag."</p><p>That may have possibly been one of Naruto's brighter moments regarding battlefield strategy. Yuri sighed and Izo gave Naruto a calculating look.</p><p>"Why don't you tell us," he said after a moment. "After all, you have more of a canine-like mind than either of us."</p><p>Naruto wasn't sure what that was supposed to mean, but he felt like he had just been insulted.</p><p>"So that whole cat-dog rivalry does exist then," he mentioned. Yuri scowled.</p><p>"That word, rivalry, is only a pebble on a mountain. Now shut up so we can hear if anyone approaches."</p><p>A large roar sounded on the other side of the village, followed by a piercing scream. Yuri and Izo muttered curses under their breath.</p><p>"Was that the green-eyed chick with the large cat?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"Akahana," Yuri confirmed. "And don't let her catch you referring to her as 'the green-eyed chick.' She brought our clan great glory four years ago and must be respected, even though she is not the team leader."</p><p>Of course. She was probably some sort of prodigy, like Sasuke. Naruto always seemed to end up with the prodigies. At least it explained the attitude somewhat. All the prodigies seemed to have piss-poor attitudes.</p><p>"Time to go," Izo said suddenly. "The wolf team has moved away." Yuri smirked and turned to Naruto.</p><p>"Try and keep up, why don't you," she said, preparing to run. Naruto had no time to formulate a response before they were moving, moving away from the village center and into the forest. The pace was quicker than what Naruto was used to and the pace he was used to was fairly quick to begin with. After a little over six months of traveling with Jiraiya had shown him that the old man waited for no one. They had to travel as quickly as possible between villages. That way Naruto could spend more time training in each village and Jiraiya could get more research done. It also lengthened the distance between them and any who might be tracking them.</p><p>"Use your senses," Yuri hissed as she fell back slightly. "Think like the fox inside you. Call out to him. Use his ears. Smell through his nose. Let your hands and feet become like paws. Think like a fox. <i>Become </i>the fox."</p><p>No one had ever given him such advice before. Most of the Konoha shinobi, including the late Third Hokage, had chosen to ignore the fox within him and only focus on Naruto's chakra and jutsu. Jiraiya-sensei had only encouraged him to take Kyuubi's chakra and use it for his own gain. No one had ever encouraged him to become one with the demon within him.</p><p>"<i>Do it!</i>" Yuri hissed as Naruto hesitated. The blond took a deep breath and nodded. He wasn't sure quite what to do so he tried to imagine what it would be like to be a fox. He imagined it would be simpler. There would be no need to worry about what others thought or how they acted. There would be no friends or enemies, just those that he would tolerate and those who he needed to drive away from his territory or would become his prey.</p><p>The weather was warmer than usual around this time of year. That meant the nights would be warmer and his prey would be more willing to venture further from their dens. That made things easier. He wouldn't have to venture out in the middle of the day for a much needed meal. He couldn't wait until he had finished his hunt. He needed to feel the ripping of fur, the crunching of bones, the warm blood soaking his teeth.</p><p>Slowly but surely, Naruto felt the changes within his body. The sounds he used to barely be able to pick up on were now as easily heard as someone speaking in a normal tone. He could smell the animals on the forest floor and the oncoming rain. It would storm tonight most likely. He felt nimbler and gradually picked up speed as he began to use his hands as well as his feet to travel amongst the trees.</p><p>The last change was his eyesight. It wasn't as gradual as everything else. Naruto blinked and when his eyes reopened, everything was tinged in red and movements became sharper, easier to pick up on.</p><p>In the back of his mind, Naruto could hear the growling of Kyuubi. It wasn't the angry roar he had been subjected to the past couple of times he had encountered his prisoner. Instead, it was almost a purr. Kyuubi knew where he was and he was content for the time being.</p><p>For the time being, Naruto and Kyuubi could no longer be considered to separate beings—the jailor and the prisoner. They were one, with the same mindset. Becoming one with Kyuubi wasn't as frightening as Naruto had believed it to be. It was freeing. It was exhilarating.</p><p>This was how it was supposed to be.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Read and review please!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><p>Yuri watched Naruto out of the corner of her eye. She knew what he was feeling right now. She had experienced it, too. The first time one of their shinobi connected with their inner being was always the most exhilarating. The next step would be to bring the Kyuubi out of his prison inside Naruto. It would take some time before that would happen, though. To do so would require an extremely threatening situation or a lot of patience. There was also a matter of that seal… Yuri wasn't sure if it would hinder the process of removing the Kyuubi or if she would be able to make a crack in the seal to draw Kyuubi out. It looked very strong. The person who made it must have been well versed in sealing techniques.</p><p>Izo slid to a stop and held out his hands, signaling for silence. Yuri obeyed automatically. Naruto obeyed as well, but much more hesitantly. He let out a faint whine as he stopped, earning a sharp look from Izo.</p><p>"We'll set up traps here," Izo murmured quietly. "Sooner or later, the wolf team or the flier team will come this way and hopefully we'll be able to stall them enough with the traps to capture a team member."</p><p>Izo cast a glance towards Naruto who raised an eyebrow.</p><p>"We also need to teach this one how to trap, as he's to be our new trapper for the time being," he continued. Naruto scowled at that.</p><p>"I know how to set up traps," he snapped. Izo gave a harsh laugh.</p><p>"An exploding tag here? A chakra wire there? That could never be considered trapping. I mean traps where if a shinobi steps even in one wrong spot, the explosion will be seen for miles around."</p><p>Izo slid a bag off his back. Naruto peered at it closely. He hadn't noticed it before. It was rather large for a shinobi to be carrying. It would be a hindrance in battle and would only add extra weight and bulk for speed and stealth missions.</p><p>"We'll only set up the basic trap layout right now," Izo muttered, pulling a scroll out of the bag and unrolling it. Naruto peered at it closely. It was just a bunch of lines, stars, and slash marks, written in two different colors.</p><p>"Black is always the first layer. Blue is second. On more advanced patterns, green is third, brown is fourth, and red is fifth," Yuri explained.</p><p>"Layers?" Naruto asked. Yuri nodded.</p><p>"The lines are where the chakra wires go. Stars are where we put the devices that trigger the traps and slash marks are the trap itself. Traps include exploding tags, catapults that will launch kunai and shuriken, smoke bombs, poisonous gas, and anything else you can think of. Traps can be in trees, hidden in brush, or even buried underground."</p><p>"You need blueprints to lay these out? Sounds like a waste of time," Naruto grumbled, locking his arms behind his head.</p><p>"Trapping is only good when you know that it will take a while for your opponent to reach you or if you're defending a certain location," Izo admitted. "We need the blueprints because there are hundreds of ways to set these up and to figure out how to take them down without setting anything off. Most shinobi in the village are rather paranoid and wouldn't be amused if we caused an explosion."</p><p>"Yeah, I noticed that this isn't a humorous lot," Naruto muttered under his breath. "Maybe if you loosened up a little, everyone wouldn't be ready to kill everyone else."</p><p>"Just hurry up," Yuri hissed. "We've waited around too long. I don't want to walk into an ambush."</p><p>Izo stiffened at being given an order but quickly began setting up traps. Naruto watched closely, amazed by the process. It was like putting together a puzzle. Every wire Izo strung was connected to at least three triggers and traps and five other wires. It was quite the process.</p><p>"So do we need to get both of the other flags or just one other?" Naruto asked as they began moving on.</p><p>"Both of them," Yuri said. "When we get one, we'll have to be twice as careful because if we're attacked, then there's a possibility that the other teams can get both flags. That's why we split up. Makes it more difficult to obtain a flag."</p><p>The sound of approaching footsteps made the trio slide to a stop and pull out their weapons. Naruto and Yuri pulled out kunai but Izo grabbed another object that had been strapped to his back.</p><p>"What is that?" Naruto questioned, eyeing the strange object. It had sharp ridges but one side of it was made up of wire and there was a large hole in the center. Izo pulled out a piece of wood that was tipped with razor sharp steel and laid it across the foreign weapon.</p><p>"Bow and arrow. Good for long distance fighting but the sharpened edges also allow for close combat fighting. Slash it across an opponent's skin and it cuts right down to the bone, slicing through muscle, organs, and veins," Izo explained as he looked for his target. "Now shut up."</p><p>"So why aren't you getting your hand sliced off?" Naruto asked curiously. Izo glared at him and refused to answer.</p><p>"Look at his hands," Yuri whispered. Naruto did so and then noticed that the other boy was wearing gloves that protected his hands from any damage. Peering closer, Naruto could see where the bow had left its mark. There were countless scratches and slits where it had dug into the fabric.</p><p>Akahana burst through the trees, Hotaru close behind her, and neatly dodged the arrow Izo let loose in her direction. Landing softly, she glared at the older boy.</p><p>"You know, just once, I would like not to get shot at," she growled. Izo stared at her impassively.</p><p>"It keeps you on your toes," he replied. "Or, if you would rather, come up with a signal that lets us know it's you and not someone else."</p><p>Akahana narrowed her eyes but said nothing.</p><p>"Atsuo had the flag for the wolf team. I managed to take it from him in a fight," she reported, waving the said object.</p><p>"A fair fight?" Izo asked. Akahana snorted.</p><p>"Not really. He'll be whining about it when we finish and meet up."</p><p>"What about that scream we heard earlier?"</p><p>Akahana shrugged her shoulders.</p><p>"Nothing to concern yourself with. I'm fine now," she said calmly. "Tobikuma and Shouta are out by the way. Kotori has the flag."</p><p>"How did Tobikuma and Shouta get out?"</p><p>"Shouta was taken out by Fukuyo, Rikiya, and Miyu and I was able take Tobikuma out while they were occupied with Shouta."</p><p>"Are you going to give any actual details or just vague answers?" Izo asked in an irritated voice.</p><p>"Just vague answers," Akahana replied with a small grin. Hotaru chuffed a little. Izo sighed.</p><p>"Did you find out where the fliers have hid their flag?" he asked.</p><p>"With Kotori," Akahana replied slowly. Izo scowled.</p><p>"And where is she?" he asked.</p><p>"Trapped in behind the eagle estate."</p><p>"Trapped in?" Naruto tilted his head. "Couldn't you have just gotten it when she was trapped?"</p><p>"Trapped in means she set up traps around a certain location, like a tree, and placed herself and the disablers in the center, so the only way to get to her is to avoid all the traps or to set them off. How many layers?"</p><p>"Four," Akahana replied. "One underground, one low to the ground, one at waist height, and one at shoulder height. The only way to avoid them is if you can cut yourselves into pieces."</p><p>"So it's a stalemate," Yuri sighed.</p><p>"Maybe not," Izo replied, eyeing Naruto with a look in his eye that made the younger boy shift nervously.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Naruto stared at a large tree and then back at Izo.</p><p>"So I should…"</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>"Just go right in?"</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>"And set off as many as possible?"</p><p>"Yep."</p><p>"Weren't you the one who was saying that we shouldn't just charge right into things? And weren't you also the one who wanted to prevent as many explosions as possible?"</p><p>"That was before we were this close to getting to our goal. I've also thought this through. You charge in and set off as many traps, Kotori gets frightened and abandons her post or disables some of the other traps, and then it becomes easier to maneuver."</p><p>"And if people get pissed off?" Naruto asked, not wanting to have to be chased around by pissed off shinobi.</p><p>"We blame it on Akahana," Izo smirked. Akahana, who had been nodding in agreement with Izo the entire time, shot him a nasty look.</p><p>"Or you can say it was all Izo's idea," she added. "He can afford to be in trouble with the Soshikage."</p><p>"All right," Naruto reluctantly agreed and prepared to make his shadow clones.</p><p>"Wait!"</p><p>The four turned at the sudden shout. Izo had his bow drawn and an arrow ready to fly in the second it took to turn.</p><p>Another shinobi was jogging toward them. He looked to be more about Naruto's age instead of Akahana's age. His hair was a dark brown and was shaggily cut, giving him a scruffy and wild appearance.</p><p>"What do you want, Atsuo?" Akahana's voice was sharp and irritated. "We're still playing."</p><p>"We're finished now," the younger boy replied. "We need your team. There's been another incident."</p><p>Yuri stiffened.</p><p>"Why is the entire team needed?" she asked. "Why am I even needed? Surely the hospital has enough competent healers that I'm not needed at the moment."</p><p>Atsuo looked grim.</p><p>"The shinobi in question was already dead when found. He was found inside the cat clan estate."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>I hope you enjoyed this chapter and please review!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><p>Back with the newest installment! Enjoy!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto was all but forgotten as his teammates followed the messenger. He trailed behind them, feeling out of place.</p><p>Akahana's hands were clenched into fists at her sides. They were trembling ever so slightly. She stopped suddenly. Izo and Yuri glanced back at her. A confused look crossed Yuri's face.</p><p>"Akahana, what's wrong?" she asked quietly. Akahana glowered at the messenger who was giving her an impatient look.</p><p>"Who was murdered?" she asked.</p><p>"A shinobi," the messenger replied.</p><p>"Of what clan?" Akahana demanded. "If it's someone from outside of the cat clan, I'm not going to bother going. I'm not dealing with the accusations."</p><p>"Does it really matter what clan?" Yuri snapped. "They were found on our territory and we have a right to know."</p><p>"Know what? Which one of us will be questioned? Which one of us will be blamed? Or maybe it was a member of the cat clan. Then we get to find out which one of us lost a family member." Akahana sounded bitter as she glared at Yuri and the messenger.</p><p>"I don't know the details," the messenger said. "I was told to gather all the teams up that have shinobi belonging to the cat clan in them."</p><p>"I'm not going then," Akahana said determinedly. Izo gave her a warning look. Akahana snarled at him. "I'm not entering into any situation where I don't know all the details. Not after what happened last time."</p><p>Naruto's head tilted to the side at that comment. Last time?</p><p>"Then you can answer to the Soshikage," Izo warned and gestured for the messenger to move on. The messenger, Izo, and Yuri soon disappeared from sight.</p><p>"I'm so scared," Akahana muttered under her breath as they departed.</p><p>"What happened last time?" Naruto asked hesitantly after a few seconds of silence. Akahana glanced at him.</p><p>"The last time someone from my immediate family went into something without knowing all the details, he never came back," she said softly. "No body was ever retrieved."</p><p>"And since then, all your missions have included every single detail that you've needed?" Naruto asked, disbelief coloring his voice.</p><p>"No, but I haven't gone on the ones that haven't had every detail," Akahana said lightly.</p><p>"That's so cowardly!" Naruto broke out. Akahana spun to face him with a hiss, a hand going into her kunai pouch. "As a shinobi, you can't know everything! To do nothing when you aren't sure of what to do is the coward's way out!"</p><p>"Maybe to you it is but in my world, it's the smartest choice. Here, you always have to be careful with what you do and say. If you aren't, then someone gets offended and blood feuds break out."</p><p>"I'm surprised that hasn't happened yet," Naruto commented. Akahana relaxed enough to give a small shrug.</p><p>"It's a fine line," she agreed. "I wake up every morning wondering when the war will start. Any idiot could see that war is about to break out—even an idiot like you."</p><p>Naruto had been about to say something in agreement but at her last comment, his jaw just hung open.</p><p>"Huh?" he said. Akahana rolled her eyes and didn't say anything.</p><p>"So has it been this way your entire life?" Naruto asked. Akahana shook her head.</p><p>"It wasn't when I was a kid," she stated. "The clans actually got along to some extent back then. The year Yuri, Izo, and I became a shinobi is when things started getting bad. The old Soshikage died and the current one took her place. It wasn't a popular decision. Lately it's gotten even worse because of all the killings. Everyone believes everyone else is the killer. It's not exactly an ideal environment to live in."</p><p>Akahana made a face. Naruto wasn't sure what to say. He couldn't exactly encourage her to leave her home if she was unhappy. No shinobi was ever awarded that privilege. To do so would mark her as a traitor. The only way Akahana would ever be given an out is if she died or if the village was destroyed to the point where it would no longer exist.</p><p>"Shinobi are people bred for war," Akahana continued after a little bit. "Our shinobi especially. Other villages used to hire us when they wanted to win a battle with few casualties. Since we're so connected with our animal counterparts, most of the other villages thought of it as a two-for-one deal. Then we were hired to slaughter villages and win land for countries that were looking to expand or that wanted to eliminate competition. Soon every village hired us so we often found ourselves going into battle against family members.</p><p>"It didn't take long for the Council to figure out that there was a problem and make a decision. We faked our destruction, planted the forest around us, and were forbidden to leave the haven of our village. It was the last thing that the Council fully agreed on."</p><p>Akahana's voice turned bitter.</p><p>"What would happen if someone tried to leave?" Naruto asked. After all, he would have to leave at some point. Otherwise he would be declared a missing nin and he wasn't going to follow into Sasuke's path.</p><p>"Our network is too tightly strung," Akahana mentioned. "The Council would know within the hour and teams would be sent out to retrieve the one who left. Most who have tried to leave kill themselves once they realize that the village is after them. We don't take well to traitors."</p><p>Akahana glanced at Naruto.</p><p>"When the Council decided to put you onto a team, you became a shinobi of this village," she informed him. "Not a trusted one, but a shinobi nonetheless. You're in this for life, just like me."</p><p>It wasn't until Naruto was locked back up in the fox clan estate home that he fully realized what had happened. Akahana had been trying to warn him about something. Something that she was scared of.</p><p>Akahana, in a way, reminded Naruto of Tsunade. Both were strong, powerful women. Tsunade was afraid of few things in life. Naruto had a feeling the same went for Akahana.</p><p>Akahana was scared of something.</p><p>Naruto needed to find out what it was that terrified her.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Review please!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><p>Enjoy this newest installment! I just got tons of inspiration for this story so there should be a few more updates on the way within the next few weeks. To move things along, I decided to skip forward a few weeks because if I didn't, there would have just been a lot of nonsense.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>A few weeks later</i></p><p>Naruto narrowly dodged the punch aimed for his face and swung around to avoid the kick coming at him from the side. Then he had to promptly duck as a large cat sprang at him. He felt the extended claws brush over his hair. That one was close. Hotaru's claws could have easily ripped his face apart had she jumped lower.</p><p>"You're still slow," Akahana called as she retreated from the close range. Naruto sent a glare in her direction.</p><p>"I'm still slow?" he remarked, incredulous. "I'm still slow?"</p><p>"Compared to Akahana, you are," Izo interjected from where he was watching the practice spar. Naruto scowled.</p><p>"Compared to her, everyone's slow," he snapped. "I know for a fact that I can outrun and duck faster than most of the teams in the village."</p><p>"He has a point," Yuri agreed, stashing the senbon she had been practicing with in a pouch hanging off her waist. "When he got here, even toddlers were faster than him."</p><p>Naruto's scowl turned her direction.</p><p>"That's not true!" he protested. Yuri smirked and shrugged.</p><p>"What I'm trying to say is that he's made progress," she further explained.</p><p>"Only because Akahana and the shinobi she's recruited have been springing surprise attacks on him whenever possible," Izo commented. Naruto huffed.</p><p>"The desperation in the way he tries is adorable, I think," Hotaru purred as she padded to stand aside Akahana. Naruto resisted the urge to shudder. He could normally put up with Hotaru (he was one of the few that wasn't scared of the hellcat), but there were some moments like this one when he found her unbearably creepy. Akahana smirked down at her feline counterpart.</p><p>"Are we done with this for now?" she asked Izo. "Or can I continue beating him to a pulp?"</p><p>Izo stared at her with emotionless eyes.</p><p>"Go practice your jutsus," he ordered. "Naruto, you have a choice for once—memorizing trap plans or trying to bring Kyuubi out of you."</p><p>That wasn't a real choice, in Naruto's opinion. He knew which one Izo wanted him to pick and he knew that he would only be successful at one.</p><p>"Hand over the scrolls," he grumbled, holding out his hand. Akahana snorted, having predicted his choice. Yuri looked disappointed as Izo passed over the back lying against one of the training posts. Naruto pulled out one of the scrolls, holding back a sigh as he opened it.</p><p>It was no secret that the rest of his teammates wanted Naruto to try and break the seal on his body, extracting Kyuubi in the process. However, it was a feat that was near impossible. Normally, that would never stop Naruto from trying and succeeding, but the blonde was reluctant to extract Kyuubi from his body. After all, once the fox was freed, what would prevent the village from killing him and bonding Kyuubi with another member of the fox clan?</p><p>So, Naruto would try but every time he got close to actually breaking the seal, he would claim fatigue or pain and dash away before Yuri could examine him.</p><p>Naruto made the necessary seal and five Kage Bunshin popped into existence.</p><p>"You know what to do," Naruto ordered brightly and his clones promptly grabbed the rest of the scrolls from the pack. Izo moved away, beckoning Yuri to follow him.</p><p>"Let's see what you can do," he ordered. Yuri nodded and their spar began. Naruto blocked them out, only sparing the least amount of attention needed to ensure that a jutsu didn't come in his direction or that a shuriken didn't fly at him, missing his head by scant centimeters. Like one had last week…Naruto looked up from his scroll and glared at Akahana, who was surrounded by rapidly spinning cyclones of fire. She ignored his glare and lifted her hands. The cyclones rose off the ground. It looked easy but Naruto could see the glimmer of sweat on Akahana's brow and the intense glimmer of concentration in her eye.</p><p>Akahana pushed her hands out and the cyclones spun outwards, racing away from her. However, before they could light the surrounding trees and training grounds on fire, Hotaru leapt after them. A few bats with her large paws and the twisters changed directions. Once she got bored of playing with a certain twister, Hotaru would sink her teeth into the tail of it, making the fiery tornadoes explode into tiny fragments and sparks.</p><p>Once they were all gone, Hotaru returned to Akahana, who grinned down at her.</p><p>"Are there more?" Naruto heard Hotaru ask the kunoichi. Akahana's grin turned into a frown.</p><p>"I gave you nine," she informed the hellcat. "That's more than I've managed in the past."</p><p>"The last one could manage up to sixteen," Hotaru mewed in a snide voice.</p><p>"The last shinobi you worked with was a Soshikage," Akahana replied. "I don't have those chakra reserves yet."</p><p>Naruto turned back to his scroll, not wanting to overhear this particular conversation. It seemed too private.</p><p>After a few hours, Naruto's Kage Bunshin popped one by one once their task was completed. Naruto had been accustomed to the influx of information he received once they popped and was able to continue memorizing his own with even batting an eye. After the last one had popped and Naruto's own scroll was memorized, he found himself being stared down by Izo.</p><p>"What?" he asked as he got to his feet. The other boy shook his head.</p><p>"Nothing," he replied. "Go home."</p><p>Naruto instinctively bristled at the direct order. He looked at the sky. The sun hadn't even begun to set yet, which was their normal cue to go home. Izo turned away from Naruto.</p><p>"You too, Akahana," he called over to the red-haired shinobi. She looked at the squad leader in confusion.</p><p>"So soon?" she asked. Izo nodded.</p><p>"It's that time," he pointed out. "I expect that sometime this week all the shinobi teams will be called in by the Soshikage. Once that happens, we have two weeks of intensive training before…"</p><p>Izo trailed off. Akahana's eyes widened and she nodded. Naruto stared at the pair in confusion.</p><p>"Has it been two years already?" she mused. "It hasn't felt like it."</p><p>"It's felt longer to me," Yuri murmured.</p><p>"What are you talking about?" Naruto burst in to the conversation. The three members of the cat clan stared at him blankly.</p><p>"The Day of Trials," Yuri explained after a few seconds. "It serves a variety of purposes."</p><p>"Such as?" Naruto prodded.</p><p>"It allows shinobi to advance in the ranks," Yuri explained. "If you get far enough in the competitions, then you get promoted."</p><p>"Like the chuunin exams?" Naruto asked. The three stared at him blankly. Naruto's cheeks reddened.</p><p>"Never mind," he muttered. "What else?"</p><p>"Actual trials. The clan heads select a shinobi from their clan to represent them and the representatives battle it out in the trials. It's a way to settle what could become future blood feuds. And then there's the challenge…"</p><p>Akahana and Izo smirked. It was odd seeing a smirk on Izo's normally impassive face.</p><p>"The challenge?" Naruto asked skeptically.</p><p>"The strongest shinobi of the clans participate in the challenge. It's an elimination type tournament. Two shinobi pair off and battle each other. The winner advances. The battles take place until there's only one shinobi left. The winner's clan head becomes the Soshikage and a new clan head is elected while he or she remains as Soshikage," Izo explained.</p><p>"So, theoretically, the Soshikage represents the strongest clan in the village," Akahana added.</p><p>"But not the strongest shinobi," Naruto muttered to himself. It was a very different system than the one Konoha had.</p><p>"The clan head is the strongest shinobi in the clan," Yuri reminded Naruto. "Anyways, once the Soshikage makes the announcement of when the Day of Trials will be, all the teams and clans start intensive training routines."</p><p>"This all takes place in a day?" Naruto asked doubtfully. It seemed like there was too much going on for everything to happen in just one day.</p><p>"When there were less clans and shinobi, it did. Now, it's more of a week," Yuri said. She was about to say something more but was cut off by a hiss from Akahana.</p><p>"Wolf team incoming," the kunoichi muttered as everyone looked at her. "Let's scatter before they try and rope us into playing a game."</p><p>The path back to the fox clan home was nearly second nature to Naruto after the past few weeks. When he arrived at the home, he could recognize a few of the shinobi lingering about. The blonde waved at everyone he passed, giving them a bright smile. He saved his brightest smiles for the few children playing in the courtyard.</p><p>"Naruto-san!" a small girl waved him over. She was only three or four years old. "Look what I can do!"</p><p>She grabbed a practice kunai from the pile lying beside her and threw it at the target that had been set up a few meters away. It hit the target nearly dead center, point in, and stuck. Naruto clapped.</p><p>"You've been practicing, Kouzan," he praised her, ruffling her orange hair. "Keep it up and you may be as amazing as me some day!"</p><p>Kouzan beamed.</p><p>"I want to be Soshikage!" she informed him. "I can't wait until I can start taking part in the Day of Trials."</p><p>Naruto's smile became slightly forced.</p><p>"You will soon," he told her. "But you need a bit more practice until you can."</p><p>Kouzan nodded.</p><p>"I'll practice as hard as I can," she promised as Naruto stood up. Leaving Kouzan, Naruto headed back to the room that had been marked as his for the time being. Once Naruto entered and the door was closed, he set his weapons pouch aside and sat on the bed. He was all for relaxing and taking a nap but a croak drew his attention.</p><p>A small toad sat on his pillow. Naruto grinned, recognizing the toad.</p><p>"The Pervy-sage wrote back already?" he asked it. He had become used to toads showing up in his room by now. He had become used to a lot of things.</p><p>"Yep," the small toad replied and stuck out its tongue. Resting on it was a note from Jiraiya. These notes were Naruto's only connection to the outside world. Naruto had been shocked when the first toad had appeared, bearing a message from his sensei, but then he realized the genius behind it. At first, upon hearing of the situation, the sannin had been prepared to go in and rescue Naruto but the barrier around the village prevented him from getting through. Naruto supposed he could have snuck out but something was compelling him to stay. However, he couldn't quite figure out what that compelling force was. Maybe it was the fact that he actually had a biological family here. The people here were cut from the same cloth as him.</p><p>Naruto opened the note and scanned it, easily reading Jiraiya's sloppy handwriting from months of practice.</p><p><i>I've taken residence in a village nearby under the guise of doing research on the forest and its history. People are skeptical but seem to content to let me be as long as I don't actually go into the forest. If anything happens, and it seems from your notes that something will soon, send a toad. I'll help in whatever way I can to get you out of there. That being said, have you learned anything more? I did some research about the village but there's next to nothing. As soon as we move on, I propose looking into it in the library of a different shinobi village. There has to be records. They can't have destroyed them all. How's the new team? How's that pretty redhead you mentioned?</i></p><p>Naruto rolled his eyes. Of course the Pervy-sage would inquire into Akahana. Any mention of a woman and he was hooked.</p><p>Naruto flipped over the note and pulled out a brush and ink. He wrote quickly.</p><p><i>In training today, they mentioned something about the "Day of Trials". From their explanation, it sounds like the Chuunin Exams. It'll take place in a few weeks. If I passed this, could I be considered a Chuunin? Judging by the training I've gone through, I have a feeling it will be much tougher than the one Konoha hosted. I don't know whether or not I'll be taking place in the actual tournaments, but it sounds like all shinobi take part in it. My team is still making me try and break Kyuubi's seal. The clan leaders are as well. So far, it's been unsuccessful but that's only because I haven't been trying. I know what I can do with Kyuubi's chakra. I don't want to imagine what would actually happen if he was released. Plus, once he's released, what would keep me alive? I'm more accepted now but I still see the distrusting looks and the glares.</i></p><p>Naruto folded the note and handed it over to the waiting toad. The toad swallowed it and turned away from Naruto.</p><p>"See you later, boss," it called over its shoulder as it disappeared from sight. Naruto watched it go with a slight longing. However, he didn't have much time to mull over Jiraiya and the toads as someone knocked on his door. Naruto opened the door to reveal Hisano standing on the other side, a severe look on her face.</p><p>"Michio and I wish to talk to you," she said.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Review please!

<br><br><h3>Chapter 10</h3><hr><br><p>Enjoy this next installment! Things have been starting to progress quickly with this story now. I don't know why. Maybe it's because things are heating up between Naruto and the village or maybe it's because I'm starting to plan the sequel. Either way...Enjoy!</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto followed Hisano to the private study that both Michio and Hisano used on a daily basis. He was slightly confused. Why did they want to talk to him?</p><p>Michio was already in the study, waiting for the pair. Hisano walked over to where he was sitting and knelt beside him. Her husband gestured for Naruto to kneel across the table from him.</p><p>"What's going on?" Naruto demanded as he did so. The pair traded looks and Hisano gestured for Michio to take the lead on this one.</p><p>"We heard that your team explained the Day of Trials to you today," he began.</p><p>"How did you find that out?" Naruto interrupted. "There was no one at the training area but us."</p><p>"We have our ways, brat," Hisano replied snappily. "Don't interrupt anymore until we finish. It's not polite."</p><p>Hisano had been trying to drill manners into Naruto for the past few weeks. It wasn't really a successful endeavor so far. Naruto was far too hasty and impatient.</p><p>"Since they've explained that to you," Michio continued, "we have talked and decided that you should be better prepared for when you perform on that day."</p><p>"Perform?" Naruto asked, the words out of his mouth before he could stop them. Hisano scowled at him and Naruto grinned sheepishly at him.</p><p>"Yes," Michio replied. "Every active shinobi that is on a permanent team takes part. Therefore, we've decided that you need more tools that you can use to prove that the fox clan is a clan that won't be pushed around anymore."</p><p>"Tools?" Naruto asked suspiciously. "What sort of tools?" He hoped they weren't talking about Kyuubi but he doubted it. If they had known what his team had talked about today during practice, then they must know that he hadn't succeeded with the extraction yet.</p><p>"Since you can't access the fox inside you," Michio began, "and it is considered disgraceful for a shinobi not to be able to use his clan's techniques—"</p><p>Naruto made a face at that.</p><p>"So we have decided that it is time for you to receive our clan's contract," Michio finished. Naruto looked at the older man.</p><p>"Contract? Like a summoning contract?" he asked eagerly. He already had the contract for the toads. Was it possible to have two?</p><p>Michio nodded curtly.</p><p>"Yes, the contract of the foxes," he said, pulling out a scroll from the inside of his sleeve. Naruto stared at it in unabashed amazement and eagerness. "All you need to do is—"</p><p>"Sign my name with my blood," Naruto finished. The older pair of shinobi looked surprised that he knew that fact and Naruto realized he probably shouldn't have said anything. He laughed awkwardly and Hisano gave a sigh. She shook her head at her husband, giving him a signal that he shouldn't ask about it. The less they knew, the less trouble they could get in with the other clans if the boy had another contract. After all, if they hadn't known, how could they be held responsible?</p><p>Michio handed over the scroll.</p><p>"Once it's signed, summon just one of the smaller foxes," he ordered. Naruto nodded. He unrolled the small, worn scroll and bit his thumb. The blood welled up and Naruto carefully signed his name. The list of names on the scroll was extensive. His eyes roamed over the list, resting on three familiar names. Uzu Michio. Maki Hisano. Uzumaki Kushina. There was so much history in this scroll. Naruto could easily guess that every single shinobi of the fox clan was listed here. Not only was it a technique but also it was the clan's way of keeping records of the shinobi in their clan.</p><p>Once his name was signed and the blood was drying, Naruto began forming his hands into the seals needed. Boar. Dog. Bird. Monkey. Ram. Naruto thrust his hand onto the ground and pushed out a moderate amount of chakra. There was a poof of smoke and once it cleared, an average size fox stood where Naruto had placed his hand on the ground.</p><p>The reddish orange fox's nose twitched as it sniffed the air and looked around. Then its tail wagged ever so slightly.</p><p>"Who're you?" it demanded in a feminine voice to Naruto. Hisano and Michio smiled. There was hope for the boy after all.</p><p>"Uzumaki Naruto. What's your name, fox-sama?" Naruto asked, mimicking the way he had heard Yuri talk to the cats she often had hanging around her. The fox sniffed again. Her nose quivered and she stared at Naruto suspiciously.</p><p>"Suzu," she replied. "Why do you smell of Kurama?"</p><p>"Kurama?" Naruto asked. He didn't recognize the name.</p><p>"The name of the fox with nine tails," Suzu growled out. "You reek of him. Us foxes are wondering why he has not come home in quite some time."</p><p>"It's complicated," Naruto mumbled. "But I'm working on it."</p><p>Suzu nodded and began padding around the room.</p><p>"Am I needed for anything?" she asked. Hisano shook her head.</p><p>"No, Suzu-sama. We have just given Naruto-kun the contract and were testing the connection. You may go back if you wish," she said. Suzu nodded and looked at Naruto once again.</p><p>"I'll tell the others that Kurama has been found," she told him. "You should work on summoning us all. I'm sure they'll have questions."</p><p>There was another poof of smoke before Naruto could reply. Naruto sighed as it cleared. Suzu was gone.</p><p>"Is that all?" he asked the two older shinobi. Hisano smiled grimly.</p><p>"The foxes will teach you the rest," she replied cryptically. Naruto inclined his head and turned, leaving the study and the other two shinobi behind. His eyes narrowed slightly as he followed the path back to his room. Kurama, huh? It had never occurred to him that the Kyuubi would actually have a name. He had always thought of the nine-tailed fox as the Kyuubi, a demon that took the form of a fox. Knowing that it was called Kurama made the Kyuubi seem less demonic.</p><p>A demon fox that didn't seem demonic? It was laughable. Kyuubi, Kurama, whatever it was called, was dangerous. He wanted to kill and disliked humans. That had been clear from the few conversations Naruto had had with the fox. Naruto was fairly positive that if he ever let the nine-tailed fox out of his body that he would be killed immediately, either by other shinobi or by Kyuubi himself.</p><p>Naruto sighed. He needed advice on what to do but he didn't know who to go to. He doubted that any of the fox clan members had ever experienced this sort of problem and he really didn't trust the other clans.</p><p>Naruto sat on the edge of his bed, staring blankly at the wall. Who could he ask? He supposed he could go to his teammates but he had a feeling Yuri would be too technical about it and that Izo wouldn't have anything to offer. Naruto had never even seen Izo with a cat or summon a cat.</p><p>Naruto groaned as the obvious solution came to mind. Akahana and Hotaru. Hotaru was a hellcat, or so Naruto had been told. He hadn't quite understood how that made her different from the cats that Yuri summoned and used but now it was crystal clear. Hotaru was most likely the feline form of Kyuubi.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Please review! The next chapter should be up sometime between the 18 and 21 of this month.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 11</h3><hr><br><p>Hey all! Enjoy this newest installment! I'm currently taking a break from NaNo writing to post this (for anyone who's curious, I'm 45,003 words in. 5,000 more to go!)</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Akahana was still at the training grounds when Naruto found her. It was the first place he looked and, thankfully, it was the only place he had to look. She was breathing heavily and glaring at Hotaru, who was purring and licking a paw. Beads of sweat covered her forehead.</p><p>"Are you going to continue?" Hotaru asked. Akahana stood up straight, a determined glint in her eye.</p><p>"Of course," she panted. "I'll get this jutsu down. If I can't, then I don't deserve to be chosen by the hellcats."</p><p>The seals Akahana made were formed too fast for Naruto to discern.</p><p>"Fire Style: Blizzard of Flames!" Akahana cried as she formed the final seal. Naruto waited for the jutsu to take effect. A small circle of sparks formed around Akahana but they soon faded. Hotaru snorted and Akahana grimaced.</p><p>"What's that jutsu supposed to do?" Naruto asked. Akahana spun around, hand reflexively pulling out a kunai. She relaxed slightly upon seeing Naruto but didn't look happy to see him. She also didn't put away the kunai, choosing to twirl it around her fingers lazily.</p><p>"What do you want?" she demanded warily.</p><p>"I have some questions," Naruto said. Akahana's eyes narrowed. She could tell that Naruto was being very serious, something that was rare with the boy. He wasn't smiling and it gave his face a severe look.</p><p>"Why do you think I can answer them?" she asked.</p><p>"Because you work with Hotaru-san," Naruto replied, nodding in Hotaru's direction. The hellcat perked up at her name.</p><p>"Does it have to do with the demon fox?" she asked. Naruto nodded.</p><p>"What do you know of him?" he asked.</p><p>"Not much," Hotaru responded. "He's older than me. We used to roam different areas of the earth before we bonded with shinobi. He's a bit insane, but then again, all creatures that have walked the underworld are."</p><p>"Underworld?" Naruto questioned. Akahana rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Did you honestly think that Hotaru was a regular cat?" she asked snidely. "She's called a hellcat for a reason."</p><p>"I guard the entrances and exits to the underworld when I'm not in the village," Hotaru explained. "It's the place where the souls of shinobi go when they die."</p><p>There were so many questions Naruto wanted to ask but very few were relevant to his dilemma. However, he wasn't sure how to phrase it delicately. Delicacy had never been his strong point.</p><p>"What happens if I manage to release the Kyuubi?" he asked.</p><p>"You get applause?" Akahana remarked, not sure where the boy was going with this. "A pat on the back for a job well done?"</p><p>"So he won't try to kill me? Or no one else will so they can control Kyuubi?" Naruto asked. Akahana gave Naruto a strange look for a few seconds before she broke out into giggles.</p><p>"You don't have to worry about your clan members killing you," she explained. "None of them will want to work with Kyuubi, even if they could. Your bond with the fox is too strong, no matter how much he hates you, and none of them have the strength and determination you have. You're the only shinobi of the fox clan that can work with him as of right now. And, for the record, don't talk about controlling Kyuubi. You work <i>with</i> him. You don't <i>control</i> him. There's a difference."</p><p>"And what about Kyuubi trying to kill me?" Naruto asked. "I have no reason to believe that he won't. He hates humans."</p><p>"I hate humans," Hotaru interjected. "But I haven't killed the redhead yet. And I won't. I've grown up with Akahana just like Kyuubi has grown up with you. Like Akahana said, there's a bond between you two, a bond that prevents the demon fox from killing you."</p><p>"If it makes you feel any better, Hotaru tried to kill me the first time I worked with her until she realized that we were bonded," Akahana added. "Is that all you were worried about? I know our village doesn't make the best impression and is obsessed with power plays but we're not stupid enough to kill you just to gain some control. It's too obvious."</p><p>"Thanks…"Naruto mumbled. Akahana gave him a tiny grin.</p><p>"So are you going to start trying harder now?" she asked. "It was obvious to us all that you weren't really trying. Subtlety isn't really your specialty, you know."</p><p>"I know," Naruto admitted. "But that's what makes me the most unpredictable ninja!"</p><p>Akahana rolled her eyes and finally decided to stash her kunai away. She glanced at Hotaru, who bared her teeth in a sort of grin.</p><p>"Are we still practicing?" the hellcat asked. "You haven't given up yet?"</p><p>"I'll see you later," Akahana told Naruto, not taking her gaze away from Hotaru.</p><p>"You never answered my first question, though," Naruto pointed out.</p><p>"Oh?" Akahana asked, beginning to form the pattern of seals again.</p><p>"What was that jutsu supposed to do?" Naruto asked again.</p><p>"Fire Style: Blizzard of Flames!" Akahana cried as she finished the sequence. This time, instead of a small circle of sparks, there was a flurry of flames that spun through the air, swirling around Akahana.</p><p>"Something to that extent," she said once the last of the flames had faded. "Only much larger. Only the best can master this jutsu."</p><p>Hotaru snorted.</p><p>"You're nowhere near the best," she informed Akahana scathingly. "You need lots more practice."</p><p>The hellcat looked over at Naruto.</p><p>"What are you waiting for?" she wondered. "Get to it."</p><p>"Get to what?" Naruto questioned. Hotaru growled.</p><p>"I don't care. Work on extracting the Kyuubi or work on your jutsu. Just make sure you're doing something," she ordered. Naruto gave her a disbelieving look and when Hotaru ignored it, he turned his gaze on Akahana, who shrugged.</p><p>"It's always easiest to do as she says," she told Naruto before she resumed training. Naruto sighed. He might as well, considering he was already at the training grounds.</p><p>Naruto sank down to the ground so that he was sitting with his legs crossed. His blue eyes closed as he took deep breaths, trying to find the cage Kyuubi was sealed inside.</p><p>It felt like Naruto was sitting for hours before he finally got to the place he was looking for. In the distance he could hear the fox inside him growling.</p><p>Naruto walked along the damp sewer, ignoring the water droplets falling to the ground and creating eerie splashes against the stone. The further he walked along, the louder the fox's growls grew. Eventually the looming barred gates came into sight.</p><p>Naruto gazed up at them. It was such a large prison. Kyuubi snarled from behind his bars.</p><p>"You're not dying or severely injured," the demon fox pointed out. Naruto inclined his head.</p><p>"This is the first time you've come to me without needing me to live," the fox continued. Naruto stared into the large red eyes.</p><p>"I've recently discovered some things," he said. "About your past."</p><p>"So?" the fox demanded angrily.</p><p>"I'm currently in the Village Hidden by the Animals," Naruto stated. Kyuubi glared down at the boy. That was impossible.</p><p>"That village was destroyed long ago," the fox growled out. Naruto shook his head.</p><p>"It was just hidden away," he disagreed. "I've been taken in and put on a shinobi team. They've been trying to get me to bring you out of my body."</p><p>The demon fox snorted.</p><p>"If it was possible," he informed the boy, "I would have left long ago."</p><p>"But I wasn't willing before," Naruto replied. "I'll gladly break the seal now if you promise not to kill me once you're free."</p><p>The large demon fox paced in his prison as much as he could. Naruto had never seen the fox move so much.</p><p>"Fine," Kyuubi agreed reluctantly. "I won't kill you."</p><p>Naruto reached for the seal, prepared to pull it off. However, as his fingers brushed over the corner of the seal, a barrier of chakra emerged, creating a barrier around the seal. Despite numerous tries, Naruto's hand could not pass through the chakra barrier.</p><p>He scowled at it.</p><p>"I should have known…"Kyuubi growled to himself. "That man would have placed precautions to make sure that you could never release me."</p><p>Naruto's scowl deepened and he resumed trying.</p><p>Hours later, Naruto had made no progress. The barrier around the seal held firm and strong. It was one of the most frustrating things Naruto had ever encountered. He kicked at one of the sewer walls and the sound that came from the force of his kick echoed down the long hallway.</p><p>"Try later," Kyuubi encouraged. Naruto had noticed that the fox was much more polite when he felt like he would benefit. It was a nice change from the normal threats and growls he received. "When you're not so tired."</p><p>Naruto nodded.</p><p>"Tomorrow," he promised before leaving the sewer.</p><p>It was dark when Naruto opened his blue eyes. It had been hours since he had retreated into himself. Akahana was still there, to his surprise, still training. She looked exhausted but Naruto recognized the expression on her face. She wasn't going to give up until she had successfully learned that jutsu.</p><p>Naruto wanted to comment but decided it was best not to. Instead, he left the training ground silently, ignorant of the eyes that watched him go.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>A woman hiccupped through her sobs in the corner of the room before she pressed an arm to her mouth. She mustn't make a sound. The intruder might hear her.</p><p>It was too late. The intruder heard her and the movement of her arm allowed the killer to pinpoint her location. Quietly, the lithe form approached. The sobbing woman pressed herself against the wall, unable to go anywhere else.</p><p>"Why?" she asked as the murdered loomed over her. Cold eyes stared mercilessly down at her.</p><p>"Because you're weak. You're clan was weak," came a cruel drawl. "And because I get what I want. By your deaths, I'll get what I want."</p><p>"What's that? Blood? Bodies for you to devour? I know your kind. I've seen how much you love devouring your victims," the crying woman spat.</p><p>The cruel, high-pitched laugh chilled the air.</p><p>"No, my darling," the snake-like woman replied softly, tracing a thin finger down the crying woman's face. The trapped kunoichi shuddered. "The destruction of the village."</p><p>Then she struck.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>I hope you enjoyed and I'll hopefully have a new chapter soon (provided Doctor Who doesn't distract me). Please review!</p>
