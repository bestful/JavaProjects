Naruto had a lot on his mind this night. Naruto decided to go for a walk through the park to clear his head a little. You see while he didn't hate the village he didn't like it either the hateful stares kinda got to you after a while. This is why he only walks outside at night. No hate no fear just peace even an idiot like him could identify .</p><p>Naruto loved it when he didn't feel like he would have to run like hell at a moments notice. that's when he heard it. A growl from his left he quickly whipped around to see a extremely freaky sight. It looked like a wolf with hands and standing on two legs. (can we take a guess class.) naruto was about to run when the creature attacked swiping its clawed hand at his chest. Naruto back flipped to avoid it only to have his foot caught by those impressive jaws. The creature then proceeded to shake him till it released his foot and sent him into a nearby tree. Naruto quickly jumped back to his feet only to collapse when his left foot touched the ground. It was torn to ribbons 'a hell this is not good' naruto thought. The creature wasted no time in attacking again seeing that naruto was crippled. Naruto quickly formed his favorite jutsu and replaced himself with a clone and jumped into the tree using only his right foot. The creature sank its teeth into the poor clones neck.</p><p>The instant it did that the real naruto threw a kunai into the back of the creatures head. The creature collapsed and this is were it got weird the creature changed into a human. Now naruto being naruto thought it was a henge at first till he saw the man was wearing absolutely nothing except a few tattered peaces of cloth. Which suggested that his clothes were ripped off. Also the way he changed back told him that it was no henge this person had in fact turned into that beastly wolf human hybrid. (hey naruto actually used the word hybrid in the proper context lol). Naruto was beat and this little fight hadn't helped much so his only real thought was 'fuck this I'm going home to take a nap then report this to the hokage'. naruto decided that the branch he was in was a good enough bed so he was about to relax when he remembered a ninjas objective was stealth and not to be detected so naruto destroyed the body right there. He then reclined and fell asleep.</p><p>Naruto found himself in a dark dank sewer that was his mindscape. He heard a distant clanging of metal and headed for it. He was walking for a good ten minutes when he came to a big room that was a couple stories tall. At one end of the room was a giant cage in which he saw… "kyuubi you're the kyuubi holy shit I don't know weather to be excited or horrified can you teach…" Naruto didn't get any further cause the kyuubi roared</p><p>"<b>SILENCE YOU PUNNY MORTAL DO YOU RELISE THE GIFT YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN BEING BITTEN BY A WERE WOLF. OF COURSE YOU DON'T WELL ILL GIVE YOU A GIFT OF MY OWN IF YOU STOP WEREING ORANGE AND START WEREING BLACK." </b>the kyuubi stated. Naruto gained a thoughtful expression and then nodded his head vigorously. The kyuubi smirked "<b>THAN HEARS YOUR GIFT YOU CAN NOW CHANGED BETWEEN HUMAN WOLF AND HYBRID LIKE THE PERSON THAT ATTACKED YOU UNDERSTAND" </b>naruto nodded again. "<b>GOOD NOW TIME TO WAKE UP KITLING"</b> the next thing naruto new he was being surrounded by red chakera and he then saw the sun glairing at him. He stood and noticed that his foot was no longer torn to bits. Suddenly a ton of information popped into his head he new everything about being a lycanthrope he had enhanced strength speed senses and intelligence. His skin was tougher It could take a kunai and not be pierced. Naruto also knew how to controlle the change oh yes this was going to be fun. "sasuke get ready to get your ass kicked hell yeah."</p><p>END CHAPTER</p><p>Hope you all like please no flames ok bye-bye then peace I'm outie</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p>A.n. hey thanx for all the nice reviews glad you all liked my story and to all you haters out there im disabling the anonymous review option sorry to those who don't have a account but wat eva kk now on wit the story</p><p><i><u><b>CHAPTER TWO: POOR SASUKE(NOT)</b></u></i></p><p>Naruto was almost giddy with anticipation. He and sasuke were to spar today and with his new strength speed and so on he would wipe the floor with the bastard. At the moment he was running to team sevens training field and dodging through the streets so fast that they couldn't see him. 'oh yes I'm so going to wipe that smug smirk off that idiots face and shut that stupid bitch up about her precious sasuke kun". Naruto was defiantly enjoying life.</p><p>Naruto approached the bridge where his team always met as usual sakura was the first one there. 'Stupid cherry bitch' out loud he said "Hey sakura chan where's sasuke". (oh how I hate her any one else share this hatred). Sakura just continued to watch for the bastard so naruto decided to go over his info on his lycanthrope blood now. 1 if he got too pissed he'd change into either his hybrid form or his full wolf. 2 he was now stronger and faster than gai-sensei or kakashi-sensei. 3 he also had an unlimited supply of chakera thanks to kyuubi and his wolf blood enhanced his natural reserves by tree times there normal amount. 4 his wolf blood also gave him a photographic memory. Thus he could copy almost any jutsu just by watching the seals being preformed. This was different from the sherigon because he had to guess on the amount of chakera to use. And finally 5 he could shift between wolf hybrid and human forms. Naruto would also heal all wounds instantly.</p><p>Just as he finished his new skill inventory sasuke and kakashi came walking up "yo" kakashi said as he approached the two on time shinobi. "YOUR LATE" sakura yelled and naruto just scowled at how loud she was which got them all worried when he didn't yell with her. Naruto turned and started walking towards the training grounds. "sasuke can we get your ass kicking over with". sasuke scowled at that comment but took his sparing place.</p><p>"ready start" kakashi said calmly sasuke tensed and got ready for naruto attack but naruto just stood there with his arms crossed waiting. Sasuke got tired of waiting so he charged and tried to kick naruto in the head only to hit air. "Behind you dip shit". sasuke's eyes widened when he heard naruto's voice but spun to punch the dobe in the face but again hit only air. Naruto seamed to appear next to sasuke and kicked him effortlessly sending the cold bastard into a nearby tree. The tree was smashed and broke in half. It then fell right on top of sasuke.</p><p>"that was pathetic sasuke next time I wont hold back." Naruto then turned to sakura. "Want to give the DOBE of the class a try or not." naruto smirked when he saw that bitch literally piss her pants. "what ever can we go or not kakashi-sensei or do we have a mission?" Naruto asked looking at the stunned kakashi just as sasuke managed to climb out of the rubble that was once a 50 foot tall tree. He charged in a fit of anger to try to hit Naruto only to get hit by a round house kick to the face sending him skidding across the ground.</p><p>"Naruto stop bea…" kakashi didn't get any further because his mouth was filled with fist. Naruto's fist to be exact.</p><p>"Kakashi are you so blind that you didn't see the attack he launched at me." Naruto said in a voice very much like a growl. " or is your precious sasuke's mental health more important than your other students. You don't deserve to be my sensei. The fourth would be ashamed that you played favorites like this."</p><p>As Naruto spoke kakashi felt his shame building. What was truly sad was he hadn't noticed any thing before naruto started to tell him what it was he was doing wrong. Kakashi nodded in acceptance. "I'm sorry naruto I didn't realize…"</p><p>"Of course you didn't realize you had your nose so far up sasuke's ass I'm surprised you could breath any thing but shit. Your lucky I got strong on my own or I would have died on the first c rank mission we had." naruto had to calm down so he took a couple deep breaths. After all he didn't want to change before it was time.</p><p>"kakashi just pay more attention from now one okay." kakashi nodded and turned to go gather up sasuke. Now that naruto looked at what had happened to the bastard he almost felt sorry. Almost.</p><p>"Oh we have our first c rank mission tomorrow so rest up. I'll bring sasuke to the hospital." Naruto turned to leave when he felt an object flying towards him. He was gone in an instant. Naruto quickly grabbed the object and twisted around to see sakura glaring at him</p><p>"Let go naruto. Don't you dare lay a…" naruto punched sakura in the face because he just couldn't stand that whining any longer.</p><p>"sakura if you ever try to touch me again I'll beat you within an inch of your pathetic existence. Understand bitch." naruto growled out he was done being every ones bitch.</p><p>"y…yes naruto san." He then turned away from her fuming all the way he went. Naruto headed home now disgusted with himself. He stopped at a clothing store on his way there and purchased a new set of clothes which consisted of a fishnet shirt and a black trench coat with the word fox on the back. He also bought a pair of black baggy pants with many pockets and holsters for all the tools he used naruto then let his hair which was actually quit long fall down he then tied his head protector around his shoulder.</p><p>All right lets get this mission done and over with.</p><p>An ok no flames k I got such nice reviews before lets keep up sound good I thought so too ok gotta love the fans bye bye</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p>A/N ok where was I now oh yea naruto had just gotten his new outfit god I hated that jump suit only because people kept teasing him for it. Ok now on with the story yay</p><p>disclaimer: I dont own naruto but I hope to change that soon lol.</p><p>CHAPTER THREE MISSON TO WAVE AND A SECRET NO MORE (DAMN)</p><p>Naruto awoke the next day bright and early so he could go train with a bunch of new jutsu he had made last night. He had to have come up with at least four new jutsu. The kyuubi said it was because his body was learning a lot of new things because of his little bite from that werewolf. Not only that but they where all in a strange language that he never new he knew. The really scary part was even the kyuubi couldn't explain that one away. Oh well he liked the language any way. (any fans play d&d cause I'm using draconic for the jutsu naruto designs kk). Naruto got dressed in the clothes he bought the other day. Naruto was wearing a fish net shirt black trench coat and black baggy pants that he bandaged near the bottom and tucked into his boots so they didn't trip him on a mission or whenever he was fighting. He attached his shiriken holster at mid thigh on his right leg. Naruto also left the front of the trench coat open. He then attached his head protector to his shoulder.</p><p>All in all Naruto thought he looked pretty damn good he'd keep this look defiantly. Naruto left it was four in the morning and headed to team sevens training ground. Naruto stood facing about 10 practice dummy's. naruto quickly preformed a set of three seals and shouted "<b><i>charir darastrix vaess svern no jutsu" </i></b>(red dragon arrow from above) just as naruto finished the jutsu a massive red flaming dragon shot down from the sky flew straight down and destroyed all 10 dummy's. naruto satisfied with the destruction got ready to do his next jutsu when he felt a person standing behind him. Naruto wiped around to se sakura staring like a retarded fish at the scene. Naruto smirked "What do you think the best thing is it cant be copied by the sherigon cause it needs a special gene in you that only a few people have." Sakura just continued to stare so naruto got back into position.</p><p>Naruto started a longer set of seals at least 10. "<b><i>thul gixustrat no jutsu" </i></b>(fashionable disemboweling). After Naruto said this the last standing dummy's ass area exploded it looked like it would be a rather painful and degrading way to die. 'to bad I cant use it agents sakura bitch.' Naruto smirked at the thought of her being disemboweled by his jutsu. Naruto the trained in taijutsu for the rest of the time it was a style that kyuubi said would complement his hybrid form. After about 1 more hour or so sasuke made his appearance noticing all the damage to the training field. He walked over by sakura to try to get some sympathy about getting his ass kicked the other day. Naruto was flipping backwards and kicked the clone he was fighting in the back of the head causing it to disappear.</p><p>About 2 hours after the appointed meeting time kakashi made his usual appearance "yo" he said with one of his freaky eye smiles.</p><p>"YOUR LATE." Sakura yelled at the tardy sensei. Naruto just growled at the dumb asses thinking they should all just blow up.</p><p>"Well we have our first C rank mission today so hurry and go pack." Sasuke left followed closely bye Sakura. Naruto just continued his training. "Hay naruto got pack" kakashi yelled. Naruto just smirked.</p><p>"I've already packed". Naruto then held up a summoning scroll smirking the whole time. "A ninja is ready for anything right." Kakashi nodded and turned to leave with naruto following to get to the gate where they would be meeting there client.</p><p>"Naruto what did you do to that training field back there it looked like the victim of a dragon attack." kakashi asked his student if you could call him that.</p><p>Naruto smirked "I was practicing a new jutsu and that was the result." Kakashi's eye bulged a little causing naruto to burst out laughing at the stupid look on Kakashi's face. "that wasn't even close to my most powerful jutsu." kakashi looked like he had just eaten something sickening. Naruto saw the front gate and decided to see how fast he really was "hey kakashi want to race to the gate." Kakashi looked like he wanted to run all right but not race he wanted to run and scream for his mommy this kid was way too strong.</p><p>"sure lets see what you are really capable of." With that the two ninja took off for the gate naruto and kakashi both seemed to disappear naruto reappeared at the gate a moment later so did kakashi. "Damn naruto you have improved. Not even gai can beat me by that much." kakashi did one of his eye smiles naruto smirked smugly.</p><p>"kakashi think we could spar sometime just for fun." Kakashi nodded he was curios now about how strong naruto really was. They walked over to the man they were supposed to protect.</p><p>"is this it that one looks too weak to be a ninja…" naruto moved faster than the eye could see and placed a kunai to the mans throat</p><p>"still think I'm too weak to be a ninja or do you want more of a demonstration." naruto said in a dangerous growl the man shook his head and naruto pulled the kunai away. After that the other two showed there dumb faces.</p><p>"Ok now that we're all here lets get going." Team seven and tazuna left to walk to wave country. Naruto ignored the others till kakashi waved him over. "Naruto how would you like to learn a new jutsu." Naruto nodded his head quickly (hey I cant change his personality completely now can I.). "ok its call the thunder cut. It's a B rank jutsu its three seals but it needs a lot of chakera to use. But once you've got that its no problem oh and its an assignation jutsu the seals are ox, hair, monkey then you focus chakera to your hand the attack will appear. It's really powerful. I know it doesn't make up for me ignoring you and sakura but I hope it's a start."</p><p>"No worries kakashi sensei I was just a little angry at every one yester day. I was a little out of line but it doesn't mean I didn't mean it and you can expect and ass wiping whenever you screw up." Naruto said as he noticed a puddle on the ground he smirked when he saw his sensei nod naruto's hands flew threw the hand seals he had just learned (don't hate me but naruto's goona be doing a lot of killing cause of his new blood lust) and charged the thunder cut just as the puddle tuned into two mist nin. Naruto turned just as they were about to attack. The thunder cut was visible now. Naruto rushed the two nin just as his eyes turned black. (think underworld lycanthrope's kk) Naruto used the chordi to rip into the chest of one of the nin just as he was about to throw the other one at him. Naruto smirked as he felt the mans heart explode. Naruto then used his other hand to grab the throat of the other nin and slammed him into the ground. Naruto removed his hand from the dead nin's chest and kicked the lifeless body away from him.</p><p>Naruto punched the living one in the face and knocked him out. "good job naruto lets tie him up and see why he attacked us. Naruto nodded and began to tie the nin up. When he was finished he threw the nin over his shoulder and walked over to kakashi. "sakura you stay here and guard tazuna me naruto and sasuke need to extract some information from this man." With that said naruto sasuke and kakashi walked into the woods. A few minutes later they heard the man start screaming.</p><p>An hour later the rest of team seven walked out of the woods kakashi and sasuke walked over to the other nin's body naruto came out of the woods a few seconds later and set the nin down next to his brother as they found out these were the demon brothers. Naruto grabbed there for head protectors and there I.D cards. He then took a couple steps back. All three preformed katon gyokutsen no jutsu (hope I spelled that right) and cremated the two body's. naruto sasuke and kakashi turned to see a very pale sakura and tazuna.</p><p>"Mr. tazuna we need to talk." kakashi said naruto and sasuke walked off to the side as sasuke asked naruto to teach him the chordi naruto began to explain it. By the time kakashi finished talking with tazuna sasuke could preformed the chordi fairly easily. Kakashi then waved naruto over "Why'd you teach sasuke the chordi?" kakashi asked.</p><p>"I don't need week teammates they have a better chance if there strong. Also this will be useful in the sense that I don't have to protect them too much." (see he's still cold as fuck.) "And if sasuke is willing to be friendly than so am I but I still don't like the prick." kakashi just laughed as they continued to walk.</p><p>A few hours later they where all riding across the river and marveling at the size of the bridge. When they reached the other side of the bridge they gave tazuna enough time to say good bye. Then they were off again. They were walking for 10 minutes when naruto threw a kunai into a nearby bush. Naruto quickly ran over there to try to kick the shit out of the opponent. But all that was there was a bunny. Naruto's eyes were darting every which way when he heard a sound like a blade flipping threw the air. Naruto hit the dirt dragging sakura and sasuke with him and kakashi did the same with tazuna.</p><p>Just as a giant sword flew over there heads. Naruto shot up to his feet to see a huge guy appear standing on the sword blade. Naruto smirked as the guy started to speak to kakashi about the bingo book and so on but naruto was only interested in the fight starting. Just as kakashi was about to lift his head protector naruto spoke up. "kakashi sensei let me fight this guy I really need the exercise." Naruto said in an almost board voice. Kakashi just smiled and nodded his ascent.</p><p>Naruto stepped forward and dropped into a fighting stance. "kakashi you offend me sending a wet behind the ears genin to fight an S class criminal like me. I'll end it quick so he doesn't suffer." With that Zabuza grabbed his sword and swung it at naruto. Naruto ducked under the blade and delivered a uppercut to Zabuza's jaw. Zabuza flipped and caught naruto in the jaw with his heel. Naruto dropped some barbs when he was kicked and they hit Zabuza in the face. Zabuza was caught off guard and yelled out in pain. Naruto landed on his feet and charged Zabuza. Naruto launched a series of blows with his feet and fists Zabuza was having trouble keeping up with the boy. Zabuza jumped back and created some distance between him and the wild genin.</p><p>"maybe you didn't insult me when you had this child fight me." Naruto smiled when he heard this. Suddenly a sword sliced through Naruto sakura screamed sasuke paled kakashi smirked. Naruto reappeared behind the water clone and slit its throat. The halved naruto poofed out of existence naruto disappeared and reappeared behind Zabuza and kicked him in the back of the head. Zabuza was surprised by the strength and speed of naruto. Zabuza flipped and landed on his feet he turned to defend with his sword just in time. Zabuza then punched naruto in the face. He then rushed and kicked naruto in the ribs sending him strait into the air. Naruto was getting really pissed his fingernails began to grow into claws his face started elongating into a canine like shape the sound was sickening. Naruto hit the ground as Zabuza started to charge him again but stopped short when he heard the snapping and stretching sound. Naruto looked up revealing his face which was now the muzzle of his hybrid form.</p><p>"I'm going to rip you limb from limb." Naruto shouted as he finished making the changed his clothes having long ago ripped free of his body. (think underworld lycan's). Naruto walked forward in his lycanthrope form. Naruto slashed at Zabuza with his claws. The missing nin barely avoided getting seriously hurt but still got cut. Naruto continued his attack and kicked Zabuza in the chest his claws on his toes slashing into the missing nin. Naruto punched him in the face causing the man to fly back into a tree. Just as naruto was about to finish off Zabuza two senbon needles flew into his neck. Zabuza's body went limp. Just then a masked nin appeared out of nowhere and gabbed Zabuza and disappeared again. Naruto then calmed enough to change back into his human form and passed out.</p><p>Holy cliffy oh well tell what you all think k bye bye then and thanks for all the addvice naruto-fanfic have a great time</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p>The next morning Naruto
woke to something shifting around on his chest. When he opend his
eyes all he could see was red witch almost caused him to panic but he
soon relized it was just something covering his face. Naruto moved
the red out of his face and quickly notaced that it was hair.
Flaming red hair he looked down to see a butiful young woman. She
had light freckles across her nose and even though her eye's where
closed he could tell they would have a slight slant to them which
would make her look highly exotic. The next thing he notaced was her
lack of clothing which caused him to blush rather heavily and avert
his eyes. This caused him to see nine fox tails waving behind her
happly as she slept. Now naruto was no longer the knuckle head he
once was but he was still a knuckle head. In other words 3 2 1
Naruto's eyes grew wide as dinner plates "HOLY SHIT KYUUBI"
quickly covers his mouth and listens carefully and once he was sure
no one was coming he looked back at the kyuubi who's eyes where
fluttering open.</p><p>"<b>Kit why are you
being so loud" </b>Naruto sweatdroped slightly before
scratching the back of his head nerviously.</p><p>"well it was a
surprise to see you out of my mind for one and two your naked and
laying on my chest" naruto pointed out as the kyuubi rubed the
sleep from her eyes. she imeadiatly did a double take.</p><p><b>"Wait what?"</b> She looked down at her self and blushed lightly "<b>Oh great
I'm thirteen again</b>.<b> Well then I guess I got my wish."</b> kyuubi whispered. And due to his lycanthrope hearing yes Naruto
heard her and blushed deeper red if that was at all possable. Naruto
quickly wraped kyuubi in the blanket that seperated the two of them
and helped her sit up. "<b>So this is a human body i havent
used one in almost a thousand years."</b> Kyuubi coughed twice
before her voice took on a much lighter tone.</p><p>"Now Naruto I
soppose I should explain huh." Naruto nodded rapidly "Well
then once you became a werewolf your body started to reject my soul
but since our souls are bound by your seal I can not return to my
demon form. Pluse i don't want to leave your side I have taken a
liking to you in more then one way." at this both kyuubi and
Naruto blushed. "You have an indomorable spirit and an
increadible amount of strength. Any way the majority of my power is
still sealed inside of you. It will soon be intergrated into your
own. It will also be linked to me and allows us both to draw off of
each others power. Now I'm not sure this could be an asset or a
curse for us both eaither way we will have to train heavily kit."
as the kyuubi finished her explanation Naruto was deep in thought.</p><p>"Well one stop
calling me kit your no older than me now and two your right we will
need to become much stronger. But the biggest problem right now is
how to explain you away so that sasuke and them don't figure out who
you really are." Kyuubi nodded her agreement slightly surprised
by how much smarter naruto really was then people gave him credit
for.</p><p>Kyuubi got a mischivious
grin and purred out "Well you could always tell them you met me
last night while out on a strole." Naruto blushed at the
responses he would get from kakashi and shook his head despratly no.</p><p>"I don't think so
how about I heard you being muged and decided to save you last
night." Naruto looked at kyuubi for her answer. Kyuubi hated
being portrayed as weak also saw this was the best way.</p><p>"allright but what
am I suposed to say about having no clothes." naruto smirked and
pulled out a scroll opening it quickly he bit his thumb and spread
his blood over the scroll. Which snaped closed and in a puff of
smoke turned into a light yellow sun dress. Kyuubi gave him a look
that screamed what the fuck.</p><p>"Well you never know
what you might incounter being a ninja so you should always be
prepared to take care of some one." Naruto said honestly. <i>Wow
naruto really is much more mature then I thought</i> Kyuubi thought
looking at Naruto in a new light and quickly puts on the dress. Her
tails recead into her tail bone answering Naruto's unasked question.
Just as she finished smoothing out the dress sakura burst into the
room.</p><p>"Naruto i heard your
voice and was wond...WHO THE HELL IS THAT NARUTO?" at the
sound of sakuras voice kyuubi jumped into naruto's lap her legs on
eaither side of his leaving them in a highly questionable position
earning a blush from both of them.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------</p><p>hows that for a cliffy
what do you guys think naruto will tell sakura and how about kyuubi's
new alies you will all find out soon i promise and i'm sorry it took
so long to post and that this chapters so short but hey shit happens
right see ya all later peace</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>Naruto and Kyuubi where
both in a rather unapealing pozition infront of sakura. Kyuubi did
the one thing that made sence to her she kissed Naruto. And not one
of those pussy ass wimpy pecks eaither this was a holy shit I want
you now type kiss. Sakura saw this and blushed before closing the
door quickly. On the other side of the door sakura couldn't be any
redder then she allready was. "<I>did Naruto just kiss that
girl...and for that matter what did I just interupt"</I> 
Sakura at that moment got a nose bleed to rival anyone's in konaha.</p><P>Back in the room Kyuubi
had yet to break the kiss since Naruto had just gotten into it and
was kissing her back with such passion that she could feel her body
responding as any ones would. Kyuubi finally broke the kiss panting
lightly before looking at where a small trickle of blood was coming
from under the door and grined knowing what that little pink idiot
had probly been thinking of. She moved off of naruto and stood
examaning her new body which was for a thirteen year old rather
attractive red hair fair pale skin powerfull leg muscles freackals in
just the right spots to make her look good. Yup she was damn good
looking for a human and she could tell Nauto thought so too.</p><P>Kyuubi's eye's wandered
to Naruto's lips thinking of how good of a kisser he was before she
shook the thought away. Naruto stood and streatched having slept in
only his boxers Kyuubi got a good look at his well toned chest
stomach arms legs in all honesty she decided she hated her hormones. 
Naruto pulled on a pair of black baggy pants tied his kunai holster
on and his pouch before pulling on his fishnet long sleeved shirt. 
"allright lets go get this over with so no one else interupts us
when we are speaking in privite." Kyuubi nodded thinking "<I>oh
thats much better you might as well be whereing no shirt at all"</I></p><P>Naruto swept past her and
opened the door almost triping over sakura's prone form before calmly
steping over her and continuing to head down stairs and sit at the
table. Kyuubi followed making sure to step on sakura as she exited
the room sitting to naruto's right. kakashi sasuke tazuna and
tsunami where all stareing at the new face then at Naruto as if for
an explanation. "This is..." Naruto looked at kyuubi
expectantly</p><P>"Kyu Naruto-kun
saved me last night." Kyuubi said as bubbly as possable before
clinging to Naruto's arm trying her best to seem as unlike her as
possable. Just then sakura stumbled down the stairs.</p><P>"So thats it I
thought..." Sakura got a rather ebarresed look on her face and
seemed to refuse to look at any one.</p><P>"Yes miss what did
you think" Kyuubi said sending a death glare twords Sakura who
just blushed harder mumbling incohearently and sitting at the table
on naruto's left. Kyu (I'm just going to call her kyu from now on
deal with it mwahahahaha) growled under her breath and pulled Naruto
away from Sakura.</p><P>"Yes this is Kyu I
heard her last night getting mugged so I jumped out the window and
beat the thugs senceless and let her sleep in my room. She WILL be
staying with me untill further notice and we will be training
togeather...ALONE." Naruto add's as an afterthought glaring at
Sasuke. Tsunami served breakfast giving Kyu a sarrowfull look.</p><P>"If you need some
one to talk to woman to woman you can come to me." she says with
a sorry smile as kyuubi just eats quickly beaten only by naruto in
the speed at which her food disapeard. They both stood up and bowed
thanking tsunami for the food before leaving and walking to a nice
hidden grove where they could train in peace.</p><P>"Allright Naurto you
need alot of work on your chakera controll and I need to work on my
physicall strength so I know just the training method for us both. 
All you need to do is charge a small amount of chakera into your
muscles this will increase your strength by at least three times what
it normally is but thats for you since you need to increase you
chakera controll before risking going any further." Kyu
explained Naruto nodded understaning most of it.</p><P>"Okay but how much
chakera should I use?" Was all naruto said again surpriseing
Kyu at how much he had grown in a few short weeks after being bitten
by the wolf.</p><P>"Not much just
enough to feel your muscles start to expand." Kyu responded
before droping into a fighting stance. Naruto formed the rat seal
and foucused the chakera into his muscles feeling them begin to
expand before droping into a stance of his own. Kyu moved in a flash
charging Naruto who narrowly avoided a kick sent twords his gut. 
Naruto subconsiously charged a little chakera into his eye's changing
them to his wolf eye's and Kyu's movement seemed to slow down to him.
 Kyu droped her uper body supporting her wheght with her hands and
brought her other leg around to kick twords Naruto's head Naruto
brought his left arm up to his right side catching her leg and
smirking at the surprised look on her face. Naruto then brought his
left foot up to kick twords her gut which landed hard and sent Kyu
skidding acrossed there makeshift training grounds. Kyu stood
shaking slightly from the blow coughing lightly as well. "<I>damn
how did he see that. much less how did he respond to that.</I>"
Naruto moved to the right fast enough to almost dissapear. All Kyu
could see was a bler so she quickly brought her arms up in time to
protect her face agents a hard blow to her face again sending her
skidding across the ground. Kyu recovered quickly and charged some
of her own chakera into her eye's in time to block another punch from
Naruto. Naruto twisted his hands and grabed Kyu's wrist and threw
her over his shoulder. Kyu fliped in the air and landed on her feet
ducking another punch and sweeping Naruto's feet out from under him. 
She straddaled his hips and pined him grabing a kunai from his pouch
and holding it to his neck.</p><P>"Very good Naruto I
could expect..." Naruto fliped her over his head and pined her
the same way holding her unarmed hand away and her hand holding the
kunai to her own throat. "y..you win." Kyu stamered out
surprise clearly in her voice.</p><P>"No I don't you are
not at even a sixteenth of what you once where Kyu-chan." Kyu
blushes at the chan suffex but nodded in responce Knowing it was
true. Naruto stood up pulling the kunai away and placing it back
into it's holster then pulled Kyu up to her feet. Kyu stumbled into
Naruto's chest who held her up effortlessly. Kyu seemed to relax
alot in his arms before she shook her head and pulled away. 
"T..thanks Naruto-kun."</p><P>Holy flippin cliffy huh

</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>All right thanks for all
of the reveiws love the opinons and hope you all are enjoying my
story the resaults of the little poll I held is Naruto-all three plus
kin and now tayuya sorry if I spelled that wrong deal with it any way
here's my next peace of work oh and beware this is a lemon for the
first part of it.</p><P>Kyu's mind was in turmoil
not to mention her hormons where driving her crazy. "<I>he was
so close and he smelt so good...a screw it theres no one around to
see."</I> Kyu pressed her self agenst Naruto and lightly kissed
his collerbone. Naruto of course had no idea what the hell was going
on. Here was Kyu doing things that where getting quite the reaction
from his body. And man did they feel good.</p><P>"Kyu wh..what are
you doing." Naruto managed to stammer out. In response kyu
slid her left hand down his body to his little friend earning a moan
from Naruto.</p><P>"I'm going to make
you a man Naruto-kun." Kyu said slowly massaging his member
threw what she had dubed troublesome pants. Naruto suddenly had an
Idea of what was about to happen since he had stollen a copy of icha
icha paridice once and started blushing. Kyu mean while ran her
right hand up Naruto's hips and under his fish net shirt feeling his
skin on her's became her main concern in a instant. Kyu lifted his
shirt off and tossed it in a heap near a tree. Naruto for a moment
was to stuned to do anything before he decided he really wanted this.
 Naruto leaned down and kissed Kyu with a unhinged passion pushing
her back agenst a tree. Kyu in response moaned into his lips before
lifter herself up and wraping her legs around Naruto's hips. Naruto
was trying his best to remember what he had read in that icha icha
paridise book. He leaned down and softly sucked on Kyu's neck.</p><P>"That feel's good
Naruto-kun." Kyu said in a husky voice. She was allready
working away at Naruto's belt which came undone thanks to her expert
hands. Kyu was slightly surprised by Naruto's forwardness but she
really didn't mind as she undid his pants letting them drop around
his ankels. Naruto steped out of them and reached a hand up and
started to massage Kyu's right breast causing her to moan louder. 
Naruto leaned back enough to pull the dress Kyu was wearing over her
head and tossing it aside next to his shirt. Kyu was now exposed to
the elements and giving naruto quite the veiw. Naruto hadn't really
looked but Kyu he had to admit had a beutiful body. Her pale skin
just made her look all the better. Naruto decended on her left
breast liking a trail over the entire thing. Kyu leaned her head
back moaning. "<I>god is this the same Naruto who couldn't even
talk to a girl not a month or two ago."</I> Kyu thought as she
used her feet to pull Naruto's boxers down.</p><P>Naruto grined into her
chest and lightly sucked on her nipple causing fire like desire to
shoot threw Kyu's body. She started grinding her body agenst his. 
Naruto couldn't help but to moan lightly at this causing Kyu to grin.
 Kyu reached down and grabed Naruto's member and aimed it at her
slit. "Thrust your hips forward quickly." Kyu whispered
into Naruto's ear. Naruto did as he was told and thrust as hard as
he could into Kyu which caused Kyu to scream as her verginity was
taken from her for the seccond time in her life. Naruto was worried
for a moment thinking he had hurt her and tryed to pull out. Kyu
just tightened her grip with her leg's holding him in place. "Don't
worry that's normal Naruto-kun just move in and out slowly." 
Kyu instructed. Naruto nodded and again did as he was told. Naruto
for a moment thought he had died and gone to heaven as he felt the
tight warmness that was Kyu around him. Kyu moaned as the pain soon
left her body and was replaced by pleasure. "Faster." Kyu
said and Naruto was happy to do so as he thrust into her faster and
faster every time there hips slaped togeather.</p><P>Kyu leaned her head back
and purred loving the feeling of being filled for the first time in
this body. Naruto bit his lip panting heavily enjoying the sound of
Kyu purring he then leaned forward and kissed her deeply not breaking
pace. Kyu called out into his lips cuming hard and tightening around
him. Naruto felt this and soon a feeling of utter joy spread over
his body. Exaution soon caught up with him as he slumped agenst Kyu
panting heavily. Kyu leaned her head down onto his shoulder
shivering as the last of her orgasm passed threw her body. Naruto
eased her to the gound helping her stand for a little bit before they
broke apart.</p><P>"Wow Naruto that was
just amazing...was that your first time?" Kyu asked tentivly.</p><P>Naruto nodded. "Yeah
it was but I have read icha icha paridise once before so I just did
what I remembered reading." Naruto blushed lightly as Kyu grind
devilishly.</p><P>"we need to get you
more of those books." Naruto and Kyu laughed lightly. Naruto
looked up at the sky seeing the sun was directly over head meaning it
was noon.</p><P>"Well we need to get
back it's time for lunch." Naruto said and Kyu nodded her
agreement. Naruto quickly got dressed once more as Kyu did the same.
 They started on there way back to Tazuna's house Naruto grabed Kyu's
hand as they walked and chatted about nothing in general. When they
walked threw the front door Kakashi was waiting for them doing his
creepy eye smile. It was then that they relized how they had to look
and blushed Kyu snatching her hand away and running into the kitchen
to help Tsunami with lunch.</p><P>"Naruto I know what
happened between you two and I have something for you." Kakashi
grined and handed Naruto a copy of icha icha paridise valume two. 
"Read it it will help you keep her happy." Kakashi said
with a grin.</p><P>"Thanks kakashi but
how do you know we did anything." Naruto said suspiciosly
glaring at Kakashi.</p><P>"Simple I followed
you to see what you would do but I left before things got to siriose"
 Kakashi said almost sounding proud. Naruto just blushed and thanked
him for the book before setting about to reading it. The two of them
walked into the dinning room noses planted into there copy's of icha
icha paridise. Naruto couldnt help but snicker at the look on
sakera's face.</p><P>"KAKASHI SENSEI YOU
CORUPTED NARUTO TOO." She yelled out only to have a kunai land
in the table infront of her hands. Naruto's hand was extended still
so it was obviously him who threw the weapon.</p><P>"Sakura do me a
favor and shut the fuck up. This book is a valuble learning tool to
any man looking to improve himself." Kakashi nodded in
agreement Sasuke looked intrested in the books but was clearly trying
to hide it. Sakura had a hurt expression on her face since Naruto
had been the one who threw the kunai and it had almost hit her. 
Naruto sat across the table from her and pulled the kunai out and put
it away. Naruto quickly burried his face back into the book as Kyu
and Tsunami came out with the food. Both Naruto and Kakashi put
there book's away into the pouches behind there backs. Naruto wiped
the blood that had started to trickle out of his nose and dug into
the food. Kyu and Tsunami sat down as every one else started eating
as well.</p><P>After the meal everyone
went out for training and not long later Kyu and Naruto had finished
there training. "Come on Naruto lets go back." Kyu said
cheerfully.</p><P>"Naw I want to get a
little more training in before I go back." Kyu nodded and
walked away as Naruto created twelve shadow clones and started
sparing with them. A couple hours later Naruto was exhosted so he
layed down under a tree and decided to take a nap.</p><P>Naruto woke the next
morning to the sight of a beutiful you lady smiling down at him. 
"Have I died and gone to heaven?" Naruto asked thinking
the woman was an angel. The young girl just blushed and shook her
head no.</p><P>"No you where just
sleeping here so I decided to wake you." The young woman said. 
"My name is Haku it's nice to meet you mister..." Haku said
waiting for Naruto to give her his name.</p><P>"Naruto you can call
me Naruto." Naruto said huriedly extending his hand to shake
her's.</p><P>allright there ya go
chappi six so tell me what yall think and all that I'll get to work
on seven my next chance peace to all my loyle readers and all that
good stuff</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>As
Naruto was walking back to Tazuna's his mind kept drifting to the
conversation he had with Haku. Naruto was so distracted he didn't
notice the young man infront of him till he ran into him knocking
them both over. Naruto sprung back up to his feet and looked twords
the young man he had knocked over.</p><P>"I'm
sorry sir I wasn't watching where I was going" Naruto said
politely. (yeah I know naruto being polite scary huh.) Naruto
offered his hand to the young man and helped him up. "I
appologize profusly." Naruto said agian. A few moments later
the young man broke into laughter.</p><P>"Naw
don't worry about it Naruto-san." Naruto's eyes widend slightly
when he heard his name he hadn't told this person his name. The
young man grined at Naurto's response. "You would be surprised
by what you can find out by smell. My name is Kogamaru and I'm a
lycan like you. In fact your the reason we're here." Naruto
looked around and saw no one else.</p><P>"What
do you mean by we?" Naruto asked narrowing his eyes in
suspision.</p><P>"Simple
the pack that was asigned to you by fenrir the wolf goddess." 
Kogamaru said as if it was the most obvious thing in the world. 
Naruto just blinked for a few moments till Kogamaru spoke up again. 
"Follow me and I'll introduce you to the pack theres not many of
us but there's enough." As Kogamaru started to walk twords the
woods Naruto grabed his arm.</p><P>"First
let me see your face." Naruto said calmly. Kogamaru turned and
removed his hood and threw his cloak back revealing that his outfit
was made almost entirly of belts he had silver hair that came to
about the middle of his back. He had yellow slited eyes and rather
pale skin not to mention he looked kinda thin like he was under fed. 
But his most notable feature was the four scars that ran down his
left eye. Naruto nodded and signaled for him to continue on which he
did. Kogamaru walked swiftly into the woods Naruto close on his
heels staring at the katana across his back. It had a white handle
with the kanji for hevan on it.</p><P>A few
moments later they came to a clearing where there were two other
people sitting around a camp fire. One of them had tall spiky hair
blonde and five swords across his back all of them huge. The other
one had long black hair that looked like if he was standing would
come to the back of his knee's. He was whereing a white gee and
white pants he too had a katana across his back only it a black
handle with the kanji for hell on it.</p><P>"that
there is itchimaru." Kogamaru points to the other katana
weilder. "he is a lycan as well and that is jutsukin he just has
fenrir's blessings and the iron strength bloodline." Kogamaru
gestures twords Jutsukin. Naruto nodded as the other two looked up
twords him.</p><P>"So
this is the alpha huh he dosn't look like much but we'll find out
what he can do soon enough." Itchimaru says looking boared. 
Jutsukin nodded his agreement on the issue. Jutsukin stood up and
put the fire out by stompin it leaving a small crater in his wake. 
Naruto's jaw droped at the impressive feat of strength. Jutsukin
then turned and bowed to Naruto.</p><P>"We
are at your comand my alpha." both Itchimaru and Kogamaru
slaped there foreheads at this. Jutsukin stood straight and just
looked confused.</p><P>"Well
this all is pretty new to me so I thankyou but I don't know what an
alpha is." Kogamaru just gaped like a fish at Naruto. "Naruto
an alpha is the person or wolf that is the leader of a pack." 
Kogamaru explained quickly to which Naruto nodded squinting his eye's
in thought.</p><P>"So
that means I'm the leader of you guy's?" Naruto asked getting a
nod from each of them in turn. "Ok then well that would mean I
can leave my team and claim you all as my new team then?" he
asked again receaving a nod from each of them. Naruto's face broke
into a sadistic grin that would have made orochimaru cringe in frear.
 Naruto gestured for them to follow him and started for tazua's home
again.</p><P>When
then got there Naruto told the others to wait outside while he ran
inside. Five minutes later Naruto came back outside followed closly
by Kyu who was rubbing the sleep from her eye's. "Why where you
sleeping it's bearly noon." Naruto said iratably. Kyu just
shruged "I'm used to taking alot of naps and our activity
earlyer didn't help much." Kyu grined wickedly. She then
stiffend when she saw the three new arivals standing right infront of
her.</p><P>um
sorry this took so long I have been kinda bussy any way enjoy and I
hope you all want more lol peace</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P>Kyu
couldn't help but gap at these three powerful looking young men. While there appearance wouldn't inspire too much confidence in a
fist fight except for the large one with the scroll on his back there
scent said otherwise. Kyu turned to the now grinning Naruto. "Naruto who the hell are they?" She asked pointing to the three
young men.</P><P>"Apparently
they're my pack mates." Naruto started scratching the back of
his head nervously. Itchimaru cut in deciding to make himself known.</P><P>"The
goddess fenrir has taken a liking to our young alpha to be. She
hasn't seen a wolf as strong as Naruto in many years. Hell his fur
is white making him even more unique. We will follow him as our
alpha but don't think for a moment that that makes him our master. He's just our leader." Itchimaru finished earning nods from
Kogamaru and Jutsukin.</P><P>"Ha
ha well I wouldn't want to be the master of you guys. I'd much
rather be your friend." Naruto said as he gestured for them to
head inside. They all sat around the dining room table. Each of
them took off there cloaks and hung them up on the wall revealing
there actual clothes. Jutsukin was wearing a black vest and baggy
black pants. He had a large scroll on his back with a hidden sun
forehead protector tied around it. (that's the only one I didn't
explain so that's all I'm going to do.) They all sat down and
waited quietly for Naruto to start.</P><P>"Ok
well I'll go first. My name is Naruto Uzamaki I like Kyu-chan
ramen beef and training. I dislike most of my team and the time it
takes for ramen to cook. And my dream for the future is to become
the Hokage or start a village of my own." Naruto finished as he
placed his hands behind his head.</P><P>"Well
my name is Kogamaru Izaku I like chakra and ninjutsu. I dislike
people who judge others by appearance and stuck up ass holes. My
dream for the future is to become a powerful lycan ninja." Kogamaru said quickly.</P><P>"My
name is Itchimaru Moruzo I like medical techniques Taijutsu and
pocky. I dislike the entire Uchiha clan since they like to steal
other peoples techniques. My dream for the future is to become a
world renown medical Nin and Taijutsu expert." Itchimaru smiled at
his friends who nodded knowing he was well on his way.</P><P>"My
name is Jutsukin. I like training and learning forbidden Jutsu. I
dislike lots of things so I won't give you a complete list right
now. And my dream for the future is to know every forbidden Jutsu
there is and collecting the rest of the legendary blades." Jutsukin grinned over at his friends who just shook there heads.</P><P>"Yeah
you go and learn those Jutsu but leave us out of it. We don't need
the trouble you brought us when we where in Kiri." Itchimaru said
with a sigh.</P><P>"I'm
almost afraid to ask but what do you mean?" Kyu asked nervously. Kogamaru sighed before turning to her and beginning the strange
story.</P><P>"Well
you see Jutsukin here has this nasty tendency to steal the forbidden
Jutsu scrolls of every village he visits. He always returns them
mind you but not till after he's learned every forbidden Jutsu in
the scroll." Kogamaru sighed before glaring at his friend. "Well
we where looking for Naruto when we stopped in Kiri for a few weeks. Me and Itchimaru where sitting around our hotel room when in comes
Jutsukin looking half panicked. He tells us we gotta go and we gotta
go now. Well we bolt thinking Jutsukin had found a lead but it was
fading fast. We get out of town and camp for the night when Jutsukin
pulls out a scroll and starts to read. Not two minutes later a group
of Kiri hunter Nin jump out of the woods and start attacking us. We
barely manage to beat them Jutsukin looks at us and says one
sentence. 'Oops didn't think they'd catch on so quick.'" Naruto and Kyu started laughing there asses off.</P><P>"This
dunder head then tries to go and apologize to the kage only to end up
in jail." Itchimaru laughed out. "We ended up having to break
him out of jail and running for three days straight to loose the
hunter Nin on our trail." By this point Naruto was holding his
sides and Kyu was having trouble breathing. "We finally find a nice
place to stop and he says 'well at least I finished learning those
Jutsu.' Oh we wanted to kill him." Itchimaru chuckled as they
all settled down a little. Jutsukin whipped a tear from his eye as
he calmed his laughter down a bit.</P><P>"Oh
come on you guys it's not that bad." Jutsukin said trying to
salvage some of his dignity.</P><P>"No
it's not but it's still funny as hell." Naruto laughed out. They where so busy laughing and having fun getting to know each other
they didn't even notice Tsunami walk into the room. She looked
over all at the table before making her presence known.</P><P>"Naruto-kun
who are they?" She asked while Naruto jumped a little.</P><P>"Jeez
Tsunami-san don't sneak up on me like that." Naruto gasped out
as he clutched his chest. "And they are some friends of mine I met
up with in the woods. This is Kogamaru Itchimaru and Jutsukin." He gestured to each one in tern. "When I get back home we're
going to be becoming a team of our own. Well as long as Oji-san has
no problem with it. We even have a Jounin lined up." he said
pointing to Jutsukin catching the other boy off guard.</P><P>"Hey
since when was I a Jounin?" Jutsukin asked waving his hands in
front of himself.</P><P>"Since
you're the one with the largest Jutsu list under your belt." Naruto said with his trademark fox grin firmly in place. Tsunami
couldn't help but smile at the antics of these boys as Jutsukin
jumped across the table and started giving Naruto a noogie.</P><P>"Hey
how about a little warning the next time you make a decision like
that." Jutsukin said as Naruto desperately tried to get him off. Kogamaru and Itchimaru just started laughing as Kyu just shook her
head. Tsunami started making breakfast while they sat and chatted
amongst themselves.</P><P>Kakashi
came down with his nose buried in his pervy book as always. He
glanced up and saw the new people and his jaw dropped at the sight of
the three strange looking young men. "Naruto please explain who
they are." Kakashi demanded in a stern voice.</P><P>"My
new team." Naruto said calmly yet dangerously. Almost as if he was
daring Kakashi to tell him otherwise.</P><P>"Naruto
you have a team. Why would you want to change that?" Kakashi
asked now more curious then anything else.</P><P>"Cause
I don't like my teammates at all. I don't think I could bring
myself to risk my life for them." Naruto explained. "Plus two
of them are my kind while the other is blessed by my kind." Naruto
finished with a sigh.</P><P>"That
and Naruto-kun needs to protect his own future." Kyu added as she
started to nuzzle up to him a little bit.</P><P>"Hey
Naruto lets go train a little. We gotta know what you need to know
ya know?" Kogamaru added in his usual laid back way. Naruto
nodded as Tsunami started serving breakfast.</P><P>"How
about we go after we eat? I'm famished." Naruto said with a
small amount of drool forming at the corner of his mouth. Sakura and
Sasuke finally made a appearance.</P><P>"Who
are the losers?" Sasuke asked as he started to sit down only to
get kicked across the room by a very cranky Jutsukin.</P><P>"Who's
a loser? Naruto Kogamaru and Itchimaru could have blocked that
easy." Jutsukin said with a grin of superiority. Sasuke forced
himself to a standing position and glared at the stronger Nin.</P><P>"I
challenge you to a fight right now." Sasuke said through gritted
teeth.</P><P>"Sasuke's
so cool." Sakura said completely ignoring the fact that he had just
been kicked like a soccer ball. Jutsukin looked back at Naruto who
nodded grinning.</P><P>"You
got yourself a fight dipshit. I'll try my best not to kill him
Kakashi-san." Jutsukin said with not humor in his voice. Everyone
filled outside as Sasuke and Jutsukin prepared to square off.</P><P>"Tch
your going to need those blades of yours to even touch me." Sasuke
said with his usual cocky voice. In response Jutsukin took off every
one of the blades and tossed them to Kogamaru. Kogamaru caught them
and fell over backwards.</P><P>"I
swear these things get heavier and heavier every time you take them
off." Kogamaru complained from his prone position on the ground.</P><P>"Quit
your bitching." Itchimaru said as he helped his friend up.</P><P>"I
will only need my pinky to beat you." Jutsukin said as he held up
his pinky with a wicked grin on his face. Sasuke got pissed and
charged only to get flicked in the forehead sending him back a
little bit. "That's only 1 percent of my strength." Jutsukin
laughed as Sasuke charged again. Sasuke dropped low and spun in a
sweeping kick only to meet air. Jutsukin however stood above him as
he flicked Sasuke straight down into the grown creating a two foot
deep crater. "And that's still only twenty percent." Sasuke
however didn't hear a word Jutsukin had said since he was already
unconscious.</P><P>He
he I bet yall thought I forgot about this story didn't ya. Guess
what nope just been busy with other things. Well here's the newest
chapter. Try to figure out why Jutsukin is so strong. If you can
I'll give you a cookie.</P>
