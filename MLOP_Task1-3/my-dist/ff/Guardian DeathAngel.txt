1</B></P><P>The
day has finally come to an end. The sun is just about to disappear
and in its leave, leave behind a beautiful view of a red and orange
sky. But today it will also leave behind a battle that has just been
finished, a battle between two great warriors or more precisely
two very great and strong shinobis'.</P><P>One
of these two is a man who has blue shin,
blue hair, black eyes and has sharp teeth, to be more exact, you
could mistaken him as a earth living/breathing man-shark. The man's
name is Kisame and is a member of an organization called Akatsuki,
whose goal is it to destroy the world and then build and rule it as
they like, by using the power of the Nine Bijuu demons (I hope that's
what they are called, can't really remember it)</P><P>The
other person is a young and beautiful woman or teen, with long golden
blond hair, that goes down to her hip and
can only be rival to sun, it has deep red almost blood red highlights
in it. Her eyes a deep blue that can only be compared to the heaven
or the deep blue ocean with black slits as pupils. On each of her
cheeks are three, very thin, whiskers like marks, her skin a
beautiful tan in color. She is not very tall compared to other girls
of her ages, her high reaches to 1.58, her body of its own is very
well build. Her form is very beautiful, you can see that she has work
out but it has not given her oversized and ugly muscles, like men has
them, but a beautiful body which other women's would kill for and
with C-cup breast, she looks like a goddess. Her name is Namikaze
Uzumaki Narumi and is the container of the demon lord Kyubi no Kisune
since her birth and since her fourteens birthday, she has merge with
the Kyubi, making her a half demon. Now, many will think that the
Kyubi has now disappeared, but that's not true, Kyubi no Kisune is
still very much alive and has a plan in his mind, which he is about
to set in motion.</P><P>Back
to the fight that has just ended. Both
Kisame and Narumi are lying on the ground both looking like they have
been through hell and back. Kisame almost having lost everything of
his clothes, the only thing remaining is the upper part of his pants
protecting his little "friend" from view. His Akatsuki cloak or
what's left of it, lying only 5 feet from him. On Kisame self you
can see deep and long cut wounds, burns and other things you can
imaging as wounds, and he has lost his swordsman arm, making him
barely alive because of blood lost.</P><P>Narumi,
not faring any better than Kisame, has also almost lost all of her
clothes, with only the upper part of her black shinobi pants left and
the top of her t-shirt to cover over her breast, and her body covered
with cuts and wounds but luckily for her, not missing any body-parts.
And like Kisame, Narumi also only barely alive, but a bit more than
Kisame, because of him losing an arm.</P><P>They
both didn't notice the red mist getting
from Narumi starting to form 6 feet from her, beginning to get
thicker and thicker and starting to look more like a person.</P><P>After
ten minutes the red mist disappeared and in its place stands a tall
man of 1.80 with dark red hair, reaching
under mid back, red eyes with black slits like pupils and on each of
his cheeks are three whiskers like marks, his skin a light brown in
color and very well build like an athlete. He would have looked like
a normal and very handsome young man if it wasn't for the fox like
ears on his head and nine red-like tales swaying behind him. That's
right, standing there was the demon lord himself, Kyubi
no Kisune, and he is free.</P><P>Kyubi
looks around at his surroundings, his eyes landing on the two people
lying on the ground; he eyes Narumi's
still form and goes over it with his eyes. He smirks and his long
K9's sticks out, looking very sharp and dangerous. "<B>Finally,
after sixteen years of imprison, I'm finally free again. And this
time no one is going to lock me in.</B>"Kyubi
said. Kyubi then goes over to Narumi's body, bends down and lift
her up slowly and tenderly, holding her close to his body
protectively. He then goes over to Kisame's body, looking at it
with disgust and hatred. He bends down, still holding Narumi close to
him with one of his arm, and lift Kisame up by the hair, so high that
his feet don't touch the ground. Kisame, even though barely alive,
open his eyes and looks Kyubi directly in the eyes that sends a
shiver down his spine and makes him want to look away but can't
because he's too weak. "W... w... who are you?" Kisame ask,
although more like whispering it because of his weak state he is in.</P><P>Kyubi
smirks, showing his long and sharp K9's again. "<B>Aww,
don't say you can't recognize me, I'm hurt. I'm the one you
and your friends are after.</B>" Kyubi
answers in mock hurt. Kisame stares at Kyubi with wide eyes, his
mouth capping like a fish out of the water. "You, you are Kyubi no
Kisune? You, you shouldn't be free, how is this possible?" Kisame
ask with surprise and fear in his voice and eyes and shakes like a
leaf. Kyubi's smirk goes wide to an evil and insane grin. He stares
in Kisame's eyes with madness and bloodlust reflecting his, making
Kisame almost want to piss himself. "<B>Surprised,
right! You see, I have been working for this moment in sixteen years
now, and today was finally the day where I could get free, thanks to
you.</B> <B>If
you haven't come and have this almost to death fight with little
Narumi here, and made her this weak, I would have to wait a bit more
to get free, so as a thank you, I will let you live and give a
message to your so called friends. If I get a hint or a feeling that
you or any other person from your organization is anywhere near me or
Narumi, I will make sure that YOU and your "FRIENDS", will regret
it all your living life and all eternity in hell. Understand?</B>"
Kyubi said with a threat in his voice. Kisame, without being able to
form a competent sentence, could only nod a yes.</P><P>After getting Kisame's affirmative,
he throws him 50 meters away without caring where he lands. Kyubi
starts walking away from the battle ground, still holding the
unconscious Narumi bridal style, protectively close to his body, well
aware of four people watching him the whole time he had his
"conversation" with Kisame.</P><P>Ten
minutes further back, in the woods around
the clearing where the battle has taking place, you can see three
people running through the trees, stopping only a half meter away
from the clearing behind a couple of bushes, where they can stand
well hiding, but still see and hear what's going on in the ones
known battle ground. Those three people are Narumi's old teammates,
Kakashi, the sensei of team 7, and hasn't showed any real interest
in Narumi, he has silver gravity defying hair, one black eye and the
other showing a red eye with black commas', watching the persons
and things happening on the clearing. His lower face is hidden by a
face mask, and he is wearing his normal jounin attire. The other
person is Sakura, one of the people who have ignored Narumi and hated
her without any real reason, except like any other villager hate her
for, she has more than ones punch or yelled at her, without Sakura
knowing that Narumi has let her do it. Sakura has pink hair, green
eyes, and is still wearing the red-pink short china dress, with slits
at the sides and black form fitting shorts under the dress, going
almost to her knees. The last and third person of the group is the
"new" member of the team 7 Sai. Sai has taking the place of
Uchiha Sasuke, the old member of team 7 before he betrayed Konaha and
went to Oroshimaru, after almost three years killing him when Sasuke
thought that Oroshimaru couldn't train him anymore. Sai shows no
emotion, only fake smiles, and is the only one in team 7 who has
become a friend to Narumi. Sai has black short hair, black eyes and
he is very pale. He is wearing a black top with long sleeves, showing
his belly and shoulders. He is also wearing black form fitting
shinobi pant with a belt, where his paint brush and bottles with ink
are sitting.</P><P>All three of them
are looking at what's happening out in the clearing where Kyubi is
now walking over to Narumi's body.</P><P>At
the same time on the other side from Kakashi, Sakura and Sai, also
hiding from view, is Uchiha Sasuke
standing. Sasuke, still looking the same only taller and with a bit
longer hair (Sorry, I don't want to describe Sasuke, he is looking
like the same, when he was with Oroshimaru, don't be mad), is
also looking at Kyubi and especially Narumi with interest and lust.</P><P>Back
to Kyubi and Narumi, still unconscious. Kyubi
was just about to leave with Narumi, when Kakashi, Sakura and Sai
jumped out of their "hiding" place, still not knowing that Kyubi
knew they were there and that the last one is still hiding, standing
before Kyubi blocking his way from leaving.</P><P>Kakashi
takes some steps forward so he is only a couple of meters away from
Kyubi. Kakashi looks over Kyubi then to Narumi, checking if there is
any serious damage on her. Kyubi seeing the worry look in his eyes
begins to laugh, breaking Kakashi from his thoughts about Narumi. He
looks at Kyubi with narrowed eyes "Who are you and where are you
taking Narumi?" ask Kakashi, Sakura and Sai taking defensive stands
behind him, just in case something was to happen.</P><P>Kyubi
stops laughing and looks at Kakashi with a glare, making
him shiver, tough trying to hid it Kyubi noticed and begins to laugh
again, knowing full well that the two younger ones with Kakashi are
almost ready to piss themselves. Kakashi glares at Kyubi "I asked
who are you and where are you taking Narumi?" he ask with a higher
and more demanding tone in his voice. Kyubi stops laughing again and
looks at him, bringing Narumi closer to his body holding her tighter
"<B>I think you know who I am, you and
your little students just heard it with the other person hiding only
a couple meters from our right.</B>"
Kyubi said making Kakashi, Sakura, Sai and Sasuke look surprised.
Sasuke walks out from the bushes making the others, expect Kyubi, and
look even more surprised with their eyes wide open, you would think
they will fall out soon. Sakura, being the first to get back to
reality, starts screaming "SASUKE-KUN, you have finally come back
to me, you have finally come to tell me that you love me, right?"
successfully bringing the other two back to reality and waking Narumi
from her blissful slumber, all five of them thinking they are about
to go deaf, Kyubi and Narumi more than the others because of their
over sensitive ears.</P><P>Sasuke,
after getting over his almost deaf
experience, looks at Sakura with emotionless eyes, with a little hint
of disgust, if you looked very deep in to them "No, I'm not here
because of you or to go back to that pathetic village, I ones called
a home." Sasuke said while not looking at Sakura but at Narumi, who
is now awake thanks to Sakura.</P><P>Seeing
that <I><B>her</B></I>
Sasuke-kun is not even looking at her, looks at the direction he is
looking at and lands her eyes on Narumi "YOU" Sakura screams,
ones AGAIN make everyone think they are going deaf. "It's your
fault that Sasuke-kun is ignoring me and has left the village. Why
couldn't you just have died today at this…." Sakura didn't
have change to finish the sentence, because of Kyubi punching her in
the face, making her fly 50 meters back hitting a three stopping her
fly mid ways and making her go unconscious. "<B>That
little whore does not have the right to talk about Narumi, no one of
you have</B>" Kyubi said, looking at the
other three people still standing.</P><P>Narumi,
not knowing what has happened the last 30 minutes, looks up to Kyubi
at his words, making him and the others
aware that she is awake. Kyubi looks down at Narumi, his eyes going
softer and showing love, care and happiness "<B>I
see you have woken up my little Naru-chan!</B>"
Kyubi said, with a very caring tone. Narumi nods her head with a
little blush showing on her face, not really knowing what to say and
still a little fuzzy in the head because of her blood lost from her
wounds. She then looks around, spotting the other three standing a
couple of feet away from them, looking like they have just seen a
ghost. She looks back up at Kyubi, who is still looking at her with
caring and love filled eyes "Why are they here and why are they
looking at you like that?" she ask him. Kyubi, finally shifting his
eyes from Narumi, looks at the three other people STILL standing
there "<B>Oh, you are still here! I
thought you would have left awhile ago</B>"
Kyubi said, making Kakashi, Sai, Sasuke and Narumi sweat
drop. "<I>Is he
stupid or something?</I>" was everyone's
thought at the moment.</P><P>Kyubi
looks at everyone, seeing their disbelieves in their eyes, starts
laughing. He then calms down and glares at
the three shinobis' still left in his and Narumi's way. "<B>You
know, that was me saying you should leave and not bother Narumi and
me. So why don't you go before I MAKE YOU?</B>"
Kyubi said, at the end raising his voice, while making the others,
except Narumi who is use to the voice from her head, shiver in fear
wishing they where some other place than here.</P><P>Sasuke,
getting his courage back, takes a steep forward, his back straight
and his chin high, meets Kyubi with his own glare, which is nothing
compared to Kyubi's, "I'm not leaving
without having Narumi with me. I didn't get all the way here to go
back empty handed." Sasuke said with smugness in his voice, still
thinking he will get what he wants not knowing that he is just making
Kyubi more angry and irritable then he already is.</P><P>Narumi, Kakashi and
Sai seeing this starts to back of bit, well Kakashi and Sai are,
while Narumi is still in Kyubis protectively and caring embrace,
wishing she could be where Kakashi and Sai are just this ones, not
wanting to be in reach of Kyubis wrath.</P><P>"<B>So
you won't leave with my little Naru-chan, hmm? Well that will be a
problem.</B>" Kyubi said in a low and
deep threatening voice. Sasuke, not wanting to be seen as weak, goes
up to Kyubi ignoring the threatening voice or the shake of the head
from Kakashi "Yes, that's right. And seeing you won't hand over
Narumi to me, I just have to take her with force." Sasuke said,
standing directly in front of Kyubi, few centimeters away from Narumi
and him, with him looking down at Sasuke. "<B>Yes
it looks like you have to do that. But why are you so sure you can?</B>"
Kyubi ask, not showing any kind of worry making Sasuke madder and
madder.</P><P>Without
thinking, Sasuke tries to take Narumi out of Kyubi's arms. Kyubi,
seeing and sensing what he is about to do, jumps two feet away from
him landing gracefully like a cat. Sauske, getting his footing back,
runs up to Kyubi to try it one more time and to make Kyubi fight him,
thinking he can beat him easily. Meanwhile Kakashi tries to stop
Sasuke going to his death, not really succeeding, seeing as Kyubi
has just kicked Sasuke right in his abdomen.</P><P>Seeing
that Sasuke won't give up, Kyubi takes a lazy stand, while putting
Narumi down so that she is sitting on the ground watching Sasuke
getting closer and closer to her and Kyubi "<B>You
just won't lising, well it's true what my little Naru-chan said
about you, you are a stubborn teme.</B>"
Kyubi said, just as Sasuke is few centimeters away from reaching
Narumi, he swings his right leg, kicking Sasuke in his abdomen again
making him cough out blood and barely able to stand awake.</P><P>"<B>Be
happy I didn't kill you. This is a message to you and all the other
people you know, like the Hokage and Naru-chan's so called friends.
Leave us alone, don't even try to find us or getting Naru-chan back
and away from me, I won't allow that, and you will be sure I won't
kill anyone from your people, maybe, hehehe. Got it?</B>"
Kyubi ask while looking at Kakashi and Sasuke, who is still fighting
hard, to not go unconscious. Kakashi takes a deep breath to get his
nerves again "I will tell that to our Hokage and Narumi's
friends, but I won't promise that we will do as you said."
Kakashi said, making Kyubi chuckle "<B>That's
just fine by me.</B>" Kyubi say, walking
over to Narumi and lift her up without her making any fight to stop
him.</P><P>Kakashi
sees this and can't believe his eyes "Narumi what are you doing,
Why are you not fighting against him?" Kakashi ask, disbelieve in
his voice. Narumi looks at Kakashi with cold eyes that he has never
seen on her before "Why should I fight him,
he has been more of a family and friend to me than any of you other
people I know. He has been by my side all my life and tried to help
and comfort me when I need it. No one of you has done that, and you
Kakashi has never showed any interest or worry for me before, so
don't start now." Narumi said with a cold voice and without using
sensei behind Kakashi's name, making him flinch from hurt, and
realize that what she said was true, he has been a terrible sensei
and friend to her.</P><P>Kyubi,
not wanting to wait and see what will happen next, starts to walk to
where the woods starts, then he stops and lifts his free hand up in
the air while chanting something on a different language, getting the
attention of Sasuke and Kakashi again. After what seems like forever
but really only was a few minutes, he stops his chanting and just as
he stops a portal starts to form before him
and Narumi, getting bigger and bigger, just big enough for a person
to go through.</P><P>He
then looks back at the other two shinobis' still there "<B>Bye
bye, hope we will never see each other again.</B>"
He said grinning evilly at them, he then jumps through the portal
with Narumi safely in his arms. Just as Kakashi was about to follow,
the portal close in on its self, giving Kakashi or anyone else no
chance to follow or know where they went.</P><P>Seeing
it won't help anyone by keep standing there, Kakashi takes Sasuke,
who went unconscious when Kyubi and Narumi jumped through the portal,
and throws him on his shoulder while walking over to the still
unconscious Sakura, doing the same with her. He then takes off throw
the trees towards Konaha, with Sai right
behind him (Sorry there wasn't very much from him) to report what
just happened and to get Sasuke and Sakura to the hospital to get
medical care.</P><P>None
of them knowing that a fifth person was there, seeing and hearing
everything that just happened, disappearing to where ever that
mysterious person came from.</P><P>Well
people that was the first chapter and my very first story I have ever
writing. You like? Please review and please don't be too hard it's
my first and I don't have any beta, so there might be many grammar
and spell mistakes.</P><P>If
you like, then the next chapter will answer
these questions:</P><P>Who
was the mysterious person, where did Kyubi and Narumi go to and what
will Tsunade and the others do?</P><P>All
that, you will find out in the next

I have set up, which is important for this story's story-line.</P><P>Should Itachi be:</P><P>Innocence,</P><P>Guilty to his crimes and be after Narumi and Kyubi or</P><P>Guilty to his crimes but help Narumi and Kyubi (being friends and such)</P><P>Please
vote and please review.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>IMPORTANT
AN:</B> On my profile you can now find 3
Challenges, if anyone has chosen to write one of the Challenges,
PLEASE pm me on which of the three you have chosen if more. Now that
was the Semi good news. The bad news is that I cannot write any of my
two stories anymore. I just can't seem to get the stories going. I
know that I have said that I won't abandon them, and I really don't
want that, but like I have said, I just can't get it going. Writing
is not my thing, I have tried and I'm happy for all those who liked
the first chapters from both of my stories and I have huge respect
for all the Authors who takes the time to write stories, but again it
just was not my thing.</P><P>I have many ideas in
my head for stories, but for not to this happen again, I will put
them up as Challenges as they come, hence for the three Challenges
who are now on my profile.</P><P>As
I was saying, I really don't want to abandon my two stories, so the
only thing I can do to "save" them, is to put both my stories up
for adoption. If there is someone who is interested to adopt one of
my stories, please review or pm me and tell what you want to do with
it. The only thing I will ask for to be kept is:</P><P><I><B>In
Naruto</B></I><I><B>:</B></I>
FemNaruto, MaleKyuubixFemNaruto pairing and that it will be a
crossover and that there will not be much interaction with the Naruto
universe.</P><P><I><B>In
Yugioh:</B></I> It will be about
Street-fighting, YamixAquaxYugi Pairing, have the Characters of Rose
Mistress in it (I have got permission to use them) and Anzu Bashing.</P><P>So, anyone
interested to adopt one of my stories??? And PLEASE look at my
Challenges.</P><P>Again, I'm sorry.</P><P>HikariAi</P>
