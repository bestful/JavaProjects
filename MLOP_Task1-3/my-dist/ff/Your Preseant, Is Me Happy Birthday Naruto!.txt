that's a guy, you might be disturbed… let's get on with the
story!</p><P>Hope: dude… 3… 2…
1… man…</p><P>--X--</p><P>Profile:</p><P>:-X-:</p><P>Name: Ange Masiyama</p><P>Age: 14</p><P>Hair color/length:
Black/Long, down to the waist</p><P>Eye color: Ruby</p><P>Figure: (You choose)</p><P>Cup size: (Uh… you
choose…)</p><P>Occupation: Ninja,
Chunnin</p><P>Role: For 6 months, you
dated Naruto. It's Naruto's 15 birthday, and you want to give him
a special present, you.</p><P>--X--</p><P>You were walking down
the busy streets of Konoha, leisurely strolling towards to Naruto's
favorite ramen stand. As you look around, a festival was being set up
as you walked, and noticed a banner above you. You squinted your eyes
to see what it says, and noticed in Kanji, it read 'The 15th
anniversary of the fall of the Kyuubi.' You sighed in realization
to yourself as you realize that this festival always come around once
a year today on October 10th. As you stroll closer to the
stand, you noticed that there was no mass of blonde hair, or stacks
of finished ramen bowls around, which also means that Naruto wasn't
there like he always was.</p><P>'<I>That's odd…'</I>
you thought to yourself as you sat down on one of the seats with a
sigh, <I>'He always comes here around this time…'</I></p><P>"Hello there! Welcome
back! You're Naruto's girlfriend right? How may I help you?"
Ayame from behind the counter said cheeringly towards you.</p><P>It was no secret that
you were dating Naruto and became his girlfriend. In fact, the minute
that you yelled out yes to him when he asked if you wanted to be his
girlfriend, the word spread out quickly around the village somehow.
Now people look at you with either pity, or hatred, with a few people
like the pink-haired girl you met and the teacher at the academy with
a scar over his nose looked at you with pure happiness. You didn't
even realize that he was the container of the Kyuubi, the most
powerful Demon in existence, but for you it didn't even matter
anyway. 5 months ago, as you and Naruto were strolling down a random
street, a man came up to you and told her she's a demon lover and
she was dating the Kyuubi. But you surprised him and everyone else
that was around by telling the man that you didn't care what he
was, she will always be by his side. With that said, you hospitalized
the man and took away his ability to make children.</p><P>--Flashback--</p><P><I>You and Naruto were
strolling down a street, heading towards both of your favorite
places, the Ichimaru's Ramen stand. You were on his right side with
both of your arms wrapped around his right arm, and your head was
leaning on his shoulder. You looked contempt and safe around him, and
if anyone was looking, at them, they would see a couple of lovers.
The moment was ruined however as a man staggered up to them with a
sake bottle in his hand and a noticed a distinct smell of alcohol in
the air around him. You noticed right then and there, that he was
drunk.</I></p><P>"<I>Hey you there
girl! Why the hell are you with the demon!" the man yelled to you
drunkenly as he swayed a little, "Why are you with the Kyuubi!
Unless. I knew it! You're a demon-lover!"</I></p><P>"<I>Kyuubi?" you
repeated, surprised at the man's action in his drunken state. You
glance at Naruto, who looked down with sadness and his bangs over his
eyes.</I></p><P>"<I>Hey you demon!"
The man turned towards your boyfriend who flinched back, "Why won't
you and your whore get the fuck out of the village already! No demons
or demon-whores allowed!"</I></p><P><I>You growled in anger
at the man, who took a step back from fear away you, 'How dare he
call HER Naruto a demon!' she didn't care about the demon-whore
part, she was too pissed at the man to even care and only cared about
how he insulted HER Naruto.</I></p><P><I>The man recovered
quickly and put his bravado back on, "Ha! Can't stand the fact
he's the Kyuubi can you! Can't stand the fact that he is a
bloodthirsty monster who doesn't care about you huh!?! I thought as
much!"</I></p><P>"<I>So…?" you
replied softly as you lowered your head, "So… do I care?"</I></p><P><I>Naruto and the man
looked at you in surprise. She didn't care?</I></p><P>"<I>What the hell did
you say?"</I></p><P>"<I>Do I care if he's
the Kyuubi?" You looked up to the man, who was a little fearful of
you, "Do I care if he's a monster? Am I supposed to care? Take a
good at him! Does he even look like a monster? If he really was the
Kyuubi, he would have destroyed the village by now! He's not the
demon! He's the man I love! He's the one and only Naruto Uzumaki,
the next Hokage!"</I></p><P><I>Now, to say that the
people around her were surprised would be an understatement. The
looks on their faces were priceless. Some of them looked like they
were changing their views about him. You glanced back at Naruto and
noticed that he was genuinely surprised, with a hint of happiness.</I></p><P>"<I>Do… do you
really mean that Ange-chan?" Naruto asked you with a little hope in
his eyes.</I></p><P><I>You just smiled at
him sincerely, "Of course Naruto-koi. I wouldn't have said all
that if I didn't mean it. I love you Naruto-koi, and I would be
damned if anyone tried to prevent me from doing so…" </I></p><P><I>You emphasized your
point by cupping his face, leaning over and give him a passionate
kiss, adding you tongue, that lasted for over a minute. Almost halve
of the crowd watching softened their expression. Hell, they even
clapped for you. After disconnecting the kiss from a surprised and
glazed over Naruto, you looked back at the man who was agape and
dropped his sake bottle that shattered on contact with the ground.</I></p><P>"<I>Wa- wha?"</I></p><P>"<I>And now…" You
said to the man with an evil smirk and pulled out a rusty knife from
out of nowhere as you walked towards the man, "What to do with
you…"</I></p><P>"<I>Wa-what the hell
are you doing! Get back, no! Stop! Ge-get away you- you demon-lover!
No! Wait! AAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!!"</I></p><P>--End Flashback--</p><P>No one had the guts to
mess with you ever since, especially the male population. The man was
hospitalized, and was missing a few important parts for a guy. That
was a good reason for men to stay away from them. The nice old man
and the girl at the ramen stand were nicer to you, if that was even
humanly possible, than before ever since. Ayame even became your one
best friend, which added to the many friends you have already like
the shy Hyuuga girl and the girl with a lot of weapons. But you
forgot their names though…</p><P>"Hey, Ayame-chan,
where's Naruto-koi? Doesn't he usually come here around this
time?" you ask. You were planning to take him to the hot springs
today, mixed bath of course.</p><P>"Oh… today is the
festival of the defeat of Kyuubi…" Ayame replied sadly, "Which
is also his birthday…"</p><P>Of course! How can you
forget? Today was the celebration of the supposed defeat of the
Kyuubi. Of course tough, you and a few other people know the real
truth.</p><P>"He usually doesn't
come around inside the village because of the festival… so he can't
come back to his house until dark since people like to vandalize it…"</p><P>You lowered your head
as realization struck you. Apparently, there are still ignorant
villagers out there who still think that Naruto is the demon, not the
container. She couldn't blame them though, since they lost their
families and were blinded by their own hate of the Kyuubi, although
the Kyuubi can't do any harm to people anymore but are still too
ignorant to believe it. On second thought, you can blame them.</p><P>"Tell you a secret
though," Ayame whispered to her as she leaned in towards you,
"Naruto is usually out to the training fields and doesn't come
back until dark. So you still have some time until them to surprise
him."</p><P>"Surprise him?" you
ask, "What can I surprise him with?"</p><P>"Well… you love him
right?"</p><P>"Right…"</p><P>"And you want to be
by his side forever right?"</p><P>"Right…"</p><P>"So figure it out!
I'll even help you if you want?" Ayame finished in her usual
cheery voice.</p><P>"But what am I going
to-"you stop as one thought for his present crossed your mind.
Although, it's a little… provocative, you can't help but agree
with it. You love Naruto enough to give him everything, your life,
your love, and your heart. You would give him everything, including
that. You hesitated for a minute and finally made a decision.</p><P>"So, you thought
about it?"</p><P>"Yes. And I think I
do need your help. Do you have any red ribbon on you?" you asked
embarrassingly with a blush that only you can understand… <I>'Naruto,
this is a birthday you will never forget!'</I></p><P>-x-</p><P>Naruto was in the
training fields practicing his ninjutsu. He was panting lightly and
looked slightly nervous. He would be since that today is his
birthday. A day that is usually for celebration, rejoice for growing
older. Naruto hated this day since he got the exact opposite from the
village.</p><P>"<I><B>Hey kit, it's
getting dark. We should go now,"</B></I> a demonic, yet feminine
voice in his head said to him.</p><P>"Alright Kyu-chan,"
Naruto found out that Kyuubi was a girl during his training trip with
Jaraiya. He was surprised since the dark and demonic voice threw him
off. At first, his reaction was to laugh his ass off since the 'all
mighty' Kyuubi is a girl, which promptly left his with several
bruises on his head, then his second reaction was joy. They got to
know each other more, and the Kyuubi even volunteered to teach him
sexual education and even transformed herself into her human form to
show him, which left him twitching on the floor and blood gushing
from his nose afterwards.</p><P>"<B>Hey kit…"</B>
Kyuubi asked timidly, unlike what people imagine for a powerful demon
vixen like her, "What do you think of that… Ange girl…
honestly…"</p><P>"Uh… well she's
my girlfriend as she's very kind to me… hey, what's this all of
a sudden? Why-" Naruto thought of something and smirked, "Hey,
wait a minute, is the big, mean, and powerful demon of all time…
jealous?" He was met with silence, "Oh my God! You are jealous
aren't you? That is so rich!" Naruto felt a splitting headache
and held his head in pain.</p><P>"<B>First off, never
insult me insolent brat, or did you forget that I could give you a
migraine! Second, never mess with a woman's feelings! Even if I was
jealous, which I'm not, it's not good to rub it in, or else
you'll be in a whole lot of pain!"</B></p><P>"Ok! Ok! I get the
point! Stop already!" Naruto felt his headache disappear and
stopped holding his head, "Jeez… didn't need to go that far…"</p><P>"<B>Just shut up and
head home already!"</B></p><P>"Ok! Damn…"</p><P>-x-</p><P>You reached Naruto's
apartment. You were wearing a backpack and got a spare key from it.
She opened the door and went inside the dark apartment, closing the
door behind her.</p><P>"Alright… I only
got a few minute to prepare… God I'm so nervous… Naruto-koi,
this is for you…" you said as you pulled out a roll of red ribbon
from the backpack.</p><P>-x-</p><P>A few minutes later,
Naruto reached the outside of his apartment. He unlocked the door and
felt something off for a minute. He shrugged it off and when he went
in, he was met with, candles?</p><P>"What the heck?"</p><P>He looked around his
apartment and noticed there were lit red candles around his small
apartment.</p><P>"Who did this? What's
going on?"</p><P>-x-</p><P>You heard the sound of
the door opening. You were in Naruto's room and finished the last
of your work.</p><P>"It's show time…"
you whispered as you climbed on Naruto's bed and laid down on your
back, waiting.</p><P>-x-</p><P>Naruto checked the rest
of the room he was in and found nothing out of the ordinary, except
the red candle. The only room he didn't check was his own bedroom.
He cautiously crept over to the door and grabbed the knob. He slowly
turned it and peered inside. What he met, was what he didn't
expect.</p><P>-x-</p><P>"Wa-wha?" You heard
Naruto mumble and saw the blush on his face.</p><P>"Hello Naruto-koi…"
you replied back in a soft voice with a blush of your own, "happy
birthday…"</p><P>"Huh?" was your
boyfriend's intelligent reply.</p><P>You giggled at him.
Sometimes, he was too cute, "Today's your birthday Naruto-koi…"</p><P>You stared at him as he
looked over your body. You were naked, but not completely. The only
thing that covered you was a long strand of silky red ribbon covering
you. The only parts it covered were breast and your private parts
below. The rest were loosely wrapped around your arms and legs ending
with a pretty bow on your wrist and ankles. Your arms were on either
side of you with your arms near your shoulder. To complete the
illusion, you were blushing cutely and your legs were tied together
with another set of ribbons in a big bow.</p><P>"My… my birthday?"
he hesitated to say as he took a double take on you again. You would
have sworn he said 'gorgeous' under his breath as he studied your
body, "Wa-what's my present?" he asked nervously, almost if he
already knew the answer.</p><P>"Your present…"
you said to Naruto in a lusting and sensual voice as he studies your
seductively wrapped body, "is me…"</p><P>"I-it's you?" he
asked timidly as he went over to the bed.</p><P>"Yes Naruto-koi…
it's me… I want you to do whatever you want with me…" you
whispered to him as he climbed on the bed, and watched him remove his
jacket and shirt, revealing his well-toned body, "I am your present
after all…"</p><P>"But what if you
regret this?" he said again as he climbed onto you, now
face-to-face with him, "What if you think this'll be a mistake
later on?"</p><P>"Naruto-koi, if I had
second thoughts, I wouldn't do this… you know how much I love
you, and even though we only just dated for 6 months, I believe that
it's time to take or relationship to the next level…" you
paused to check if he was listening, "Naruto-koi… I don't want
any other man in my life… I know we're still young but… I want
you to make me yours… I want to be with you… to be by your side…
Naruto-koi… I love you…"</p><P>Naruto looked
surprised. Sure, you said that you love him a lot of times back then,
but this time, you're proving it. With everything that you did,
everything that you said 5 months ago, you backed up your words, and
still backed up you words. But with all words aside, Naruto has one
goal in mind right now. To make you his.</p><P>Naruto first locked
lips with you, a deep and passionate one. You felt him play with your
bottom lip, begging for entrance, which you gladly gave him. You felt
his tongue enter your mouth and explore. His tongue battled yours for
domination, which you lost. Badly. His body shift as he trailed his
fingers down your body that made shivers go down your spine to the
sensation. He tugged at the big ribbon that was tied around your legs
and unwrap it, freeing your legs, and his present. His fingers ran
back up, while he's was still locking tongues with you, and stopped
on your breast. You moaned softly as his fingers went under the
ribbon and slowly massage your breast. He took two fingers and rubbed
your hardened tits with it, moaning in his mouth as he continued the
sensual treatment. He stopped kissing you, and you whimpered and
pouted from the lost of contact, but started moaning again as he
lifted the cover of the other breast and licked it.</p><P>"Mmm… Naruto-koi…"</p><P>With renewed vigor, he
trailed butterfly kisses down your body starting from your neck… he
kissed both of your breast… your belly button, which caused you to
giggle lightly as it tickled, and even down more… you watched him
as he removed the silky ribbon that separated you, from your wet sex.
He licked the outside of your sex, causing you to gasp, as you never
felt anything lie this before, and slowly turned into a moan as he
continued to eat you out. He took his free hand and pinched you clit.</p><P>"Aaahh!" you
exclaimed as you orgasmed from the contact, the very first you had in
your life.</p><P>You saw him smirk in a
victory as he continued to finger you. After several minutes of
foreplay, he decided it was enough torture. He removed the rest of
the ribbons from your lower waist, included the ones around your
ankles. He spread your legs apart and took off his pants, revealing
his hardened member to you. He positioned himself at you entrance,
and glanced back at you in concern.</p><P>"Yes Naruto-koi…
take me… make me yours…" you whisper to him lovingly.</p><P>He nodded and thrust
slowly into you. You bit your lip as your walls were forcefully
expanding from a foreign object. You felt him hit the wall and slowly
penetrate it, causing you to gasp in pain. He stopped and waited for
you to signal him to keep going. After 5 minutes, the pain went away
and nodded to him to keep going. He slowly went in and out of you,
you moaned in bliss and extreme pleasure as he continued to make love
to you.</p><P>"Faster…"</p><P>He complied as he
thrust deeper and harder into you. You moaned even louder as he hit
your G-spot and made you orgasm, but continued.</p><P>"Faster…"</p><P>He went faster again,
with the wet and slick wall helped. You thrust your movements against
his as he spread your legs as farther and went even deeper. He gave
an animalistic roar that sent you over the edge. You cried out his
name as he hit the spot that gave you more pleasure. You felt him
stiffen, and you felt something welding up in you again. You wrapped
your legs around his waist and put your arms around his neck. With
one last thrust, both of you cried out each other's name.</p><P>"Naruto-koi!"</p><P>"Ange-chan!"</p><P>You both orgasmed and
felt his cum inside you leaking out. Both of you were panting hard,
as Naruto laid on top of you. He put his arms around your waist and
you wrapped your arms around his neck. You kissed each other one last
time before the dreamland claimed you both.</p><P>"Happy birthday…
Naruto-koi…"</p><P>"Happy birthday…
Ange-chan…"</p><P>The vixen in Naruto's
head giggled lightly as she watched over the two lovers sleep in each
other's arms. She gave a contempt sigh and smiled.</p><P>"<B>Happy birthday
kit…"</B></p><P>--X--</p><P>AJ: T.T so happy…</p><P>Ashly: Sniff… they
look so good together…</p><P>Rock: hn… shouldn't
you update your other story?</p><P>AJ: shouldn't you go
off and spend time with Lily?</p><P>Rock: you are going to
fucking die now…</p><P>Andrew: please read and
review. We'll update "He Is My Master, Naruto!" later.</p>
