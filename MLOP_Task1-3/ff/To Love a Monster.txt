I don't even own the plot! It was all the brilliant KCameh's idea, sigh.</p><p>Warnings: This story will eventually be a Yaoi, which means boy on boy. So if are going to be offend and a yell at me, please save us both and use the little button on your browsers that takes you back, I believe it's called the <i>back button.</i><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>What is love? What are the limits that define it? Can a monster be taught to love? Can you love a monster? I long to know and to feel love. I have had containers before, so many before. Their deaths meant no more to me then their lives. This container is different, I feel bound to him not sealed in him. I feel as though if I could leave and be free I would chose to stay. What sin did this angel commit to be chained to me? A demon; a murder who soul is stained with the blood of entire villages. For him I would die, for him I will live.<hr size=1 width=100% noshade>The soft whisk of leaves was the only evidence of their passage, yet was enough to give them away. Like shadows they raced across the forest homeward bound, unaware of the danger that traced their movements. With a soft breath the breeze picked up and a tossed the sent of the pursuers into the nose of one of those they hunted. He paused crouching on a branch listening, watching, and smelling. The three younger travels also paused, heads cocked intent on the older man.</p><p>"What is it sensei?" The girl asked. Her eyes traced the forest, but found nothing out of place.</p><p>"We're being followed." He said, his voice belied no emotion and his face veiled, save for a single eye, gave no hint to his feelings either. His juniors froze, their every senses straining for some hint of their hunters.</p><p>"Who?" One of the boys asked, his blank face served as just effective a mask as the man's cloth covering. The man's eye danced towards the forth member of their party and back to the boy who asked.</p><p>"Akatsuki." The tense that filled the air at that single word seemed to prick their skin. Worry danced across the girls face.</p><p>"They can't…" She trailed off, fear taking root in her heart as she glance at the blonde on the branch beside her.</p><p>"They must." The masked man said simply. If he shared the girl's fear, nothing in his demeanor gave him away. Further conversation was cut off as the hurter caught up to its prey. He came on wings; the air stirring as his mount landed, the perfect symmetry of the bird and the long blonde hair concealing the riders face tugged at the blonde boy's memory.</p><p>"You tried to kill Gaara!" He shouted lunging forward. A hand raised by the masked man stopped him.</p><p>"Did I? You know I don't really pay attention names, yeah." The hunter's face feigned concentration.</p><p>"Bastard! You're going to pay for what you did to Gaara." The boy leaped and this time his sensei's hand wasn't enough to stop him.</p><p>"Naruto!" His sensei snapped, reaching out to grab the back of the boy's shirt.</p><p>"Kakashi-sensei he's Akatsuki and he tried to kill Gaara!" Naruto shouted frustration putting an almost whinny edge to his voice. The man in question chuckled, and then his face light up in mock delight.</p><p>"Oh you mean the Jinchuuriki. You're one too, yeah." The blonde man's hands moved lightly as he spoke, and Kakashi one eye followed; wary of the seemingly harmless clay being molded in the other's hands. Carefully Kakashi raised his hand to push aside the forehead covering that hid his eye.</p><p>"Too late, yeah." The hunter murmured as he tossed the clay figurine at the travelers.</p><p>"Run!" Kakashi shouted. The group seemed to remain frozen for a moment before the explosion ripped the forest apart sending the party flying. Naruto landed hard against a tree, the air coming out of him in a sudden whoosh. For a few terrifying moment he lay unable to re-inflate his lungs and a loud ringing filled his ears. When the boy was finally able to sit up and look around, he couldn't see his teammates anywhere. As hard as his eyes searched a desecrated forest was all he could see. Movement caught the corner of his eye and he spun coming face to face with a stranger whose entire face was cover by an orange mask. Naruto wrinkled his nose in confusion, why hadn't he heard the new comer's approach. Suddenly the masked mans hands began to form seals and Naruto watch entranced for a moment before realizing the potential danger. He opened his mouth to ask what the man was doing, but he could hear no sound come out. In horror he raised his hand to his throat, the man in front of finished his seal and a ripple of air stuck Naruto in the chest. A pain like none he'd ever felt before ripped through his body and he threw his head back, a soundless scream tore from his throat. It felt like something was inside him destroying him. The pain that mounted was choking and his vision began to blur, but before he blacked out entirely Naruto could have sworn he saw something red towering above him.<hr size=1 width=100% noshade></p><p>AN: This story is dedicated to KCameh, who not only requested it, but also is basically responsible for the plot. As I said in the warning this will eventually be a Yaoi I promise! You'll just have to be patient! Chapter 2 will be up next Sunday!</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer: I still don't own anything in the Naruto world, though
I do own a quiche.</p><P>Warning: Incase you failed to read the last warning this story will
get around to being Yaoi, KyuuNaru for those that care to know. I can
now safely say that it won't be till Ch 5. So if you wish to
keep reading, even though you hate Yaoi, knock yourself out!</p><P>I am floating in a dark water filled hall, I've been here before.
I stand and begin to slosh through the water my breath echoing
against the walls egging me on till I'm running. I dash around
corners, my feet slipping on the water covered floor. I'm
searching, searching, and not finding. Where is he? It's always
been so easy to find him before. Finally I come to his chamber, what
I find cause my breath to catch and my heart to freeze. The room is
empty and the tall gates stand ajar. My hand brushes the torn seal
and disbelief fills me. He's gone, but gone where?</p><P>A
young man stood above the crumpled form of Naruto, he was moving his
long figures in pure fascination. Now that black cloaked little
nuisance was out of the way he was free to explore this new body of
his own making, and of course to examine the object of his
infatuation that lay so conveniently at his feet. With a sweeping
movement he was kneeling at his blonde angel's side. His warm hands
traced Naruto face, and a smile tugged at his pale lips.</p><P>"Get away from him!"
A female voice shouted and the man's eyes flickered towards an
angry girl with pink hair.</p><P>"As you wish, I
simply wanted to insure that he was alive." The man's voice was
smooth and deep. The pink haired girl eyed the stranger standing
before her, he was amazingly handsome with red-gold hair pulled into
a messy ponytail on the back of his head, his eyes were dark, but as
the sun caught then they seemed to glimmer red, and his skin was as
pale as a clean scroll.</p><P>"Who are you?" The
girl demanded as she approached her fallen friend. The handsome
stranger seemed to pause for a moment, as though unsure of how to
answer.</p><P>"My name is Kuro,
who are you?" His answer seemed less certain then it could have
been.</p><P>"My name is Sakura.
What are you doing so close to the leaf village?" She asked as she
moved her hands down Naruto checking for any major wounds.</p><P>"He's fine, I
already checked. I was unaware that I was near any villages; I'm
not from around here. I only came because I heard an explosion and
wanted to see if I could help." Kuro shrugged. Sakura appraised him
again, he didn't look dressed for travel, but before she could
press the issue the rest of her team appeared.</p><P>"Sakura who is
this?" Kakashi asked, eyeing Kuro suspiciously with his Sharingan,
his chakra looked very familiar.</p><P>"He says his name is
Kuro and that he heard the explosion and came to see if he could
help." She said, her voice said she didn't believe a word the man
had told her. Kakashi however just nodded, as if this where
completely expected.</p><P>"And Naruto?" The
littlest traces of worry seemed to lace Kakashi's voice. Sakura bit
her lip and threw a glance at Kuro.</p><P>"Everything seems to
be fine, Kakashi-sensei." There seemed to be something left unsaid,
something that Sakura was reluctant to mention in front of Kuro.
Kakashi nodded and the dark haired boy next to him spoke up.</p><P>"We should get back
to Konoha." His voice was soft and unemotional, almost as if his
fallen comrade meant nothing to him. Sakura nodded and Kakashi bent
to pick up Naruto.</p><P>"Kuro you don't
look equipped to be traveling. Why don't you come back to Konoha
with us?" Sakura met Kakashi eyes and gave a slight nod. The boy
standing next to Kakashi opened his mouth to say something.</p><P>"I think that's a
good idea Kakashi-sensei. Don't you Sai?" She gave the boy a hard
look and Sai shut his mouth and looked indifferent.</p><P>The group made their
way to Konoha. Kakashi and Sai didn't seem worried about the
Akatsuki so Sakura made no move to bring them up. She did notice that
Kuro seemed to avoid Sai, but Sai wasn't a very friendly person so
she brushed it aside. They didn't stop till Naruto started to shift
in Kakashi's arms.</p><P>"Where are we? When
did the sound come back?" Naruto muttered wiggling so that Kakashi
almost dropped him. The group paused to lay Naruto on the forest
floor and Sakura moved to examine him again.</p><P>"Your loss in
hearing was most likely caused by being so close to the explosion.
Are you feeling ok?" She asked her hands glowing as she moved them
down his body. He shifted and made a face.</p><P>"I feel odd…empty."
Naruto seemed unsure of how to describe the feeling which odd because
the young man was never unsure of anything.</p><P>"Nothing a bowl of
Ramen won't fix!" Sakura said smiling too brightly.</p><P>"Idiot." Sai
stated calmly, it was unclear which of his team mates he was talking
to, though he seemed to feel the sentiment applied to both of them.</p><P>"Hey, whose he?"
Naruto questioned when he became aware of Kuro. Sai turned to look at
Kuro.</p><P>"Sakura says that he
says his name is Kuro." Naruto eyed the red-hair man in front of
him.</p><P>"Were did he come
from?" The blonde demanded, at this the other three in the team
shrugged and turned to stare at Kuro.</p><P>"I…" Kuro bit
his lip and looked embarrassed, "I don't really have a home."
He hung his head, ashamed.</p><P>"So you're a
missing-nin?" He pressed. The others gave him an odd look; Naruto
normally was very trusting and open to new people. Again Kuro looked
uncomfortable and sifted under Naruto's clear blue gaze.</p><P>"No. I never really
had a village." Kuro seemed to very upset by this, Naruto sniffed
and glared in obvious disbelief. Kakashi glanced at the sky.</p><P>"We're not going
to make it back to Konoha tonight. Why don't we make camp here?"
The team nodded and began to lay out their bedding on the forest
floor. As he looked for a place with out rocks Sakura could have
sworn she heard Naruto mutter,</p><P>"I miss Yamato." She smiled; she too missed the man's ability
to raises a house in a few seconds. It was apparent that despite
being a wander Kuro had no bedding, however when they offered share
some blankets with him he waved it off. As Naruto shifted trying to
get comfortable he couldn't help but feel that someone was
watching. Indeed when he turned to look, he could have sworn he saw
to red eyes glowing out of the darkness.</p><P>AN: Yeah Ch 2! Happiness! Sorry for the lateness, but fanfiction
wouldn't upload anything for me. So I have decided that
standardized testing is a waste of time and money. And that the
retards that write the questions don't care about what you know
they only care about wither or not you pay attention to the
intrusions and work well under a time limit. And the stupid freaks
think that 30 min is enough time to write a full developed, edit
paper on something you've most likely never though of before! So
anyway now that my ACT induced rant is over I hope you enjoyed this
chapter. Chapter 3 will be posted April 22-ish.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p>Disclaimer: I still don't own Naruto or anything related to Naruto. I am making no money off this story. Blah, blah, blah boring legal crap.</p><p>WARNING: Guess what this story is still going to be a Yaoi! Gasp! Don't worry it won't be till chapter 4, yeah I know I said 5 last time but it changed, so you can keep ignoring me for another whole chapter if the idea of boy on boy offends you.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>I love to watch him like this, his chest rising and falling with each breath. When I first got out I thought that my attraction to this boy would soon fade. However, the longer I spend free of him to more I long to be with him in a different way. His bright blue eyes are so alive, so fierce and his hair seemed to be charged with energy. I long to touch him again, but fear of waking him stays my hand. For now I must be content to watch, but watch and wait till I have his trust.<hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Silence is second nature to a ninja, but even the members of Team Kakashi were surprised when the remainder of the trip home was silent. The normally talkative Naruto seemed withdrawn and wary. The quite that they had all longed for now set them on edge. Kuro could feel the tension is the group and chose to remain silent as well, even though he was dying to speak with the blonde ninja running not far in front of him. As they entered Konoha along with Kuro they received odd looks. It was not uncommon to see prisoners brought back from a mission, but Kuro walking freely behind Naruto was obviously not a prisoner.

<p>"Come on Kakashi-sensei, we are going to drop of the mission report now so that Tsunade-sama doesn't get angry." Sakura commanded then she turned to the other three, "There is no need for us all to come, why don't you go get some ramen?" She smiled and made shooing motions till the boys shuffled off. She stood watching them go then she grabbed Kakashi's arm and towed him off towards the Hokage Tower.</p><p>The Hokage sat with her head in her hands.</p><p>"Are you sure?" She asked glancing at the two ninja who stood in her office. The girl nodded.</p><p>"When I was examining him I noticed that the seal was disrupted and I couldn't find any of Kyuubi's chakra." The Hokage's eyes traveled to the white haired man.</p><p>"And you are certain you did make a mistake?" The man shrugged.</p><p>"Hokage-sama the Sharingan doesn't make mistakes." The woman shut her light brown eyes as she massaged her temples.</p><p>"I haven't had enough Sake to deal with this." She muttered and then added in a clearer voice, "We will try to pass him off as a self-taught ninja, the elders let Kurenai in I don't see why they wouldn't let him in and that way he stays in the village where we can watch him." The two nodded. "Shizune!" The Hokage called.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama?" The young woman asked as she entered the room, clasping a little pig in her arms.</p><p>"Go find the boy named Kuro that came in with these two. He should be eating ramen with Naruto and Sai." Shizune nodded, too use to the Hokage's weird orders to question this one, and left. Tsunade turned to the two left in her office.</p><p>"You aren't aloud to tell anyone what you have just told me. Is that understood?" The two nodded, it was very clear that this wasn't something the world needed to know.</p><p>"Tsunade-sama, what about Naruto, and Sai?" The girl asked. The Hokage seemed to consider it for a moment.</p><p>"I don't trust Sai, and there need to tell Naruto it will only upset him. Dismissed." With a nodded the two turned and left the tower. Tsunade sighed and laid her head down on her desk this was not what she had wanted to deal with.</p><p>Kuro followed behind the strange pig lady who said the Hokage wanted to see him. He wrinkled his nose the last time he'd dealt with a Hokage it hadn't turned out well for him. The door opened to revealing a youthful looking woman with pigtails leaning back in her chair behind the Hokage's desk.</p><p>"This is Kuro Tsunade-sama." The woman opened her eyes and fixed Kuro with an intense stare.</p><p>"Thank-you Shizune." She said without ever taking her eyes off Kuro. Shizune moved to stand by the door; as she walked past Kuro the pig in her arms glared, as hard a pigs can glare, at him.</p><p>"Kakashi and Sakura tell you have no village; I would like to offer you a place as a ninja in Konoha." The Hokage said. Kuro gave her an uncertain look, he couldn't tell what this woman was up to; but he could see she was no fool. "Of coarse you'll have to go before the elders, and they aren't very agreeable people, but you should be fine." The woman's voice dared the man to decline her offer.</p><p>"I would like very much to have a village to call my home. Thank-you for your generous offer, Hokage-sama." Kuro said inclining his head.</p><p>"Shizune! Have Izumo and Kotetsu go tell the Elders that I would like to see them." Shizune turned at and left.</p><p>"Good luck Kuro." The Hokage said and as she moved to face the window Kuro heard her say softly, "You'll need it."</p><p>Kuro stood before two old ninjas, their faces worn and hardened by the years of war and conflict.</p><p>"The Hokage tells us you wish to become a ninja of Konoha, she was however rather unclear where you from." The old woman asked her voice still strong despite the years of use.</p><p>"I've never had a village." Kuro said calmly staring a spot above the elders' heads, he seem determined not to look at them. The old woman raised her eyebrow.</p><p>"Yet you are a ninja?" She asked doing nothing to mask the doubt within her voice. Kuro bit his lip and then took a deep breath.</p><p>"When you have no village you must learn to fight quickly; the weak don't survive long on their own." Kuro's voice was flat and cold and the elders' exchanged mirror looks.</p><p>"Konoha lacks forces Koharu; surely can see the benefit of allowing a young ninja to join us." Tsunade said she sat on a coach not far behind Kuro.</p><p>"Ninja, yes, but this young man is no such thing." The man said his stern face looked as though it had long since forgotten how to smile.</p><p>"Then test him, Homura, you'll see that he is just as much a ninja as anyone who has been formally trained." Tsunade challenged. Homura and Koharu exchanged a long look; Koharu gave a heavy sigh and nodded.</p><p>"The Hokage is right; we are in need of ninja." She consented. Homura's frown deepened considerably.</p><p>"Kuro may become a ninja of Konoha," Kuro's face brightened and he dared to look at the elders, "If he can survive in the Forest of Death for a week with only one ninja to help him." Kuro appeared unconcerned by the man's commandment.</p><p>"That's reasonable, if the ninja if the ninja is Naruto." Tsunade said.</p><p>"Why Naruto?" Koharu questioned her beady eyes fixed on the Hokage.</p><p>"It would prove dangerous for both Kuro and the ninja sent in if they were not familiar with each other and out of the four ninja that Kuro knows Naruto is the easiest to get along with. Beside Sakura is still in training and I need to spend some time working with her, there is a mission that we agreed would be best suited for Kakashi, and I'm sure that Danzo will have need of Sai seeing as he has been gone for so long." The elders glared at Tsunade for a long moment before consenting. With business concluded the Hokage and the Elders seemed eager to be away from each other so the meeting was quickly ended.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>AN: Yay for Izumo and Kotetsu even if they weren't actually in the chapter they still kick ass! So I was in class the other day and somebody said ocean, apparently if you say ocean at just the right sped with just the right accent it sounds like "oh shit", just a brief insight into my completely twisted mind. So anyway I hope you like the chapter, and as always I enjoyed writing for you! The next chapter will be up next Sunday or Saturday-ish.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p>DISCLAIMER: I don't own any of this! Really truly I don't! And if you think that I'm making any money of this then I would inquire what drugs you're on.</p><p>WARNING: This, my dear readers, is the Yaoi chapter of doom I have been warning all about from the very beginning. This is also the chapter from which the rating heralds. It is not, however, a lemon so don't get your hopes up. I won't even bother telling you to turn back, as you obviously haven't listened yet, but you aren't aloud to say I didn't warn you!</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>This stranger worries me, and yet he fascinates me. The way he moves, it's unearthly. I am careful to avoid his eyes for fear of being trapped with in them; they are deep wells leading to a fathomless soul. I can't help but watch him when he's not looking. He is beauty incarnate and I am held spell bound. Yet, through all this I am wary of him. He is so familiar like a dream that soon after waking retreats beyond recall. He is dangerous though, my half a memory lends me that much insight. But what is beauty if it has no depth? I am intrigued as much by the fact that my instincts tell me to run as I am by his unmatched beauty. I long to throw caution to the wind and investigate this alluring individual, but the overwhelm sense of danger keeps me at bay. I will, for now, watch and see for myself how much of a threat he really is.<hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Kuro smiled as he packed the things Kakashi had loaned him into a bag. Despite its daunting name he was looking forward to his stay in the Forest of Death, though that might have had something to do with who he was spending it with. His smile widen as he thought of his chosen companion. Yes this next week promised to be filled with excitement.</p><p>Across Konoha a grumpy Naruto threw his things in his bag; the last thing he wanted to do was spend a week with Kuro. The strange handsome boy set Naruto on edge. There was something annoyingly familiar about him and Naruto didn't like it.</p><p>It wasn't only his traveling partner that worried him, but the forest itself was fraying Naruto's nerves. Try as he might he couldn't suppress the memory of the last time he'd been in there, and Orochimaru painted face kept dancing before his eyes. On top of everything the empty feeling in the pit of his stomach had been growing, despite the ramen Sakura had advised him to eat. He snarled and clipped his bag shut; not bothering to check that he had everything before leaving his tiny home.</p><p>There were only three people at the gate when Naruto arrived, but it was obvious that everyone was there. Kuro, his red hair blazing in the morning sunlight, Tsunade, looking sterner then normal, and Shizune, looking worried as she clasped her little pig in her arms. All four sets of eyes clasped on Naruto as he arrived.</p><p>"Are you ready?" Tsunade asked. Naruto nodded something seemed to weighing on normal bubbly young man. "You two must spend a week in the forest to pass the test. However, should you need help at anytime just open this scroll. Opening the scroll will mean you fail, but it could save your life. If you pass Kuro will become a ninja of Konoha and Naruto, after speaking with the Elders, we have decided that you will become a Chuunin." At this the blonde's face light up and he seemed on the verge of crying out when the Hokage cut him short, "Are there any question?"</p><p>"Will I really be made a Chuunin?" Naruto asked his eager self showing through despite his determination to be sulky. Tsunade rolled her eyes and nodded ignoring Naruto's cry of delight.</p><p>"If there are no more questions you may begin." The gate flew open and in an orange flash Naruto dashed inside, Kuro shouldered his bag a quickly followed. Tsunade watched them go.</p><p>"Be careful Naruto; the forest may be safer then your companion."</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>The dappled light of the forest casts shadows on his lovely face and darkens even his electric yellow hair. The gathering dusk and the creeping chill have done nothing to cool his attitude; he remains just as energetic as when we entered this forest. The forest around us is alive. I can feel how sinister it is and I can tell that despite his jubilant façade that the forest sets him on edge. I smirk, the setting is perfect, and finally I'll get what I've been waiting for. There is nothing and no one to stop me now; just me and him. Yes, my waiting will pay off at last.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>The Forest of Death seemed to being growing more and more hostile as the night laid its icy blanket on the ancient trees, and the forest's unwanted intrudes felt the enmity it held for all thing that did not belong. As all animals accustomed to the comforts of a group do when threatened the two travels moved closer together, and the musty forest seemed to press in on all sides egger to be rid of the brave fools who dared disturb its rest.</p><p>Naruto felt the coward within him, that he'd thought he'd put to death, stir sending a paralyzing feeling of fear throughout his body. This fear had forced his senses so acutely on forest around him he failed to notice Kuro till the other man had his hand on Naruto's shoulder. With a start that nearly sent them both hurling from the tree tops to the forest floor below Naruto spun around, his blue eyes wild.</p><p>"Why don't we find somewhere to make camp? I don't want to be traveling the forest in the dark." Kuro spoke in a hushed tone as though afraid that the very trees had ears. Naruto nodded, unsure of his voice so soon after the fright.</p><p>The two young men found a tree so old that a single one of its branches, while looming high above the ground, was a wide as one of the village's streets. In unspoken agreement they stopped. The branch was an ideal place to sleep, high above the unspoken dangers of the forest floor and below the unseen predators of above. Silence presided until the ninja began to unpack their bedding.</p><p>"I forgot my bedding!" Naruto cried in anguish; the night was cold and blankets would be needed to keep warm. Kuro smirked, his face masked by dark shadows.</p><p>"We can light a fire; it will give us warmth and should keep away some of the wild animals." Kuro said calmly, he knew it was much to damp to keep a fire a going for long as there would be nothing to burn when their kindling ran out. Naruto dug through his bag till he found the necessary equipment to light a small fire; Kuro contented himself to lean against the tree's huge trunk and watch with barely concealed desire as the blonde worked. Despite his best efforts Naruto repeatedly failed to get even the smallest of sparks to appear.</p><p>"It won't work!" Naruto cried in frustration. Kuro smiled a moved with serpentine grace to stand behind the frustrated young man.</p><p>"It will; you're just doing it wrong. You have to hold the lighters like this." Kuro voice was melted chocolate, warm, rich, and smooth. Coyly he rapped his arms around Naruto waist and guided the other man's hands to light the fire. Naruto, however, had forgotten the fire, his own checks set ablaze by the close proximity of his beautiful companion.</p><p>"See." Kuro's warm lips brushed against Naruto's icy ear and set a shiver running down his spin. To his surprise Naruto found he had to stiff a cry of protest as Kuro broke his warm embrace and moved to the other side of the fire.</p><p>"We should eat now; this fire won't last long. The wood here is to damp to burn and it's not safe separate to look for drier wood." Naruto nodded, his mind still fogged by Kuro strangely warm body. Dinner was had in silence with Naruto still processing and Kuro plotting.</p><p>The wind began to pick up snuffing the life from the dwindling fire. Naruto shivered as the wind cut like knifes of ice through his light jacket. Kuro watched the boy shudder and a predatory smile stole across his handsome face.</p><p>"It's not good to be so cold. I remembered my bedding, perhaps we could share?" Kuro face and voice belied none of his motives; and Naruto fought unsuccessfully with the deep blush that tinted his checks at the thought of sharing the same blankets as Kuro. He was on the brink of denying the offer when the winds cold breath froze him to the bone; all he could bring himself to do was to nod mutely and shuffle over to where Kuro lay stretched beneath his blankets.</p><p>Even in the shelter of Kuro bedding Naruto was unable to get warm, and found himself, much to his chagrin, moving closer to Kuro radiant heat.</p><p>"Cold?" Kuro delightful voice asked.</p><p>"Aren't you? It's freezing!" Naruto cried and a blast of wind tore through the trees to prove his point. Kuro smirked revealing fanged white teeth to the now dark night. Careful he moved his warm body closer to his frozen companion.</p><p>"There are other ways to keep warm." His voice so low it could barely be heard above the howling wind; but the implication was not lost of the younger ninja practically curled in his arms. Naruto froze his mind whirling out of control as lewd images danced through his mind; and his tongue flickered out to dampen his dried lips.</p><p>"L-like what?" His voice shook as he tried to play innocent. Kuro's leer was masked by the night's dark veil, and he seemed to have abandoned words as his soft mouth covered Naruto's. The younger man froze but made no sign of disprovable as Kuro warm body moved to press the frozen Naruto to the ground. He broke his kiss and look down at the ninja straddled beneath him.</p><p>"Like this." Was as he said before he set his mouth to work, running his hot tongue down the Naruto's cold smooth cheek. One of his long hands traced the outline of Naruto's form through his bulky clothes and the other hand roughly pulled the zipper on the jacket down. Both hands worked together to shove the bothersome article free from the body.</p><p>At first Naruto was still, unsure of how to resound, but soon he found his own hands stripping the clothes off Kuro's burning body and pulling the older man down on top of him. Wither he was desperate for Kuro's warmth or for Kuro himself not even Naruto was sure, but soon twin cries could be heard echoing through the forest's silent corridors.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>AN: Why, you ask, is it cold in the middle of the fire country? Because Kyuubi and I found it convenient to our plots, so there! Hope you liked. I tried very hard to write a lemon, I really did, but I'm just not gutsy to write one so I apologize if I disappointed any of you. The next update will be up next week!

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer: Honestly I don't own Naruto, if you don't understand
that by know then I suggest seeing a doctor.</p><P>Warning:
This story is still Yaoi, yeah, again you all know this</p><P>I'm very warm, and I snuggle closer to the source of warmth only to
find a body in my bed, in shock I sit blot upright. My sudden
movement exposes my bare chest and that of the man sleeping next to
me to the still cool morning air. Wait the man sleeping next me?
Memories of the cold night before come crashing down on me like a
flash flood and they raise a warm blush in my checks. I allow myself
the guilty pleasure of glancing down at the man beside me. My eye
travel down his bare chest, following his every line till I reach the
edge of the blanket. My body trembles with desire to rip the blanket
from his body, but I managed to restrain myself. Then almost of its
own violation my hand moves to trace his beautiful pale jaw. Slowly
he opens those beautiful eyes. What do I do now?</p><P>The morning breeze
whispered over the bare chests of the two ninja curled beneath a
blanket high in a tree. A smile danced on Kuro's lips as he felt a
feather light touch brush his jaw, and leisurely he opened his dark
red eyes to meet a pair of bright blue ones.</p><P>"Good morning. How
are you feeling?" A deceptively shy smile crawled over Kuro's
face and Naruto scoffed.</p><P>"I'm tired and my
twig in my hair." He whined and a small yawn escaped his lips as he
flopped back down. The smile on Kuro's face widened, but he kept
his voice sympathetic.</p><P>"I'm sorry, I
sincerely hope you don't regret last night." Naruto glared up at
him.</p><P>"No I don't! I'm
just tired." He snapped peevishly and Kuro threw his head back and
laughed.</p><P>"Poor thing. Lucky I
have some of that wonderful energizing food your village provided us
with." Kuro's voice was filled with mirth and Naruto glared at
him. Again Kuro's charming laugh sounded and he moved to grab his
bag and pulled out something that looked less then eatable. Naruto
sniffed indignantly as he pulled on his clothes and grab the "food"
Kuro was offering him. As Naruto ate Kuro pulled on some clothing,
breakfast clasp between his teeth.</p><P>"There all better.
You'd be no fun if you were irritable." Kuro smirked over at his
prize as they finished eating.</p><P>"Come on lets find
some water I need to bathe." Naruto demanded.</p><P>"Yes you do, did you
know you have something on your stomach? Looks like dirt." Kuro
asked as he carefully rolled up the bedding. An odd look passed over
Naruto.</p><P>"Are you ok?"
Naruto blinked realizing the face he was making and shook his head as
if trying to rid himself of unwanted thoughts.</p><P>"Yeah, can you
hurry? I feel sticky." Naruto whined, his momentary moodiness
vanishing. Their small camp was easily cleaned up and soon the two
ninja were on their way. There was silence as they ran and Naruto
took the opportunity to think about the mark on his stomach that
should be as dark as new ink not so fade that it could be mistaken
for dirt.</p><P>The day seemed
determined to make up for the nights chill, and soon the forest was
filled with warm sunlight that dripped in like honey from the wide
green leaves. It wasn't long till the silent pair came to a shallow
river shaded by the trees. Quickly Naruto dropped his backpack and
shed his clothes trying to suppress the feeling of self-consciousness
that was creeping up the back of his neck in the form of a blush. It
didn't take long to strip of his clothes, though Naruto found
himself thinking that it was more enjoyable when Kuro did it for him.
The heat of the blush intensified with these thoughts and Naruto was
glad to sink into the cool river. He heard a soft splash as Kuro
slide out his clothes and into the river beside him.</p><P>Naruto
found that no matter how hard he tried he couldn't help looking at
Kuro. The dappled sunlight catching in the small droplets of water on
Kuro chest sparkled like diamonds. Carefully Kuro pulled the band
from his hair and stank below the surface. When his head broke free
of the water his long red hair was clinging to his face.</p><P>"Are
you just going to stare all day? I thought you wanted a bath."
Kuro's voice broke the spell that his body had wrapped Naruto in.
The blonde shook his head and turned away from the pretty redhead.
Kuro laughed and continued with his bath.</p><P>Later,
as the two of them lay drying in the warm sun, Kuro glanced at
Naruto.</p><P>"The
dirt on your stomach isn't gone; if you need help bathing you could
have asked me. I would have been glad to help." Kuro smirked down
at Naruto and Naruto made a face at him.</p><P>"It
isn't dirt, it's…um…" Naruto found that he could find
nothing to call the fading mark on his stomach. Kuro sighed and
placed a long figure on Naruto lips.</p><P>"Don't.
I know what it is." He said softly, Naruto gave him a sharp look.</p><P>"What
do you mean you know what it is?" Naruto questioned. Kuro shut his
eyes as if to hide them from the world.</p><P>"I
know because," He took a breath and opened one of his eyes to watch
Naruto, "because I was once bond by that seal." His demeanor had
changed. No longer was he bright and teasing, now he seemed like a
dog expecting to be beaten.</p><P>"You
were once… You're Kyuubi?!" Naruto cried springing to his feet.
Kuro flinched and nodded. Naruto feet gave way and he came crashing
towards the rock. Kuro strong arms caught him before he smacked the
hard surface.</p><P>"Don't
touch me!" Naruto snapped slapping at his hands. Kuro look
affronted but took his hands away from Naruto all the same. Kuro
opened his mouth to say something, but Naruto cut him off.</p><P>"I
don't want to hear what you have to say! You're a monster!
Because of you I was shunned my whole childhood! You tried to destroy
my village, you killed the 4th Hokage, and you orphaned so
many people, me included!" Kuro's eyes snapped open, he looked as
though he had been slapped, but he also looked angry.</p><P>"I'd
have left your village alone if they'd seen fit to leave me alone!"
He snapped, the dark red in his eyes growing more vibrant.</p><P>"What
did they do to you?!" Naruto cried returning Kuro's dark look.</p><P>"They had Madara
Uchiha kill my kit and my mate. My mate," Kuro made a dismissive
gesture with his hand, "A useless she-fox, but my kit… nothing
could replace him." Kuro face twisted with pain and he shut his
glowing eyes. For a moment silence hung in the. Kuro lifted his head
and met Naruto bright blue eyes with his fierce red ones.</p><P>"There are always
too sides to a story Naruto. No one if ever completely innocent."
Naruto was the first to break the stare, he let his eyes follow the
river till it bent into the thick trees.</p><P>"But all those
people… my parents… Iruka-sensei's parents…" Naruto voice
trailed off, he could bring himself to believe that the village had
brought the attack on themselves.</p><P>"Your father did
what he thought best. I don't blame him for what he did, even if I
do resent him a little; it's the Hokage place to defend his
village." Naruto blurred eyes focused sharply.</p><P>"What did you say?
My father was the forth Hokage?" Kuro raised a delicate eyebrow.</p><P>"I assumed that you
knew. Didn't they tell you?" Naruto made a face and shook his
head.</p><P>"As precious as my
village is to me they have an odd sense of what I need know and what
I may remain unsaid." Naruto pulled his legs up to his chest and
folded his arms over them.</p><P>"I, on the other
hand, would never keep anything from you." Kuro extended his hand
to Naruto and placed on his shoulder. Naruto glared at him.</p><P>"What does it matter
to you? I image that I'm just a plaything!" Naruto snapped
swatting at Kuro's pale hand.</p><P>"A play thing! If
you were a plaything I'd have been gone before you woke! Beside,"
Kuro smirked, "My 'playthings' rarely live to wake."</p><P>"That's
comforting." Naruto sneered.</p><P>"But you woke. You
are much more then a plaything to be cast aside when I tire of you."
Kuro hand traced the marks Naruto checks. "There was time when I
wished to be free of you, but now I find that that is the last thing
I want." Kuro voice was like silk, rapping Naruto in it soft
comfort. Carefully he pulled Naruto closer, but Naruto shrugged him
away again.</p><P>"I don't trust
you." Naruto said in a calm voice.</p><P>"But you can't
deny that you want to." Kuro voice was forceful now, but Naruto
pushed away again.</p><P>"Perhaps, but I need
time to think," Naruto stood his eyes distant; "I have a lot to
process." And then slowly, as if in a trance, Naruto walked away
from the sun warmed rock.</p><P>AN: Yeah update. My
computer's battery is dying as I type, and I can't plug it in

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>WARNING: I can finally
say that this chapter contains smut and yaoi!!! Happy!!! I feel I
must note that if the smut was not written by me but by Cassandra
Incognito so if you like the smut please show your appreciation by
going and reading some of her stories.</p><P>DISCLAIMER: I don't
own Naruto, I don't own Kyuubi, I don't own the smut for this
chapter, and I still don't own penguin.</p><P>NOTE OF THANKS: This
story was only made it here because of my beta kawaiicrimsonkitsune,

good stories. Also, because I can't thank her enough, Cassandra
Incognito wrote the smut for this chapter and I am in her debt, so go
and read her stories. Everyone loves reviews so leave these wonderful
people one or two!</p><P>------------</p><P>Trust. It's such a
simple word to describe something so complex. I want him to trust me!</p><P>Trust.
I can say the word, but I long to know the feeling, I want to have
the feeling returned. I know him so well, and yet he is as strange as
a word spoken in a foreign tongue. Am I such a familiar stranger to
him as well? If that is so then how can I expect him to trust
me? He asked to be left in peace, so he could think. For the time
being I will respect his wish, but I have spent too long in such
distant closeness that my restrain wouldn't last for long.</p><P>--------------------------</p><P>Calm water pooled by
the smoothed rocks to the side of the river. It lazily lapped at
Naruto's tan bare feet. His head was pillowed by a bed of soft
green grass and his eyes gazed unseeing up at the cottony clouds that
were strewn across the sky like the remnants of a child's art
project. The soft breeze ruffled his hair like a mother's caring
hands.</p><P>"Perhaps
Kuro, no, Kyuubi isn't as bad as I thought. I mean he did lie to me,
but at least he told me. He decided to be honest, and he has always
been there for me. He saved me more then once. Perhaps I should give
him another chance" The genin thought to himself.</p><P>Unbeknown
to the blond the same breeze that played so lovingly across his face
had blown his scent deep within the dark forest and had attracted
with its sweet breath a less benevolent occupant of the ancient
trees.</p><P>From
the shadow of the forest's edge something watched its distracted prey
and its eyes gleaming with reflected light. On velveteen paws it
crept towards the young man whose mind danced with a far away song.
The predators muscles rippled beneath its silky midnight coat, a soft
growl escaped its drawn lips. Even the low rumble failed to alert the
target of his impending doom.</p><P>Whether
by luck or simply because fate wasn't done with him yet, Naruto's
clear blue eyes snapped into focus. His trained senses alerted him to
the presence of his ill intended guest. His body tensed and he sprang
to his feet in preparation to fight. His response came too late. The
deadly visitor lunged towards the terrified nin.</p><P>The
blond cried out as the razor-like claws tore across his stomach in a
swipe that would have gutted him if he hadn't jumped back. His hand
instinctively moved to press his bleeding wound, but despite the
pressure his blood slipped through his figures adding a pale red
stain to the gentle river.</p><P>Kuro
who sat on a sun bathed rock not far down stream watched in
<BR>fascination the playful swirls of red that mingled and
danced with the water. But fascination turned to horror as the
uniquely metallic scent of blood rose from the<BR>water. Kuro's
dark eyes grew wide. His stomach curled in a giant knot as a growl
emanated deep within his throat. He knew this scent, and it belonged
to a certain blond shinobi that he cherished above all others, his
Naruto.</p><P>Kuro's
form flickered upstream, his passing all but untraceable. Not far
beyond the bend in the river he found the source of the rivers red
vein. Hands pressed over his stomach, with a freely bleeding wound on
his arm, Naruto knelt in the shallows on the far side of the river.
It was then that Kuro saw the attacker.</p><P>The
giant feline crouched with predatory grace on the bank of the river.
His orb-like eyes held the whimpering Naruto captive and a hungry
snarl tore from the huge cat's mouth. Kuro felt rage consume his
entire being. The wounded blond belonged to him and him alone. His
shape rippled becoming more fox-like and less human.</p><P>As
he lunged only traces of the man called Kuro remained. It was Kyuubi
that knocked the panther to the ground. It was Kyuubi whose claws
were stained the deepest of reds as he ripped out the throat of the
great beast beneath him spilling the ruby red blood onto the emerald
grass, the very life force draining from his foe. But it was Kuro
turned and walked across the river towards his injured mate.</p><P>The
blond looked up, his face pale with blood lose, and fainted. Kuro
dove forward catching Naruto in his already blood soaked arms. Gently
the man laid him on the grass beside the river. The younger ninja's
breathing was shallow and caught with each painful breathe inhaled.</p><P>Carefully
Kuro placed his hands over the blond's lithe form, an eerie green
glow flickering over his fingers. His body remained perfectly still
as his graceful hands danced up and down Naruto's injured form.
Slowly the ninja's flesh began to knit back together, leaving only
the lightest pink lines where once life threatening gashes had once
lain. The blonds' breathing became rhythmic and deep as he slipped
into a light slumber. Kuro smiled and laid down beside Naruto,
wrapping him in his arms heedless of the blood that caked both his
own form and that of the softly whimpering figure of the blond he
held.</p><P>As
Naruto slipped back into consciousness the first thing he noticed was
that the deep wounds that had caused him to black out were mended and
the next was the savory smell of cooking meat that hung in the air.
He sat up and looked around to discover a warm fire with a black pot
neatly suspended over it. Apparently Kuro had managed to find some
dry firewood. Across the serene river knelt Kuro, knife in hand,
scraping at something. Naruto shuddered as he remembered the demon
that had burst from the seemly harmless husk that was Kuro's body.
As if called by Naruto's thoughts the man across the way lifted his
eyes to meet his small lovers.</p><P>"You're
awake, good. The food is almost ready." Kuro stated. Naruto nodded
and suppressed a shudder as he again remember how Kuro had become
Kyuubi, but this time the memory caused Naruto to feel something
unexpected. It caused him to feel safe. He watched silently as
his protector walked across the river, careful not to let his feet
dip below the surface, and moved to stir the contents of the pot.</p><P>"What is it?" Naruto questioned, strolling over to observe the
stewing pot.</p><P>"Panther." Kuro stated a grin playing across his lips. Naruto
look aghast and Kuro raised a delicate eyebrow at him.</p><P>"Wouldn't you rather eat mission food?" The blond asked,
warily observing the bubbling mixture in the pot.</p><P>The
wrinkling of Kuro's nose said quite plainly what he thought of the
idea. Remembering the tasteless so-called food that Konoha provide
for the mission, Naruto found he had to agree. Still Naruto had
to hold back a slight chuckle observing the amusing expression Kuro
had on his face. With a sigh the blond sat down.</p><P>'<I>Perhaps eating what would have been my killer isn't so bad.
In fact I believe it holds a bit of poetic justice.'</I> The blond
thought to himself as he cautiously dipped his spoon into the stew.
Letting out a surprised squeal and moan Naruto licked his lips. The
warm soup was surprisingly good, true it was no ramen, but it was
certainly better then that nutrient packed stuff that both he and
Kuro had stashed in their packs.</p><P>A
quick glance around the camp sight revealed that Kuro had moved both
sets of packs upstream, but the fact that only the cooking gear was
unpacked suggested that Kuro didn't intended to stay the night
here.</p><P>"We're
moving?" The younger-nin asked in-between spoonfuls. Kuro nodded
and gestured to the thing he'd been working on that still lay
across the river.</p><P>"The
smell of food will bring more predators, we will move so that we
don't<BR>become the prey again." Even as he said we Naruto
knew that Kuro wasn't talking about himself. The redhead had been
anything but the prey in the earlier encounter.</p><P>"What
were you working on?" The blond asked gesturing across the river.</p><P>"I
was preparing the skin to be sent to a tanner's to be finished and
turned into a throw or a rug. Or perhaps a fur lined cloak. Whatever
you prefer." Kuro shrugged as if it made little difference to him.</p><P>"I
prefer that it is left here to rot." Naruto said indignantly.</p><P>"If
that is what you wish, but it would be a waste. The panther had a
lovely coat." Kuro shrugged and Naruto glared at the offending fur
as if it had personally affronted him. Despite his previous complaint
Naruto made no comment when, after dinner had been cleared, Kuro
carefully folded the skin and took it with them. The pair made their
way silently down the river past the rock that they had laid on till
they came to clearing, not unlike the one they had just left. As
night fell it promised to be bitterly cold again despite the warmth
of the day.</p><P>As
Kuro laid out the one set of blankets Naruto decided that the wind
was even colder down by the water.</p><P>"Do
we have enough wood for a fire?" The blond asked shivering as the
cold began to seep beneath his clothes.</p><P>"And
draw more animals? I don't fancy finding out how big moths grow in
this forest." Kuro said, his voice serious, as he didn't even
take the effort to look up. The image of giant bloodthirsty moths
brought Naruto to Kuro's side.</p><P>"But
I'm cold!" The blond whined as he pressed against the man's
warmth. His innocent blue eyes giving a pleading stare at Kuro.</p><P>"You
don't need a fire to keep warm Naruto. I thought you would have
learned that little fact by now." The fox said with a grin. -
- - - - - WARNING!!! BEGINNING OF YAOI HOT SMUTTINESS!!!!- - - - -</p><P>The
blond let out a small "epp" of surprise as he felt a hand shift
behind his back and pull him closer into the intoxicating warmth of
the invigorating redhead.</p><P>"Or
do I need to teach you again?" A large blush stained the cheeks of
the shivering genin.</p><P>"I've
learned that! Kyu, but I wouldn't't mind a little reminder."
Naruto admitted, hiding his face into the crook of the Kuro's body.</p><P>"Kyu?"</p><P>"Yeah.
I figured I should call you by your actual name now. Since well…
you know, since I found out." A large smile spread across the
redhead's cheeks.</p><P>"So
you're ok with me being the demon that inhabited your body since
you were born?"</p><P>"No!
Not yet. But I'm learning. You have yet to lie to me Kyu, and
you've saved me numerous times, and I'm beginning to see the
reasoning behind your attack on the village. I forgive you, but I
don't trust you." Naruto said making eye contact with the man he
once considered to be a monster, a beast.</p><P>A
thoughtful look crossed the redhead's face. He gave a slight smile,
moving down to capture the pink lips of the blond he had come to
adore.</p><P>"That's
enough, for now." He whispered breathy, pressing his firm lips
against the soft plump ones before him.</p><P>Naruto
cautiously returned the man's affections, moving nervously against
the man holding him. His hands, grasping the material of his shirt as
he let out a high-pitched squeal. A wandering hand had moved down to
caress his bottom, pinching one of the taunt cheeks, causing the
blond to squeak in protest. Jumping at his chance the redhead thrust
his tongue forward, capturing the genin's with ease.</p><P>The
blond moaned into the kiss, inciting a low growl from the throat of
the older man. Kuro explored the mouth of the mewling nin, caressing
the soft organ with his own hot appendage. The older nin slowly
allowed his hand to drift up the back of the shuddering teen.
Cautiously he lifted the young mans shirt and raised it over his
lithe arms, meeting no resistance.</p><P>Breaking
from the kiss Kyuubi looked up to greet the most beautiful cerulean
eyes he had ever had the privilege to gaze upon. The blond's lids
were half open, dark eyelashes fluttered gracefully as he met the
lust filled gaze of his Naruto.</p><P>"Na-ru-to-kun,"
Kyuubi drawled out, the words dripping from his lips.</p><P>"Y-yes,
Kyu?" Naruto all but whimpered.</p><P>"You
said you wanted a little reminder right?" Kyuubi smirked; as his
hand drifted down to caress the slowly forming buldge in the orange
pants the blond had adorning his hot little body.</p><P>Naruto
slowly thought back to the first night he had spent with the man he
called Kuro in the forest. - - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P>"<I>Cold?"
Kuro asked, a slight smirk playing on his lips. </I></p><P>"<I>Aren't
you? It's freezing!" Naruto cried and a blast of wind tore
through the trees to prove his point. Kuro allowed his grin to widen,
revealing fanged white teeth to the now dark night. In a single fluid
movement he shifted his body closer to his frozen companion. </I></p><P>"<I>There
are other ways to keep warm." His voice so low it could barely be
heard above the howling wind. The implication however, was not
lost to the younger ninja, who was practically curled in his
arms. Naruto froze, his mind whirling out of control as lewd images
danced through it. His pink tongue flickered out to dampen his dry
lips, causing Kuro to think of other lovely things that tongue could
be doing, but more of that later, he had to let the little blond come
to him willingly first. </I></p><P>"<I>L-like
what?" Naruto's voice shook as he tried to play innocent. </I></p><P><I>Kuro's
leer was masked by the night's dark veil and he seemed to have
abandoned words as his soft mouth covered Naruto's. The younger man
froze but made no sign of disprovle as Kuro's warm body moved to
press the frozen nin to the ground. He broke his kiss and look down
at the ninja straddling his waist. </I></p><P>"<I>Like
this." A soft mouth went to work, as a hot tongue descended down
Naruto's cold smooth cheek. One of his long hands traced the
outline of the blond's's form through his bulky clothes, while his
other hand roughly pulled the zipper on the jacket down. Both hands
worked together to shove the bothersome article free from the body. </I></p><P><I>At
first Naruto was still, unsure of how to respond, but soon he found
his own hands stripping the clothes off the redhead's burning body
and pulling the older man down on top of him. He was whimpering
desperately for Kuro's warmth or for Kuro himself, Naruto wasn't
even sure at the moment what he wanted. All he knew was that he
couldn't get enough of the intoxicating heat curling around his
frame. </I></p><P><I>The
red head lowered his hands from tweaking the pink nipples on his
<BR>delicious blond's chest down to knead the taunt cheeks of
Naruto's ass. Earning him a delightful mewl in response. His
devilish tongue snaked forward to taste the soft skin at the junction
of the neck of his tempting blond pet. Creating a slick trail from
collarbone to jaw, descending down to capture a pink bud. Naruto
thrust his hips upward, causing wonderful friction between
himself and the man above him. </I></p><P><I>Both
let out a gasp as Naruto continued to roll his hips. Tears of passion
as lust sprung from the blond's deep blue eyes as he felt a delicious
heat uncoiling in his stomach. He felt the pressure on his body
dissipate as the older nin shifted his body off the panting blond. </I></p><P>"<I>Kuro?"
He asked, completely dazed and confused. </I></p><P>"<I>Shh,
I'm going to warm you up quite nicely." The man said, placing a
finger to the plump lips of his new pet. </I></p><P><I>Unzipping
the blonds' pants, he lowered them off of the tan hips in
front of him. Tugging the boxers to the ground he grabbed Naruto's
erect member, dipping his thumb into the slit of the tip. Naruto
managed a groan in acknowledgment, as his hands lowered to work on
the man before him. Slipping his fingers into the fold of the pants,
slowly tugging the offending material down to the man's knees. He
let his hand slip into the older mans pants, hesitantly grabbing hold
of the member. Naruto began to caress the sides, allowing his thumb
to press forward and massage the slit of the opening, just like the
redhead had done for him. He began moving his fingers back and forth
to pump the member. Kuro let out an appreciative moan, and began to
pump the blond teen faster in thanks. </I></p><P><I>The
two continued their ministrations as Naruto felt himself reaching a
<BR>precipice. He wasn't sure what this feeling he was
experiencing was. He had never felt this way before, and not even
when he had explored his own body did he ever have a feeling quite
this intense. </I></p><P>"<I>Kuro!
I'm going to-" the words in his mouth were stopped by a swipe of
a hungry tongue against his lips. Opening his mouth he allowed the
tongue to continue its exploration. Naruto was so incredibly close,
just a little more. </I></p><P><I>The
blond screamed calling out into the night, as Kuro followed him into
completion. The echoes of their moans drifting off into the night. </I></p><P><I>Later
Naruto curled into the warm arms surrounding his body, hearing a
husky whisper of 'are you warm now?' and a hot breath on his ear
as he drifted off into a comfortable sleep. </I><BR>- - - - - -
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p><P>A
blush flushed across Naruto's cheeks as he remembered the hot
night, and the safety of the arms around him. A brush of a hand
across his crotch sent a moan out of his thoroughly molested lips.</p><P>"Ah!
Yes! Kyu." The blond said, his body shuddering with want.</p><P>"How
about I teach you a little something new then, my pet?" Moving to
unzip the young mans pants; he pushed the material past tan thighs,
kissing the skin revealed. Whimpering with lust the genin shook with
pleasure. Tugging the last of the material covering the teen's
body, Kyuubi's head descended to lap at his prize.</p><P>Naruto
let out a squeal of surprise, which melded with a low moan, finally
dissolving into whimpers, as he felt the most intense increase in
pressure and a coiling of heat spread through his belly, uncurling
slowing, and sending wave after wave of pleasure coursing through his
body. The teen knew he was coming close.</p><P>"Kyu!"
Naruto yelled as he came into the red head's mouth. The fox raised
his head, licking his lips.</p><P>"You
taste delicious pet." He said with a smirk. Naruto felt a
light blush flutter across his cheeks. He looked absolutely
molestable, with his lips rouged from the gentle bites Kyuubi had
left, his eye's half lidded with ecstasy, and a light pink shade
tinting his cheeks.</p><P>Leaning
forward, Kyu whispered into the blond's ear.</p><P>"Your
turn, chibi."</p><P>Turning
a shade usually reserved for cooked lobsters Naruto slowly nodded,
his hands fumbling to remove the demon's pants. Stopping the
bumbling hands, Kyuubi removed his pants himself, pushing the
offending material off of his body. Gently he cupped the blond's
chin in his hands, his mouth molding into the soft ones before
him. Naruto pulled away slightly, before lowering his head to reach
about waist level. Looking up with bright cerulean eyes, he
cautiously licked the tip of the throbbing appendage. Causing a low
growl to emanate from Kuro's mouth, as he closed his eyes briefly.</p><P>"Dammit
brat. Continue before I make you, and… Oh Kami!" Kuro
exclaimed. Looking down he saw the most delightful sight. In between
his legs a tuft of blond hair emerged, slowly bobbing up and down
hesitantly. A light grip on the teen's hair proved to egg him on,
as he continued his ministrations.</p><P>"Naruto,
look at me." Kuro demanded in a soft voice.</p><P>The
teen raised his eyes to make contact with the man in front of him,
still licking and bobbing his head.</p><P>'<I>Gods,
I'm not going to last very long with that hot little mouth on me.'</I>
Kyuubi tensed before releasing a steady stream into the awaiting
mouth on him. A small excess dripped out of the corner of the blonds'
mouth, causing the man to shudder in delight. Reaching down he delved
into the genin's mouth, enjoying his taste mixed in with the
tantalizing mixture that made up Naruto.</p><P>The
blond sighed into the kiss, finding himself safe and complete in the
arms of his once inhabitant, now lover. Cuddling closer to the warmth
the man provided Naruto shifted his head under the chin of the man
and began to slowly drift off into sleep, not even waking when he was
shifted up in a tree, and lowered into a sleeping bag, with a hot
body following. He barely even stirred as a pale arm snaked around
his waist to pull him closer.</p><P>Smiling
at the serene blond, Kuro tucked a stray blond hair out of the teens
face, and lightly placed a kiss on his forehead, before he pulled the
blond closer and he himself drifted off into sleep.</p><P>AN: More thanks to my

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>DISCLAIMER: Nope I
still don't own Naruto</p><P><I>A pained yipping
fills my ears and brings me racing towards my den. The cries that had
been growing steadily louder abruptly cut off. My mind whirls, the
silence is even more horrifying then pleas for help had been. As I
draw near my den there is an overwhelming sense of malice that gives
even me a pause. I feel a snarl growing deep within my chest, the
only presence in my den is the menacing one. </I></p><P><I>"Ken'ichi!" I
call worry fills my voice. There is no answer save for the sound of
soft laugher. I enter my den and a man turns around. His eyes are as
red as the blood that coats his pale hands.</I></p><P><I>"Aw Kyuubi Danzo said you'd come." </I></p><P>Kuro woke with a howl
of rage on his lips. Naruto made a disgruntled sound and sat up.</p><P>"Kyu?" He yawned,
his eyes still foggy with sleep. Kuro rounded on Naruto lips pulled
back in an angry snarl. Naruto eyes grew wide and he could see the
animal raging just below the surface in Kuro.</p><P>"Kyu what's
wrong?" Naruto voice was uncertain and Kuro face twisted as he
fought with his rational side. He fell to his kneel pressing his head
between his hands. Naruto looked worried and came to crouch down by
the redhead; he placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><P>"Tell me what's
wrong." He implored. Genuine concern for both Kuro and what would
happen to him if the demon lost it moved Naruto to comfort the man. 
Kuro swallowed and moved his hands to cradle his face.</p><P>"Ken'ichi."
Kuro's voice was soft and almost lost beneath the sounds of the
forest. Confused Naruto cocked his head.</p><P>"What?" Naruto's
hand began to form small circles on Kuro's back.</p><P>"Yes, what! What
could they possibly have wanted to kill him for? He was just a kit."
Kuro voice was angry and his charka was flaring. Naruto tensed, the
conversation was going wrong.</p><P>"Was Ken'ichi your
kit?" Naruto asked trying to piece Kuro's rambling together. Kuro
whined and nodded.</p><P>"Kyu look at me."
Naruto pulled the pale hands away and force Kuro's pretty face to
look up at his, "Ken'ichi died fifteen years ago, being angry now
isn't going to bring him back." Kuro broke free of Naruto's
hands and looked down.</p><P>"I said look at me
Kyu! Tell me what happened." Naruto commanded it was disquieting to
see Kuro like this; he was a powerful demon and always very much in
control. The man kneeling on the ground licked his lips and started.</p><P>"Fifteen years ago I
had a mate and kit. My mate was simply convenient to have around, but
really she was nothing more then a large fox; much like your large
summoning toads. But my kit, Ken'ichi, was very… very dear to me.
One night I heard Ken'ichi starte cry, it was his danger cry."
Kuro looked upset but continued, "I ran back to my den, but when I
got there both my mate and my little kit lay dead. The only living
thing left in the den was their murder, Madara
Uchiha. I was free of a human continer then and not easliy
surpressed, I kill Madara but not before learning who he was working
for. He said that Danzo of Konoha had sent him. So I attacked Konoha
and your story begins." Kuro voice had become detacted durning his
story.</p><P>"Why
would someone from Konoha want to kill you kit?" Naruto asked too
confused to remember that he was supposed to be calmly Kuro down.</p><P>"How
should I know!" Kuro snapped and Naruto flinched, but instead of
losing it Kuro leened back on his heels. With
the dream fading the sharp pain of his only son's death faded to
back the sad memory it had been. He looked at the worry that was so
plain on Naruto's face and let out a bitter laugh. Naruto gave him
a sharp look a raised an eyebrow.</p><P>"I
should be grateful I suppose. Everything has a blance if I hadn't
lost Ken'ichi I'd never have found you." This gentlier side of
Kuro shocked Naruto and he let himself be pulled into a soft hug.</p><P>"Just
two more nights here, let try not to nearly
die again today." Kuro teased Naruto shoving his memories deeper.
But Naruto knew they were there, laying like timebombs till something
as simple as a dream set them off again.</p><P>AN: I really hate this
chapter; it is the result of writer's block, two new college
classes on top all nine of my high school classes, being ground,
another broke power cord, and making lame excuses. So if this chapter
just feels… wrong to you, don't worry it feels off to me as well.
I should have the chapter up by next weekend, even if I have to beat
those plot bunnies with a whip!</p><P>POLL RESULTS: If you
don't want to know the tone that I'm going to end my story stop
reading HERE.</p><P>First, I want to thank
all of you who voted. If you voted and your ending didn't win, I'm
sorry. If you didn't vote and your ending didn't win, I don't
care. So the Happy Ending won by a long shot and so the story will
ending happy, but that doesn't mean there not going to be any
issues with their relationship.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><p>Disclaimer: I don't own anything, but I really, really want a Mustang.</p><p>Warning: spandex!!!!</p><p>Note of Thanks: Please thank my wonderful beta, kawaiicrimsonkitsune; she makes it possible for me to get this up at all.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade><i>The afternoon sun is warm on my back as I sit on a flat rock. Kuro is standing stripped down in the waste deep water. Modesty is a foreign word to him, not that I mind watching his wet skin shine in the slanting sunlight. I shake my head to clear such thoughts. I am too busy with worrying to spend time considering how appealing Kuro manages to make fishing. The first those worries in my village. My relationship with Kuro is hardly traditional. I snort, my "relationship" is another thought spinning around in my head. What I am to Kuro? What is he to me?</i></p><p><i>My thoughts shy away from those questions and run head long into Kakashi, Tsunade, and Sakura. Did they know what Kuro really was? It made no sense for them not to. They were frustrating people even when I didn't suspect them of keeping information about a deadly demon I would be spending the week with from me. </i></p><p><i>I sigh and rub my eyes. Kuro's alluring body catches my attention again and I quickly decide that watching him fish is much more enjoyable then my current trains of thought.</i></p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Out of the corner of his eye Kuro watched Naruto. The young ninja's forehead was wrinkled with concern. Kuro shook his head and lunged at a fish, Naruto had been doing this all day. Surfacing, fish in hand, Kuro heard Naruto sigh again and promptly through the fish at his head.</p><p>"Stop that!" He snapped and Naruto gave him a puzzled look and snatched the fish before it escaped back into the river.</p><p>"Stop what?" The fish was slippery and a bit of thrashing managed to earn it temporary freedom that ended back in Kuro's hands.</p><p>"The sighing and forehead wrinkling! What's wrong?" In response Naruto sighed and wrinkled his forehead, Kuro grip tightened on the poor fish in frustration.</p><p>"Nothing's…" Naruto began but changed his mind when he saw Kuro's face, "Lot's of things."</p><p>"Like what?" Kuro climb up on the rock next to Naruto.</p><p>"Like you, me, us. It's very confusing!" Naruto said throwing his hands in the air and Kuro gave him an odd look.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Kuro managed to look adorably confused.</p><p>"What do you mean, what do I mean? What am I to you Kyu?!" Naruto snapped, but the moment the words left his mouth Naruto wanted them back.</p><p>"To me… I-I don't know. I-I think I love you." Naruto blinked and the redhead in front of him. The man was stuttering worse then Hinata, but the message had been clear.</p><p>"Come again? I'm not sure I heard you right." Disbelief was sweeping into Naruto jumbled mind. He firmly told himself not to get excited, that this was probably just a dream; a wonderful, beautiful dream.</p><p>"I think I've decided that I think that I'm in love with you, maybe." For the first time in his life Naruto was at a loss for words. Nobody had even told him that they loved him, and he a sort of been expecting the words to come from a human, a female human. He was very glad that he was already sitting.</p><p>"Love me?" The words felt odd on his lips and Naruto was unsure as to how to respond to them. He rubbed his eyes; this week was anything but good for his mental health. Kuro sat stone still his senses trained on Naruto.</p><p>"Yes, I think. I've never been in love before, but I'd imagine this is how it would feel." Naruto study the man in front of him. For such a little word love could mean so many things.</p><p>"Love is it? Are you sure it's not lust?" Naruto refused to believe that the demon Kyuubi had fallen in love with a mortal, but lust most certainly didn't seem beyond him.</p><p>"Lust I've felt before. In fact I'm very familiar with it and I don't deny that it is very prevalent in my feelings for you. But there is something more, a worry that something will happen to you, a fear that I'll hurt you. It's odd, and I think that's what it means to love, to care about what happens to a person." Naruto continued to stare at the redhead in front of him.</p><p>"I don't know if I love you, but I wouldn't want to live without you. You've been here my whole life and I think I can't imagine life without you. That horrid emptiness that you keep at bay would consume me." Naruto shuddered.</p><p>"You'll never have to worry about that emptiness Naruto, because I won't leave you." Kuro pulled Naruto against his still damp chest, but the moment was ruined by the fish's last desperate bolt for freedom.</p><p>Kuro leaned against a tree with Naruto enfolded in his arms. Dusk was failing and the dying embers were glowing in the fading light.</p><p>"We should move soon." Kuro stated, and Naruto murmured something in response. Kuro smiled down at his little blond and gently pressed his lips against Naruto's hair. A sudden pop caused Kuro's hold on Naruto to tighten. The pop had been accompanied by a poof of smoke that quickly faded to reveal two men in bright green spandex.</p><p>"Such youthful passion!" The older of the two men cried.</p><p>"I agree Gai-sensei!" The younger shouted in response. Naruto, had been dozing off, sat up and blinked.</p><p>"Lee? Gai? What are you doing here?" Naruto was still hoping this was a bad dream and he would wake up at any minute.</p><p>"Maybe it's part of the test." Kuro suggested staring in horror at the two men in front of them.</p><p>"That would be just like the old hag. Maybe if we hold very still they'll forget we're here." Naruto muttered before snuggling back into Kuro.</p><p>"Naruto, Kuro, the Hokage sent us to tell you to return to Konoha, she also said that this letter would explain." Gai said handing Kuro an envelope with the Hokage's seal on it. Kuro eyed Gai before ripping the envelope and reading the letter; his eyes grew wide and flickered down to Naruto.</p><p>"Akatsuki." He breathed.</p><p>"What?" Naruto sat bolt upright and grabbed the letter from Kuro. His eyes flew down the page, "Bastards!" He snapped leaping up, grabbing his bag, and dashing off into the forest. "Hurry!"</p><p>Kuro sighed, collected his bag and followed after Naruto. Gai stood watching after them with tears in his eyes.</p><p>"They are so youthful!"</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>AN: There it is. I'm so sorry about it being late, I got sick and I had all my final stuff due for school. But I really should be able to be better about timing now that its summer semester and I'll only have three classes. I hope you liked it! The next chapter should be up next weekend.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer: I own
nothing and I'm too sleepily to figure out a fancy way of saying
it.</p><P>NOTE OF THANKS: My
beta, kawaiicrimsonkitsune, is wonderful and deserves much thanks. So
if you are happy that I got this up on time-ish (for once) thank her
by reading some of her stories!</p><P>-- -- --</p><P><I>Akatsuki.
The word is like a vile poison, but the loathing I feel for them is
but a shadow of his. Even from here, three branches behind, I can
feel the passion of his hate dripping from every inch of his being.
The intensity makes me shiver; too think my blond angel could hate
anything so entirely horrifies me. </I></p><P><I>Akatsuki.
I despise them and I will never let them have my Naruto.</I></p><P>-- -- --</p><P>The
tree flashed by in a green blur and the four men tore through the
trees.</p><P>"Slow
down Naruto, the Akatsuki are just moving; they aren't attacking
Konoha!" Kuro called out. Naruto sighed and slowed to run next
to Kuro.</p><P>"Such
youthfulness should not be restrained!" Gai called from the
branch behind and Kuro growled.</p><P>"You're
the one that decided to listen to them." Naruto muttered and
Kuro glared at him.</p><P>"And
ignoring them would have accomplished so much more." Their
conversation was interrupted as they came to towering chain link
fence.</p><P>"Lee
and I are going to go train!" Gai informed them as they landed
on the ground.</p><P>"Maybe
we can train later Naruto; I have wanted a chance to see how much
your skills have improved." Lee called as he and Gai turned and
left in the other direction. Naruto waved and turned to find Kuro
giving the departing ninja a befuddled look.</p><P>"They
confuse me, why are they going to train at dusk?" Kuro asked.</p><P>"I
don't know, life is a whole lot easier if you don't try to
understand them." With that Naruto turned towards Konoha and
Kuro fallowed after staring after Gai and Lee for a few more moments.</p><P>Neither Naruto nor Kuro
noticed the two people hidden in the shadows of the trees.</p><P>"Now?"
One of them asked anticipation lining his voice.</p><P>"You
really are stupid. You want to attack him now with Konoha just a
short run away and a ninja that can fight Kisame twice and live just
shouting distance away? No thanks I kind of enjoy living." The
other snapped.</p><P>"You're
no fun." The first whined.</p><P>"Go
ahead get yourself killed, I'll watch." The second snapped
before fading back into the trees, the other glared at the target
before following his companion.</p><P>--- --- ---</p><P>"You
better not fail us Granny, it was your idea to call us out the
forest!" Naruto snapped glaring at Tsunade who sat behind her
desk glaring at the blond.</p><P>"Naruto,
its general not good practice to anger people in power." Kuro
said placing a restraining hand of Naruto's shoulder. Naruto
scoffed but remained quite.</p><P>"As
I was saying you two didn't complete the test, but the elders agree
that it was too risky to leave you in the forest so you both passed.
However…"</p><P>"I'm
a chunnin!" Naruto cried pumping the air.</p><P>"Yes,
now shut up! We have a problem of were Kuro is going live to
deal with. There are no open apartments, so we need to find someone
willing to share one with him." Naruto looked bored.</p><P>"Kyu
can share an apartment with me." Tsunade and Shizune exchanged a
look.</p><P>"That
would be fine. Do have somewhere for him to sleep?" Tsunade
asked giving Naruto a spectacle look. Naruto just smiled in response.</p><P>"I'm
sure we can find a place."</p><P>--- --- --- ---</p><P>The
night was dark, but the street was lit with the warm glow of shops
and three girls sat looking bored. Finally a forth joined them and
they started down the street.</p><P>"What
took you so long TenTen?" Ino asked, obviously annoyed, but the
girl ignored her question and turned to Sakura.</p><P>"Who
is the guy that your team brought in?" She asked and Sakura
looked shocked.</p><P>"He
said his name was Kuro. Why?" Sakura hoped that she didn't
sound as unnerved as she felt.</p><P>"You'll
never believe what I heard!" TenTen said motioning for the
others to move closer.</p><P>"Lee
said that when he and Gai-sensei went to get them in the forest they
were cuddling." She said in a conspiratorial whisper.</p><P>"Naruto
cuddles?" Ino asked wrinkling her nose and Hinata looked very
upset.</p><P>"Shizune
said that Naruto called him 'Kyu' and that they are going to be
sharing Naruto's apartment." Sakura mussed out loud, "But
I'm sure that just because all there is no open apartments, besides
I bet Lee's just lying to get TenTen's attention." She quickly
added when she saw Hinata's face.</p><P>"I
was pretty surprised; I always thought that Naruto had a thing for
Sasuke." TenTen said before braking out in giggles. The
others gave her a weird look and waited for her to catch her breath.
"You guys should have seen Neji's face, it was priceless.
Apparently he's a homophobic, he and Lee got into the big fight
over it." She managed between giggles.</p><P>"Neji
is a homophobic? I thought he was gay." Ino said.</p><P>"Don't
tell him that." TenTen glanced over at Hinata who was being
quieter then normal. She noticed how upset she was and exchanged a
look with Sakura and understanding flashed across her face. "Hey
Hinata I'm sure what Sakura said before is true. You know how Lee
is, always exaggerating everything, they were probably just sitting
near the each other." Hinata nodded, but still looked upset.</p><P>"Naruto
isn't worth the trouble anyway," Ino said firmly, "Oh
look lets eat there." The four of them walked towards the store
Ino had pointed too. Naruto quickly fell from the conversation, but
as she was going into the shop Hinata thought she saw Naruto
walk past with a beautiful, male, companion.</p><P>--- --- ---</p><P>AN: yay it's on
time-ish, like I said before this is thanks to my beta! This next
chapter should be one time to as I have already started it! I hope
you liked it!</p>

THANKS: As it says in the warning that you probably didn't read
this chapter is lemon. I didn't write it however, </U><U>Cassandra
Incognito did. So you liked it run along and read her stories as
well, they won't disappoint. I'll include the link to her profile
at the end of this chapter.</U></p><P>-----</p><P><I>The warm light from
the shops emanating in the street gives enough light to see clearly
through the dark night. The hot press of bodies warms the air around
me. </I></p><P><I>'It feels so good
to be back' I think as I weaved my way through the street. Glancing
to the side I think I catch a glimmer of Hinata's face, she looked
upset. I shrug and turn to grab Kuro's wrist, he is endanger of
getting lost going as slow as he is. I feel a shiver run up my spine
as I my fingers grasp the warm flesh of his wrist. He raises a
delicate eyebrow, but says nothing. </I></p><P><I>Much to my surprise
he allows himself to be pulled down the street. I picked up my pace
as the ramen shop comes into view, but a sudden thought gives me a
mental pause. Does Kuro or ramen taste better?</I></p><P>- - - - - - - - - - -</p><P>The ramen was hot and
wonderful, or at least it was in Naruto's opinion. In Kuro's
opinion it smelled funny, only Naruto's obvious love for the food
before him could force the demon to put in his mouth. Much to his
surprise it wasn't as horrid as he thought it would be, once you
got over the fact that it had a similar texture to worms it wasn't
half bad.</p><P>The redhead sat
marveling at how much of the worm-like noodles Naruto could shove
into his mouth at such a high velocity. His concentration was broken
when a young man with a long scar on his nose sat down on blonde's
other side.</p><P>"I'd heard that
you were back Naruto." The man said after ordering a bowl of ramen
for himself.</p><P>"Iruka-sensei!"
Naruto cried, demonstrating an amazing ability to speak with his
mouth complete full. The man laughed and gestured to Kuro.</p><P>"Who's your
friend?" The innocent question brought a deep blush to Naruto's
tan cheeks and Kuro laughed softly. Iruka gave the pair an odd look.
It soon became apparent that Naruto was to busy blushing to answer.</p><P>"I'm his…"
Kuro cast around for the right word, and then with an evil smirk
concluded, "His boyfriend, Kuro." The answers caused the blond to
choke and smack him upside the head.</p><P>"What was that for?"
Kuro asked, pretending to be offended.</p><P>"I can answer a
question Kyu!" Naruto snapped as Kuro made a defensive gesture.</p><P>"I hadn't
noticed." He said smiling. Naruto made a face and turned back to
Iruka who had been watching with curiosity.</p><P>"How have you been
Iruka-sensei?" He asked pointedly ignoring Kuro.</p><P>"I'm fine, but I
get the feeling I'm missing something." Iruka said. Naruto glared
at Kuro who shrugged.</p><P>"They'd have found
out sooner or later, it's much better if you tell them." Naruto
continued to glare at him.</p><P>"Still you could
have been a less abrupt." Again he turned away from Kuro and back
to Iruka.</p><P>"I'm really sorry
to not stay and talk Iruka-sensei, but I'm tired. I'll see you
around." Naruto said ending the conversion. He turned to pay and
Iruka moved to stand beside Kuro. Kuro tensed as he felt a hard edge
of knife press into his side.</p><P>"I don't know who
you are or where you came from, but if you even think of hurt that
boy you'll regret it." Iruka threatened never losing his smile.
Kuro flashed his set of pearly whites at him.</p><P>"You have no need to
worry." Iruka smiled wider and nodded before returning to his seat.
Kuro rubbed his side and followed Naruto, who had finished paying,
out of the stand.</p><P>"You have very
protective friends." He stated simply turning to walk off. Naruto
gave him an odd look when the redhead didn't elaborate. The blond
shrugged and decided it didn't really matter what Kuro meant.</p><P>"Come on let's go
home" He said as he began walking back towards his apartment.</p><P>"It'll be nice to
sleep in actual bed, no more bark in my hair! And it will be nice to
finally be able to clean that damn place, do you have any idea how
annoying it was for me not to able to make you clean your house!"
Kuro snapped.</p><P>"I happen to like my
house." Naruto said defensively crossing his arms.</p><P>"And I would like it
a whole lot better if I could guarantee that there was nothing else
living in it." Kuro said smiling sweetly. Naruto opened his mouth
to reply, but remembering the questionable state of his kitchen he
found there was really nothing he could say. He snapped his mouth
shut and speed up, walking back to his apartment, from behind he
could hear Kuro laughing.</p><P>- - - - - - - - - - - -
- - - -</p><P>The stairs leading up
to Naruto's apartment creaked under Kuro's footsteps. The redhead
observed them skeptically; silently daring them to try give out. The
hallway looked odd to Kuro. He had seen it before, but never with his
own eyes, and some how the lights looked dimmer and the walls
dingier. As the walked into to Naruto's apartment, Kuro found it
was just as messy as he remembered it. He followed the blond into the
small bedroom and flopped down gracefully onto the bed.</p><P>"You need a bigger
bed." He commented, before grabbing Naruto around the waist and
pulling him down, "But then again maybe you don't…" He
murmured his lips brushing against the soft junction in the blonde's
neck.</p><P>"M… Kyu." Naruto
murmured softly, his body melting into Kuro's.</p><P>"I thought you were
tired," Kuro remarked with a chuckle.</p><P>"M… I changed my
mind." The blonde replied teasingly.</p><P>Caressing the blond's
stomach softly the redhead lapped at the tan skin of the teen's
neck, his hand moving lower to knead the taunt flesh of Naruto's
ass. He gently nibbled on a tan ear, moving down slowly to map his
neck, and down to the lusciously curved neck of his former container.
He bit down with enough force to mark his mate, as Naruto let out a
moan mixture of pain and pleasure. Kuro slightly pulled away.</p><P>"Are you alright
Naruto?" He asked his breath heady with passion.</p><P>The blond nodded his
head, leaning back into the older nin's strong arms. He tilted his
head upwards and made eye contact with Kuro. His small hands reached
up to gently pull Kuro's head down towards his own. A spark shot
through both of their lips at the moment of contact. The hairs on the
back of Naruto's neck jumping to attention, while a piece of the
redhead's anatomy followed seconds after.</p><P>"Do you have any
idea what you do to me?" Kuro purred, his hands moving down to
caress the slowly awakening budge in the blonde's pants, as he
pressed his arousal upwards into a tan thigh.</p><P>"I think…I have…
a pretty good idea." Naruto replied biting his bottom lip, and
rubbing his bottom against Kuro's member.</p><P>A low growl emanated
from the back of the redhead's throat. He pushed the blond teen off
of his lap, and onto the bed, before straddling the young man, and
trapping the teen's wrists above his head with his hands.</p><P>"I don't think you
do, otherwise you wouldn't tease me. Naruto, I am very patient for
a demon, but you press my limits when you do things like that. I can
control my urges to a point, but you are pushing past that. What do
you want? Do you want me to take you right here on the bed?" Kuro
said his voice rising slightly in frustrated anger. Cerulean eyes
made contact within his own as a small smile graced the lips of his
blond angel.</p><P>"What if I said
yes?" Naruto asked softly, looking earnestly into the eyes of the
man above him.</p><P>Kuro's heart skipped
a singular beat, and an ache started just below his belly button. It
was if the rest of the world had just dropped out from under him and
all that remained was him and Naruto, at that precise moment in time.
He lowered his body down onto the lithe blond below him, pressing
their foreheads together and gazing deep into Naruto's deep
cerulean orbs.</p><P>"Naruto do you know
what you are asking from me? Is this what you want?" he asked, his
sweet heated breath flowing over the teen's hair, gently teasing
the strands. His voice filled with questioning, a composite of
emotions cloaked behind it.</p><P>Naruto closed his eyes
and took a deep breath, his eyes fluttered open in a delicate wave of
lashes, looking up into the questioning gaze of Kuro. <I>'I know
what this would mean for him… to take a mate after what happened,
is he ready, or more to the point… am I?' </I></p><P>Waiting for Naruto to
answer Kuro sighed, preparing to leave his position, if it took the
blond so long to answer then there was no doubt in his mind that he
was not ready to take the next step, and it would be unfair to
pressure him. A pair of arms wrapping around his neck suddenly
stopped Kuro from shifting his position and preparing to get up. They
tugged him back down into position as pair of plump warm lips pressed
against his own.</p><P>"Please don't
leave…" Naruto whispered softly, moving to nuzzle the redhead's
neck. A few tears gently streamed down the blond's cheeks as he
desperately clung to the older nin. "Please, don't leave me."
He choked out.</p><P>Cautiously Kuro
wrapped his arms around the lithe figure and settled back into
position. He stroked the golden blonde strands of the teen's hair,
and whispered words gently into his ear to sooth his panicked energy.
Surprisingly he felt a tug on his chakra, looking down in awe he
noticed his own chakra meshing with that of Naruto's.</p><P>The red and blue
reached out for one another, settling the two charkas firmly
together. Had one of the Hyuuga been watching they would have seen
one of the rarest phenomenon's in shinobi history. As the two
molded together the pair still did not lose their own original
energy. It was if their souls were reaching out for one another, as
if their bodies' being close to one another simply wasn't enough,
that they needed to be closer.</p><P>The older nin slowly
allowed his hand to drift up the back of the shuddering teen.
Cautiously he lifted the young mans shirt and raised it over his
lithe arms, meeting no resistance. He pressed a gentle kiss against
pale skin, gently lapping up the salty tears streaming down the
teen's cheeks. He placed his own forehead against his lover's.</p><P>"Naruto. Is this
what you want?" He asked, looking deeply into the teen's blue
eyes.</p><P>Placing a chaste kiss
on Kuro's lips Naruto nodded his head in acceptance, "More then
anything in the world."</p><P>The redhead felt his
chakra spike and soar, while Naruto's let out a howl arching his
back in delight. The blond grabbed onto Kuro, holding on as if his
life depended on it.</p><P>"What in the world
was that Kyu?" The teen panted.</p><P>"It was a show of my
love Blondie, nothing more."</p><P>"But it felt as if
the connection was inside me, like you touched every part of my body
at once." The teen gasped still trying to catch his breath.</p><P>"Oh, I can show you
what it feels like to have me inside you, that however wasn't it."
Kuro said with a wink. A blush crossed the boy's face, as a shiver
ran down his spine.</p><P>"You know what I
meant… what in the world was that?"</p><P>"Well chibi, I'd
say that it was our chakra melding together. As for the reason I'm
not quite sure yet, or why it's happening now, or how it happens at
all."</p><P>"A lot of good you
are." The teen mocked.</p><P>"Oh, but I am good…"
A sly grin crossed the foxy face; as his head dipped down to devour
the plump lips of the blond below him, "real good." Kyu remarked
as a puff of hot air slid through his lips, teasing Naruto with its
heat.</p><P>Moving to close the
distance the teen's moist lips met those of Kuro's. A slight nip
from the older nin alerted the blond to his intentions. Allowing the
man entrance Naruto moaned into the kiss as the pair of tongues took
their time in exploring one another. No matter how many times they
had kissed in the forest it had never gotten old for either of the
pair. Kyuubi not having kissed in years, and Naruto enjoying the
closeness of someone else, and the feeling of intimacy.</p><P>Kuro pulled away,
nipping down the edges of the teen's chin, moving to his neck, and
down his chest, ravaging the blonde's skin as he worked his way
down to the pair of hideously orange pants. Cringing slightly at
brightness he wasted no time in removing the offending material. He
began to kiss the skin revealed, and caress the genin's soft taunt
thighs.</p><P>A slight sheen of sweat
began to form between the pair, as Naruto's hands began to
furiously work on Kuro's pants. He tugged off the older nin's
belt, and savagely unzipped his pant's, pulling them past his knees
in one definite moment. If not for living within the teen for 15
years Kuro would have been surprised at this aggressive action, but
having known the blonde's natural animal instincts, which were only
magnified by his own influence the teen's actions were of no real
surprise to him. It was one challenge for dominance he would be happy
to participate in.</p><P>He moved his head down
to mouth the bulge in the teen's light blue boxers through the
cloth. Causing Naruto in turn to buck up widely, letting out a
rumbling noise from the back of his throat, followed by a squeak as
his boxers were removed in a flash of blue, while a devilish Kitsune
peered up at him with mirth dancing within his eyes.</p><P>The hot tongue that
swiped out to lick his heated member nearly sent the chibi toppling
off the bed in a squeal of delight. The strong hands holding him in
place by his hips however stopped his movement.</p><P>"Kyu… s-stop,
t-t-teasing me...Mm…" The teen panted as Kuro tongue danced
across his erection.</p><P>The redhead felt the
blonde tensing under his ministrations, and he quickly stopped his
actions, lest his playmate release earlier then he had planned.</p><P>"Kyu!" The teen
all but screamed out in frustration.</p><P>"Patience is a
virtue chibi."</p><P>"Well, I'm not
very virtuous," The blond growled.</p><P>"I could tell that
all by myself," Kuro remarked, his tongue gliding along the taunt
skin of the teen's stomach, marking the area where he was caged.
His lips lingered over the area of the accursed seal that stole his
freedom, no faded and broken.</p><P>He moved his body
upwards and took the plump pouting lips with his own. His teeth
nibbling on the teen's bottom lip, graciously asking for
acceptance, which was readily accepted. Breaking the kiss he cupped
the blonde's bottom, massaging the tender flesh, and squeezing,
before rubbing his erection against Naruto's member. The teen's
eyes rolled to the back of his head as he moaned into the action.
Caressing the blond the Kitsune brought his lips to the teen's ear.</p><P>"Do you have
anything I could use as lube?" He whispered huskily.</p><P>The shivering ninja
nodded his head, his senses too overloaded to allow him to speak. The
teen raised a shaky hand to point to the dresser beside the bed. Kuro
rose gracefully from the bed to rummage through the drawers, finally
coming upon a bottle of lotion. Flipping open the cap with a flick of
the wrist the elder nin moved to straddle a very red Naruto. Coating
his fingers in the substance he moved forward to press a light kiss
against a pair of pliant lips.</p><P>"Are you sure this
is what you want? Are you ready for this?" He asked in an almost
whisper.<I> 'I'm not sure if I can hold back, but I refuse to
press him… I could never do anything against his will… because…'</I>
Kuro thought.</p><P>"Yes, because…"
Naruto began. "I love you."<I> 'I love him.'</I></p><P>Their eyes met as
sparks and chakra soared, their mouths met with a clash of lips, as
the two bodies writhed together, sliding and moving like water. Kuro
moved one finger into the entrance of the teen, keeping in time with
the grinding of their bodies, showering the blonde's face with
kisses, and nuzzling the teen to provide comfort. Naruto tensed as
the second and third finger entered one after the other. It was
painful, no doubt, but it was not unbearable.</p><P>Pressing a gentle kiss
to the teen's already abused lips, the red head spread the lube
over his heated member, restraining himself from simply allowing his
hand to bring him to the peak. Caressing the blonde's thigh gently
and slowly draping his body over the teen he whispered a quiet, "Are
you ready?" Naruto nodded his head in response.</p><P>Gripping the teen's
hips gently, he slowly began to enter, his fingers kneading the soft
flesh of Naruto sides, attempting to sooth the teen through his first
time. Unknown to the teen tears began to form in the corner of his
eyes, and began to smoothly run down his cheeks. Kuro felt his heart
clench and perform a series of flips. He stopped his movement,
pausing about mid way into his blonde lover. His lips came up to kiss
away the salty tears.</p><P>"Naruto, if I'm
hurting you please tell me to stop, I don't want to make you cry, I
love you, and would never do anything to hurt you. Please, just
please don't cry." Kuro made a movement to retract himself from
the teen before he felt a pair of arms snake around his chest to hold
him in place.</p><P>"Please don't stop.
I'm not sad and you're not hurting me, I don't know why I'm
crying… but if anything they are tears of joy. You have no idea how
happy I am right now, I feel complete, with you here, you now, and us
together like this, this… connection. I just…" more hot tears
streamed down Naruto's face as he tried valiantly to explain his
feelings.</p><P>"Sh…" Kuro
whispered, gently caressing the teen's silky soft locks. "I
understand," he said placing a kiss on his lover's forehead, "I
understand."</p><P>He slowly pressed all
the way into the nin below him, hearing a low groan rumble from the
teen's chest. He experimentally explored the hot cavern, slowly
thrusting in a series of different angles until the teen let out a
gasp of delight arching his back and lurching forward to accept more
of the redhead's member into his pliable body.</p><P>"M…Ah… harder…
Nhh…Nwah! KYU!" Naruto yelled when Kuro struck the same spot
again. The small blonde was nearly weeping with joy as the older nin
continued to thrust forward, striking at the same angle again and
again.</p><P>The connection of
their chakra's only continued to enhance their enjoyment, every
feeling and emotion, as we as physical movement was intensified
tenfold. Kuro felt the coils in his abdomen tighten as Naruto mewled
and writhed so enticingly beneath him, the teen's legs wrapping
around his waist to draw him deeper into the deliciously hot cavern
only made his movements that much harder to control. He knew he was
reaching his limits, just as he knew Naruto was also drawing close to
the edge. Building his charka and wrapping it around his member he
moved to take the teen's lips as he thrust into the unbearable
tight heat one last time, his charka expending a delicious pressure
on Naruto's sweet spot.</p><P>"KYU!" Naruto
yelled as he released across their stomachs.</p><P>The heat squeezing his
member as Naruto came enhanced by the mutual connection of their
charkas caused Kuro to follow him mere milliseconds after, releasing
his seed deep within the teen.</p><P>The two collapsed into
a jumble of limbs and sticky blankets. Kuro reluctantly pulled out,
settling him beside his blonde angel, his hand moving to intertwine
their fingers together. He placed a kiss on the blonde's sweaty
forehead, shifting the golden locks from his face to gaze adorningly
into his cerulean eyes.</p><P>"I love you," he
muttered.</p><P>"Love you too
furball." Naruto replied with a smirk.</p><P>"Let's get some
sleep; you'll need all the energy you can get for the next round."</p><P>"Nani! Kyu! I can't
go again so soon, my butt's sore!" The blonde exclaimed his eyes
widening in a mixture of shock, fear, and the slightest hint of lust.</p><P>"I know plenty of
things we can do without hurting you … so just get all the rest you
can for now chibi, you'll need it." Kuro remarked, a smirk
playing on the corner of his lips.</p><P>Naruto let out a sigh
and moved to snuggle with the older nin, his damp blonde locks
spreading across a pale chest. He rested his cheek on the firm
surface and wrapped his arms around the man's waist, snuggling in
till he fell asleep. Kuro gave a small smile before falling into a
deep slumber as well; their charkas still merged and pulsing together
happily, as if their very souls were cuddling.</p><P>-----</p><P><U>AN: I apologize for

respond to your review individually I still got and appreciated it,
I'm writing this for ya'll and I can't thank you enough. </U></p><P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P><I>My eyes flicker
open as warm sunlight spills through the un-curtained window. I move
to sit up but a soft mummer accompanied by a tightening of the strong
arms wrapped around me stops my movement. I glance down at the
human's who body is tangled with mine and smile. I feel a
possessive pride as I look at the beautiful creature snuggled against
me, my mate. He must have felt my gaze because he slowly begins to
open his beautiful blue eyes. I disentangle one of my arms to stroke
his face and smile as the first word on his lips is my name. I am
disinclined to ever move again, but a small knock on the door
disturbs our peace. </I></p><P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>A loud knock startled
Naruto back to reality. He sat bolt upright, yelped, and fell
backwards off the bed. Kuro smiled before rising smoothly and pulling
on the first pair of pants that came to hand.</p><P>"What are you
doing?" Naruto cried, and Kuro raised an eyebrow.</p><P>"Answering the
door, I'm told it's the polite thing to do with someone knocks."
He resounded and Naruto glared him.</p><P>"Well then wear
you own pants!" He snapped. Kuro looked down to discover that
the pants he had grabbed were a painful shade of orange and a few
inches too short. He smirked and opened his mouth to say something
but was cut off by another loud knock. Kuro flashed his teeth before
striding through the door leaving a very naked Naruto to watch his
pants disappear into the kitchen.</p><P>He contented himself
with sitting sulkily on the floor till Kuro came back. He could hear
muffled voices through the wall but didn't care to pay attention. He
was just considering pulling on Kuro's too long pants when the
owner of the pants re-entered the room.</p><P>"It was your pink
haired friend, does she normally blush so much?" Kuro
questioned, as he stripped out of Naruto's pants and grabbed a clean
pair of his own much less remarkable ones. Watching Kuro discard his
clothing Naruto was much too busy blushing himself to answer Kuro's
question.</p><P>"She said the
Hokage would like to see us as soon as possible to discuss our new
duties." Kuro started towards the bathroom before pausing.</p><P>"I'm going to
take a quick shower, care to join me?" He inquired. Naruto
blushed again and Kuro smiled. "I'll be good," He promised,
"It'll just be faster this way." Naruto thought that Kuro
looked too innocent, but followed him into the bathroom. True to his
word Kuro behaved, but it was apparent that he would have preferred
not to.</p><P>After they had
showered, found clean clothes, found Kuro's hair tie, and healed
Naruto of his soreness they discovered that they were endanger of
trying the Hokage's patience by keeping her waiting. As they walked
towards the red tower at the center of the town Naruto was mourning
the loss of his breakfast, while Kuro was silently praising a higher
being for saving him from anymore ramen. As much as Kuro loved Naruto
he found the blonde's taste in food questionable.</p><P>The pair entered the
Hokage's office and found them fixed with her hawk like gaze.</p><P>"Naruto, as was
our agreement you are now a Chunin. The elders would prefer it if you
took on the job of guarding the village, or teaching at the academy.
They are worried that the Akatsuki view you as a target and think it
would be safest for everyone if you remained here. I think that
threat the Akatsuki present is not as prevalent as the elders believe
so I see no problem with sending you on mission with the rest of your
team. That being said, the finial choice is up to you." Her
stare was changelings, but Naruto matched her gaze.</p><P>"I won't become
Hokage by filing papers, though it might be an important skill to
know." Naruto said gesturing to the mountains of unsigned paper
work, "I would like to continue missions with my team."
Tsunade smiled and turned to Kuro.</p><P>"The elders and I
have decided that it would be unwise to allow you to run missions
outside the village, so I have assigned you a job here. You will
assist with the paper work here and on occasion be asked to guard the
gate." Kuro nodded, but never took his eyes of the Hokage.
"Izumo and Kotetsu will be arriving shortly to go over all that
your job entails with you. Naruto your team will be waiting to train
with you at training ground five. Dismissed." The Hokage's
eyes followed Kuro as he left the room, and she would have been
content to stare broodingly at the door if Shizune hadn't dumped even
more paper work on top of her desk.</p><P>"I swear it
breeds." Tsunade muttered poking one the precarious stacks.</p><P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P><U>AN: I apologize for

<br><br><h3>Chapter 12</h3><hr><br><p><u>Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto</u></p><p><u>Thanks to: Steph, </u>Liana Uchihacreepy crabTsumetai Taiyoukai9TailedNaruto94Wolfgirlward06aloukou101Ore no NarutoSony Boy<u> for reviewing, I loved every single one.</u></p><i><hr size=1 width=100% noshade></i>
<p><i>Ramen has become less of a staple and more of I treat. I didn't notice at first, but one night it hit me, we never eat ramen unless I'm the one who decides what we eat. Though I am happy to trade in my ramen eating life style for Kuro and all the joys of being loved. There is nothing as satisfying as laying wrapped in Kuro's warm arms as I drift to sleep at night.</i></p><p><i>I am completely content or at least I was until today.</i></p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Anger surged through Kuro and he fought to keep his voice calm.
<p>"What?" Despite his efforts the word came out with dangerous an overtone. Naruto looked surprised that Kuro should be anything but thrilled by the information.</p><p>"I said that I'm being sent on a mission to bring Sasuke back, the information that we have almost guarantees success." Kuro's glare deepened as Naruto spoke.</p><p>"Until the ungrateful bastard tries to kill you again." He snapped, Naruto's face darken a little.</p><p>"He's not going to try to kill me." The blond said coolly.</p><p>"That's a sound assumption." Kuro sneered, "What did you base that on? How he acted the last two times you spoke?" Naruto glared.</p><p>"He didn't kill me either time, though I'm sure you'll admit he had plenty of chances. You're the one he defeated both times after all." Kuro looked as if he'd been slapped.</p><p>"Let me try again, I can assure you that he won't be so lucky a third time. I don't have the same… <i>limitations</i> after all." It was Naruto's turn to look affronted.</p><p>"Oh so that's what this is about. Your angry that a mere human was able to defeat you. It's really not a surprise he is an Uchiha after all, they seem to have a way of getting the better of you." The words slipped from his mouth and in his anger he didn't even realize how close he'd come to the one subject they never spoke about; Kuro dead kit.</p><p>"Yes Uchihas tend to have a way of harming those I hold dear, though I'm more angry that you're willing to risk your life to 'save' a man that has tried to kill you twice already!" Naruto's eyes narrowed, he had expected Kuro to be happy for him.</p><p>"Perhaps your jealous, are you worried that Sasuke might take your place? Don't worry Sasuke and I aren't like you and your <i>friend</i> Izumo." Kuro looked flabbergasted.</p><p>"Izumo and I are <b>just</b> friends! I could never betray you like that! I'm hardly jealous of a traitor like that Uchiha you're trying so desperately to get back. I just don't understand how you can care for someone who would love to kill you." Kuro cried. The idea that Naruto didn't trust him hurt more then the fact he wouldn't listen to him. Naruto's twisted his face into sneer.</p><p>"No I wouldn't expect a <i>demon</i> like you to understand what it means to really care about someone." With that Naruto turned and stormed out of the apartment. As the door slammed Kuro hit the floor with a dull thud. He'd been stabbed before, but that hurt was nothing compared to the pain compressing his chest now. He'd thought that Naruto knew just how much he loved him. He'd thought that Naruto knew that he would never even think about another ever again. He'd thought... but he had been wrong. He curled up on the floor, but no tears would come and sleep was equally elusive. There was nothing except for Naruto's words echoing in his head.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Naruto stormed down the street anger blocked any remorse that he might have felt for the things he had said. The village proved too crowd for Naruto's restless mind and he soon found himself racing through the emerald trees of the forest surrounding the town. Running seemed to calm his thoughts and he was soon able to settle beside a creek. Finally guilt over what he had said caught up with him. How could he accuse Kuro of cheating or not knowing what it was like to care for someone? Sudden he was overcome with the desire to apologize and sprung to his feet, but when he turned he came face to face with someone unexpected.
<p>"Senpai is this Kyuubi container?" The man with the orange masked asked.</p><p>"Yup! Itachi is going to be mad, un!" Came the reply and before Naruto had time to respond dark consumed him.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade></p><p><u>AN: I apologize for the late update, I seem to be doing that a lot lately. Hopefully the next one comes out faster! Thanks for reading! -Morana</u></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 13</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer: I don't
own anything that you recognize from somewhere else.</p><P>Thanks to:
itachisgurl93, aloukou101, Evil Ball of Fluff, Silvermane1, Tsumetai
Taiyoukai, Witty Remark who all reviewed, I only write this story
because of ya'll.</p><P>Side note: There may be
stray letters through out this update. Why? You ask. Because my mom's
new kitten, Neko, decided that he wanted to walk on the keyboard. I
did my best to find and fix all of Neko's notes but I may have
missed a few.</p><P>--</p><P><I>I lay in the dim
house on the floor no light spills through the eastern facing
windows. Some part of mind remains rational enough to wonder if they
wondered about me when I didn't return to work after lunch, but
this small part goes unnoticed in the wild turmoil of the rest of my
mind. His accusations echo through the kitchen and I watch again and
again as the conversion ends the same way. </I></p><P><I>Why, my angel, did
you leave me? Perhaps it is my fault one so kind as you would never
think such thoughts unless I gave you reason to. I swear angel I love
none but you.</I></p><P>--</p><P>Kuro lay on the floor
his only comfort was that Naruto had to come back, even if it was
only to tell him to leave. The thought that Naruto might not want him
around anymore made Kuro's chest clench painfully.</p><P>Kuro's heart leapt
when he heard a knock on the door, but it fell when he remembered
that Naruto wouldn't knock. He lay there wrapped in self-pity till
the growing intensity of the knocks roused him from the floor. He
opened the door to find Izumo and Kotetsu standing there.</p><P>Naruto's words
echoed through his mind and he gave his friend a cold look.</p><P>"I told Izumo there
was nothing to worry about! I said that you probably ran into your
little blond at lunch and decided to have him instead! But Izumo said
it was weird that Naruto wasn't at the meeting to get information
on the latest 'bring back Sasuke' mission." Kotetsu rattled off
before Kuro could even open his mouth. Kuro continued glaring at
Izumo, who shifted uncomfortably, till something Kotetsu had said
sunk in.</p><P>"Naruto wasn't at
the mission meeting?" He asked sharply. Kotetsu looked shocked.</p><P>"No I thought…"
But Kuro brushed past him and out the door. Irrational fear spread
through his body. What would make Naruto miss the very meeting that
had started their fight?</p><P>--</p><P>Slowly consciousness
returned to Naruto. He opened his eye and though his vision was still
blurry he thought he saw two figures.</p><P>"Senpai he's
awake!" One of the people called.</p><P>"Then knock him out
again, un!" The man who had spoken fist moved towards Naruto and
his world went dark again.</p><P>--</p><P>The worry Kuro had
felt was full-blown panic now. The last anyone had seen Naruto he had
been heading out of the village looking angry. Izumo had caught up to
Kuro, but he was wise enough to follow quietly while the
temperamental redhead had his fit.</p><P>The two of them
followed the fading charka trial down to the bank of a stream. Kuro
froze when he picked up two other vaguely familiar charka residues.</p><P>Anger and fear surged
through his body as he recognized the charka. What would that group
do to Naruto if they found that he no longer had a demon in him? It
seemed unlikely that they would just let him go.</p><P>Kuro charka flared to
match his mood and his body began to shake. He wouldn't be able to
hold his human form much longer. Snarling he moved to run down the
faint trail left by Naruto's attackers, but a firm hand stopped
him.</p><P>"Let go Izumo." He
said warningly, killing his friend would only further dampen his day.</p><P>"I know you're
angry, I would be to if it were Kotetsu, but you have to wait till
the Hokage organizes a search party and…" Kuro cut him off.</p><P>"And what? Wait for
the trail to fade? It's half gone all ready. Wait for the elders to
tell me I can't leave the village? You know they will. Wait for the
Akatsuki to try and suck out Naruto's soul? You know as well as I
do that will kill him! No Izumo I won't wait!" With that he tour
his arm away from Izumo's grip and ran. He would teach the Akatsuki
to regret harming his angel.</p><P>--</p><P>Four men sat in a dark
room, though only three were obviously human. All eyes were on the
crumpled form in the middle of the room.</p><P>"I don't see what
the big deal was, un." One man said, "It was more trouble getting
my Jinchuuriki then him, un."</p><P>"You should have
waited. Now we have the task of restraining him till we have the
means and the power to remove his demon. Also, I don't think Konoha
will remain ignorant of his absence for long. Nor do I think that
they will be willing to over look it." Another man said coolly. His
eyes turned a blood red to better examine the young man in the middle
of the room. Too his red his there was faint blue glow pulsing around
the blond. Looking closer the man expected to see an even fainter
red, but it wasn't there. No matter how hard he looked he couldn't
even find a trace which meant…</p><P>"You fool! Where is
the demon?" The blond he was talking to looked confused.</p><P>"Itachi that is the
Kyuubi container." The shark-faced man beside Itachi said in a tone
that questioned his partner's sanity. Itachi rounded on him,
somehow managing to do so without ever losing his composer.</p><P>"That <B>was</B> the
container, but the demon isn't there anymore. So I'll ask you
again. Where is it?"</p><P>--</p><P>AN: So Kyuubi is an
extremist, I figure that demons don't do anything halfheartedly.
Damn I see why people write het! There are too many "he's" in
this story! This really should have been up almost a week ago, but
I'm moving and accidentally packed the notebook it was written in.
Needless to say my parents weren't thrill to find me riffling
franticly through my neatly packed boxes for it. Aw well. Thanks for
reading.</p>

He will burn; I just hope I don't freeze to death first. </i></p><p>----</p><p>Itachi watched as Naruto's face filled with fear and then hope. He almost smiled as he watched the hope flicker like a candle in the wind.</p><p>"Where is the demon?" Itachi voice was still the smooth careless drawl of an aristocrat despite his years in less civilized company. He enjoyed the confusion and horror that danced on the boys face.</p><p>"W-what are you t-talking about?" Naruto stuttered. Itachi face remained frozen, but a slight tightening around his eyes betrayed his annoyance.</p><p>"Don't play the fool. It's a simple question." There was a snort drawing Naruto's attention to the man at Itachi side.</p><p>"Perhaps he's not playing, un." The man's blond hair tumbled down into his face and Naruto recognized him at once and he snarled softly.</p><p>"See, he's nothing more then that beast. He and Tobi would get along great, they seem to be of the same intelligence, un." Deidara said cheerfully he visiable blue eye dancing with mirth. Itachi sighed softly, but otherwise ignored the other man.</p><p>"He knows, maybe he just needs to be reminded." Itachi looked as though 'reminding' Naruto would give him no pleasure, Deidara on the other hand looked thrilled.</p><p>"Yes! Let me reminded him, un!" Deidara reached down into the bag on his belt.</p><p>"No!" Itachi voice was sharp, "We need him to talk not to be turned into 'art'." Deidara looked sulky, but Itachi ignored him.</p><p>"Kisame." He didn't raise his voice, but his blue skinned partner materialized at his side. Their eyes met and Kisame smiled in understanding. Deidara muttered something about letting Kisame have all the fun, but he didn't look too upset by it.</p><p>Naruto watched with apprehension has Kisame unwrapped his sword.</p><p>"He'll kill you all." He said defiantly. Kisame snorted and lowered his blade.</p><p>Naruto screamed and Deidara laughed.</p><p>---</p><p>Kyuubi paused; his entire being was as tight as a drawn bow. He drew his lips back away from his long white teeth. They were hurting his Naruto he could feel it. It felt like his soul was being torn to pieces and he howled in rage.</p><p>---</p><p>Itachi head snapped up as he heard the howl so close to the cave. He knew it was no ordinary howl and he could feel the murderous intent and blazing charka. He glanced in disgust and the boy who lay panting and bloody on the floor.</p><p>"Deidara come." He said standing. He knew what was coming and he knew that currently they stood no change against it. He would leave Tobi and Kisame behind to hold the creature up and if necessary he would leave Deidara later.</p><p>Deidara stood his face questioning, but Itachi ignored him as the swept from the cave. He was not going to be killed here by a vengeful demon.</p><u><hr size=1 width=100% noshade></u>

<p><i>My body burns with angry rage. The fire of my charka brings red to my eyes, blurring thoughts and vision. Fear pulse behind the rage. Fear that I am already to late. That I will lose my light, my angel. But I refuse to dwell it one it. I must not waste time and energy with fear, I must find my love. </i></p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Glowing red eyes fixed themselves on the entrance to a cave. Kyuubi snarled, he could feel only three charka signatures in the cave. One average, one increasingly strong, and the barely clinging to life. Kyuubi's own charka flared with rage when he recognized the fading one. The ground shook as he ran across towards the cave. To figures appeared at the entrance, but it was obvious that they were not the one Kyuubi was looking for and he brushed them aside. Well really he slammed then into the rock wall. One figure crumbled and did not rise, the other reach for his sword and watched Kyuubi with greedy eyes.

<p>Kyuubi ignored the swordsman and ran into the cave. There on the center of the floor lay Naruto. His clothes were ripped and blood stained and his breathing was ragged. Kyuubi's world ran red, and he rounded on the swordsman.</p><p>"You." His voice was coarse, and deep. He tore through the man's blue flesh only vaguely aware of the man's sword trying to the same to him. He turned to the young man who watched him from the floor and with great difficulty forced himself back into his human form.</p><p>"Kyu." Naruto rasped out, "You came."</p><p>"Shh don't hurt yourself, and of coarse I came! I said I loved you didn't I?" Gently he cupped Naruto' face that was pale with blood loss.</p><p>"I thought... maybe... you would... be mad at me." Naruto coughed. Kuro furred his brow, all traces of his anger were disappearing. His angel was safe and the ones who had hurt him were dead.</p><p>"I could never be so mad at you that I wouldn't love you. And I will always come for you for as long as you want me." Naruto tried to say something in response but winced in pain instead.</p><p>"Here, let me help you." Gently as though he was handling a new born kitten Kuro cradled Naruto in his arms wrapping him in his warm red chakra. Naruto gasped softly as the foreign energy entered his body. Subconsciously Naruto weakened chakra reached towards Kuro bring the other man into his very soul.</p><p>"My love, my sweet love, I will never leave you."</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade><b><i><u>The End</u></i></b></p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>AN: I am aware that is the most pathic ending chapter ever, but the story really was suppose be only 5 chapters long according to my outline. So now I'm done, I hope you liked it, and I hope the ending was "happy" enough, happy ending aren't really my thing. So I love you all for reading, but this is the end.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 16</h3><hr><br><p>I hope I didn't get anyone's hopes up. This isn't a chapter; it's an Author's note. What I have to tell you might interest some of you. I am writing a sequel, because of all your reviews, practically DragonSaphira, made me feel too guilty to leave the story at that.</p><p>However I will tell you this. The next story I have planned is short and it's not going to have a happy ending. You all saw how horrid I am at those. The sequel will be up soon as I finish writing the first chapter. I hope you read the sequel and enjoy as much as many of you claim to have enjoyed this one!</p><p>OH! And because I am in a good mood, a big bowl of ice-cream will do that to a person, I will give you the first two paragraphs of the sequel "Courting The Devil"!</p><p><i>"For as long as you want me." Was what Kuro had said and oh how Naruto wanted him. He failed to even take notice of the fact that Kuro was the Kyuubi, it didn't matter he loved him for what he was. A monster and a man. </i></p><p><i>Even on the warmest summer night Naruto would lay entwined with Kuro warmth, desperate to never lose the feeling of being the most important thing in the universe. This morning was no different.</i></p><p><i>Tried from his last mission Naruto hadn't said much to Kuro when he'd come home last night, but the man had seemed to understand. He has stroked Naruto wild hair till Naruto has fallen into a restful sleep. Now as Naruto's eye fluttered he found Kuro already awake, with a small smile on his face. Naruto yawned sitting up and tried to shake the sleep from his eyes. </i></p><p>Ok I so I lied it was three paragraphs I'm sure you're all heartbroken.</p>
