Kyuubi are the new students at Shinobi Academy for Boys. What
happens when they are considered 'inhumanly pretty and cute' by most
of the student body, especially two Uchihas?</P></p><p align='center'>XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX</P><P>"Come on Kyuu-nii! Hurry up or we'll
be late!" Naruto yelled through they're house to his older brother,
Kyuubi. He had big, bright cerulean eyes, three small whisker marks
on his cheeks, and short blond, spiky, messed up hair. He was wearing
the school uniform of his and his brother's new school, Shinobi
Academy for Boys, which was a black school shirt with the Leaf
Village symbol in white on it and black pants.</P><P>"I'm coming Naru!" yelled Kyuubi in
reply. He had big, bright scarlet eyes, five slightly bigger marks on
his cheeks, and extremely long blond hair that was kept in a low
ponytail and the tips of it was blood red. He was about a foot taller
than Naruto. He was wearing the uniform as well.</P><P>Naruto nodded and waited for his
brother to come out of the bathroom. He ran for the door as soon as
Kyuubi came out. Kyuubi followed.</P><P>The two brothers ran out of the
apartment and down the street towards they're new school. They had
just moved there from the Sand Village and had bought an apartment in
the Leaf Village. They were 13 (Naruto) and 16 (Kyuubi).</P><P>They ran until they reached the
entrance of the school. "Whoa! Look at this place! Its so big!"
Naruto exclaimed while staring around at huge castle-like place that
was there school.</P><P>Kyuubi looked around too and said,
"Yeah. Now come on. We need to go to our classes."</P><P>Naruto nodded and followed Kyuubi into
the building. The inside of the building looked just as castle-like
as the outside. Kyuubi walked towards the principals office while
Naruto followed.</P><P>They went in and saw a black haired
lady with a pig sitting at a desk. The lady looked up when the two
boys walked in. "Why hello there! You two cuties must be our new
transfer students from the Sand Village, Naruto and Kyuubi, right?"
asked the lady.</P><P>Naruto and Kyuubi both nodded. The lady
smiled. "Alright then, here is your schedules and maps of the
school. And by the way, my name is Shizune." said Shizune as she
handed Naruto and Kyuubi each a map and a schedule. "And I put your
lockers right next to each other so you can see each other during the
day." she said.</P><P>Naruto smiled at her. "Thank you, Ms.
Shizune."</P><P>Shizune smiled at him and then nodded
to Kyuubi and then turned back to doing whatever she was doing
before.</P><P>The two brothers walked out of the room
and into the hall. Both boys opened they're schedules and looked
inside. "Okay, for 1st period I have Math with
Kurenai-sensei. What do you have?" Naruto said.</P><P>"I have Reading with Iruka-sensei."
Kyuubi said.</P><P>"Well, I'll see you later Kyuu-nii!"
said Naruto as he turned to leave to his first class.</P><P>Kyuubi nodded at Naruto and said,
"Alright! See ya' Naru!" while walking off to his first class.</P><P><I><U><B>With Naruto</B></U></I></P><P>Naruto walked through the empty halls of Shinobi Academy for Boys
looking for his Math class.</P><P>After plenty of wandering he found it in the end of a hallway. He
knocked on the door and waited for an answer. He got one in the form
of a feminine voice saying "Come in."</P><P>Naruto pushed open the door and walked into the classroom. Almost
immediately all the noise in the room stopped and everyone turned to
stare at him. Naruto blushed heavily at this and then turned to
Kurenai. "Um...Hi. I'm one of the new transfer students, Naruto
Uzumaki. My brother, Kyuubi Uzumaki isn't in my grade." he said
nervously, painfully aware of the stares he was getting from his
classmates.</P><P>Kurenai smiled at him and said, "Hello Naruto-kun. Please go sit by
Kiba-kun and ask him what we are doing in class right now."</P><P>Naruto
nodded and turned to the class. <I>I
wonder who Kiba is, </I>he
thought. Kurenai didn't notice his confusion and started to teach the
class again.</P><P>The class noticed his confusion. A messy brown haired boy with two
red triangles on his cheeks yelled, "Hey! Over here!" at Naruto.</P><P>Naruto heard him and walked over to Kiba while trying to ignore the
stares he was still getting. He sat down in the chair next to Kiba,
behind a raven haired boy, in front of a long haired brunette boy,
and across from a brunette with his hair pulled up in a high
ponytail.</P><P>"Hey." Naruto said to the people who were surrounding him. Kiba
smirked at him, the raven boy ignored him, the long haired brunette
just stared with a weird look on his face, and the other brunette was
asleep.</P><P>"Hey little uke. You're really cute, you know that?" said Kiba as
he continued to smirk at Naruto.</P><P>Naruto flushed an embarrassed shade of red at Kiba's comment and his
new nickname. Kiba's smirk widened. "You look even cuter when
you're embarrassed."</P><P>Naruto somehow got redder and said, "I'm not a uke. And I'm not
cute either." he pouted.</P><P>Kiba and the long haired brunette laughed. "Yes you are. You
practically scream 'uke'. You look too cute and harmless and
vulnerable and fuckable to be a seme." Kiba said. The brunette
turned towards Kiba and Naruto and nodded.</P><P>Naruto was red enough to rival a tomato now. "..." He couldn't
find anything to say to that.</P><P>Kiba's smirk widened. "See? You didn't say no so you agree with
me." he said.</P><P>Naruto pouted again and said stubbornly. "I'm not a uke."</P><P>Kiba and the brunette sighed. Then the brunette smirked. He reached
over his seat and Naruto's desk and placed his hand on Naruto's
crotch. Naruto went about five shades redder than a person should be
able to go and quickly swatted away the brunette's hand. "S-S-Stop
it..." he trailed off at the end, not knowing the brunette's name.</P><P>Said boy laughed and said, "See? You are a uke. And my name is
Neji."</P><P>Naruto's face returned to normal and he pouted again. "No I'm not."
he said under his breath.</P><P>Kiba
and Neji laughed at him. "Sure you're not Naru-chan. And by the
way, the people around you are all my friends. You know me and Neji
but the boy next to Neji is Shikamaru. And the boy behind you is
Sasuke.
Shikamaru is always asleep so don't worry about him and Sasuke is a
bastard so don't worry about him either. We have more friends but
they aren't in our class right now." Kiba explained.</P><P>Naruto nodded and turned towards the sleeping boy. He poked Shikamaru
with a pencil he randomly found until he woke up.</P><P>Shikamaru sleepily woke up and yawned to himself. "What?" he
asked and then turned to see who had poked him awake. "Who are
you?"</P><P>"I'm sorry for waking you up. I'm Naruto Uzumaki, a new student.
Nice to meet you, Shikamaru." Naruto greeted.</P><P>Shikamaru nodded and then yawned again and then went back to sleep.
Kiba and Neji sweat dropped anime style. Naruto just giggled to
himself. He felt Kiba and Neji staring at him again and started to
squirm a little under both of they're gazes.</P><P>Naruto then turned towards the raven haired boy sitting behind him.
"Hey Sasuke." he said, already sure that the boy knew who he was.</P><P>Sasuke looked at him with his onyx eyes and said "Hn".</P><P>Naruto looked confused. "Hn? What does that mean? Is that even a
word?" Naruto asked.</P><P>Neji sighed. "Sasuke talks like that all the time. He is
anti-social and hates talking to other people so he answers by saying
'Hn' when its not necessary for him to answer." he explained for
the raven boy.</P><P>Sasuke said "Hn" again.</P><P>Naruto looked at Neji for a translation.</P><P>"He says that he agrees with what I said." Neji translated.
Naruto made an 'O' with his mouth and then blushed when Neji started
to stare again.</P><P>"Wh-what is it Neji-san?" Naruto asked as he fidgeted under the
brunette's piercing white-eyed pupil less gaze.</P><P>Neji
stared dreamily at Naruto. "Why are you so cute and adorable? Its
almost inhuman-like for a person
to be this cute. Every little thing you do makes me want to jump
you." Neji said subconsciously, probably not even aware of what he
was saying.</P><P>Naruto went tomato red again and said, "Um...I-I don't kn-know. And
what does 'jump you' mean? Is that like on a trampoline?" Naruto
asked a little too innocently, his eyes glowing brightly with
curiosity.</P><P>Neji made a shocked face and then laughed to himself. "No. Thats
not what it means but I'll show you what it means if you meet me
behind the cafeteria at lunch." Neji smirked at Naruto.</P><P>Naruto was a little unnerved by the action but nodded.</P><P>Neji's smirk grew and he turned back around, just in time to see
Kurenai staring at them. "Neji-kun, what are you doing with
Naruto-kun?" she asked.</P><P>Neji smiled innocently and said, "I'm helping Inuzuka help
Naruto-kun."</P><P>Kurenai glowered a little and looked behind Neji and at Naruto and
Kiba. "Is this true?" she asked them.</P><P>Naruto started to shake his head 'no' but stopped when Kiba kicked
him in the leg. Naruto gave a small yelp that was barely audible and
tried to glare at Kiba but it looked a lot more like an angry pout.
Kiba turned to Kurenai and said innocently, "Yes, it is."</P><P>Kurenai turned back to the board and Kiba turned back to Naruto. A
bright blush appeared on his face when he saw Naruto, who was still
angry pouting/glaring.</P><P>"What was that for!?!" Naruto hissed violently at Kiba. Kiba
didn't say anything but kept staring and blushing at Naruto.</P><P>Naruto's face transformed into one of worry and he reached over and
shook Kiba a little with his small hands. "Kiba! Kiba! Kiba-san,
please say something!" Naruto begged through a whisper. Kiba
suddenly broke out of his trance and pulled Naruto to him and hugged
him.</P><P>"K-Kiba-san? Wh-what are you doing?" Naruto whispered at Kiba as
the boy continued to hold him.</P><P>Kiba smiled at him. "Hugging you. Why?" he asked without letting
go of the blond.</P><P>Naruto squirmed against Kiba which made him hold him even tighter.
"Because we're in the middle of a class and you aren't suppose to
hug me while we're in class." Naruto explained in his little
innocent way.</P><P>Kiba smiled. "So I can't hug you in class? Can I do it outside of
class?" Kiba asked.</P><P>Naruto looked thoughtful for a moment. "I don't know. I guess you
can." Naruto said, not knowing why Kiba wanted to hug him.</P><P>Kiba grinned. "Okay Naru-chan." he said and let go of the blond.
Said boy fell on the floor when Kiba let him go and landed with a
loud 'thump!'.</P><P>The whole class heard him fall and looked at Naruto who was laying on
the floor rubbing his butt. He gave a slight whine and said, "Ow!
Kiba, that hurt!"</P><P>The class looked from Naruto to Kiba. "What? I didn't mean for you
to fall. You did it yourself!" he said.</P><P>Naruto huffed. "Still it was your fault." he said.</P><P>Kiba laughed at him and bent down to pick him up. Naruto cringed back
and said, "Don't you pick me up! You're just gonna drop me again!"</P><P>Kiba looked hurt. "I didn't drop you the first time!" he yelled.</P><P>Naruto angry pouted/glared again. "Yes you did!"</P><P>Kiba was in his 'staring at Naruto's cuteness' trance and didn't say
anything back.</P><P>Naruto looked worried again but didn't try to wake Kiba up because he
was scared he was going to get hugged and dropped again so he stood
up and went back to his seat.</P><P>As soon as he sat down he felt a new pair of eyes on him and turned
to see the raven haired boy looking at him. Naruto felt especially
unnerved by Sasuke's gaze but said, "What is it, Sasuke-san?"</P><P>Sasuke smirked. "Dobe." was all he said.</P><P>Naruto blushed an angry red and said, "Shut up teme."</P><P>Sasuke's smirk disappeared and he scowled. "You clumsy
usuratonkachi."</P><P>Naruto glared in his childish way. "Stoic ice bastard."</P><P>Sasuke looked shocked and then he smirked at Naruto. "You know, I
like that about you. You're good at name calling. Do it more often,
little uke boy." he said.</P><P>Naruto's angry blush turned into an embarrassed one and he said,
"Th-thank you, I guess. And I'm not a uke." he said.</P><P>Sasuke smirked widened. "Yes you are."</P><P>Naruto huffed cutely and turned away from Sasuke. If Naruto had
turned around he would have seen a pink blush spread across the raven
boy's face.</P><P><I><U><B>With Kyuubi</B></U></I></P><P><U>(Meanwhile)</U></P><P>Kyuubi walked through the hallway, looking for Iruka's class. He had
been walking through the halls for about five minutes and he still
couldn't find it, even with the map.</P><P>"Where is this damn classroom?!?" he yelled to himself. He was
hopelessly lost even though he hadn't been in the school for very
long.</P><P>"What class are you talking about, un?" said a voice that came
from down the hall.</P><P>Kyuubi froze and looked around for the owner of the voice. As he did
he heard a different voice, "Yeah, they have a lot of fucking
classrooms in this motherfucking school."</P><P>Kyuubi continued to look around for the owners of the voices since he
couldn't see any people. "Who's there and where are you?" he
yelled, addressing both of the voices and anyone else who was with
them.</P><P>A group of teenagers that looked about Kyuubi's age appeared to
appear out of nowhere. Kyuubi jumped back in surprise as he stared
wide eyed at the teens. "Whoa! How did you do that?!?" he asked
in amazement.</P><P>A white haired teen with pink eyes smirked and said, "None of your
fucking business bitch." Kyuubi recognized his voice as the one
who was cursing earlier.</P><P>A blond haired teen with his hair separated into ponytails with one
ponytail covering his left eye and blue eyes smacked the white haired
teen in the back of the head, causing the white haired one to grunt
loudly and say, "What the fuck! What the fuck was that for you
motherfucking bastard!"</P><P>The blond one smacked him again and said "Hidan! Quit cursing so
much around the new kid, un! And he's not a bitch!" Kyuubi
recognized him as the other one who had talked.</P><P>The boy named Hidan cursed again and said, "Yes he is! He looks
like a girl so he's a bitch, just like you, bitch."</P><P>Kyuubi glared at Hidan. Both he and the blond haired boy both said,
"I'm not a bitch!" at the same time.</P><P>Kyuubi and the boy blinked in surprise at each other. The blond
laughed lightly. "Hey! My name's Deidara, un. The jerk over there
is Hidan," at that comment Hidan said, "Shut the fuck up!"
Deidara laughed at him and then pointed to the other people who were
with them. "These are our other friends, un, Sasori," he said as
he pointed to a short red haired boy that looked like he belonged in
Naruto's grade.</P><P>Sasori nodded at him.</P><P>Deidara then pointed at a taller boy with scars and stitches all over
his body. "Thats Kakuzu, un."</P><P>Kakuzu grinned at him and said, "Do you have any money?"</P><P>Kyuubi nodded and went into his pocket and pulled out five dollars.
"Yeah, why?"</P><P>Kakuzu's eyes sparkled. "Can I have it?!?!?" he asked.</P><P>Kyuubi was confused but nodded and gave Kakuzu the five dollar bill.
Kakuzu grinned happily at Kyuubi. "Do you have a lot of money?"</P><P>Kyuubi nodded. "Yes but its not with me. Me and my little brother,
Naruto, were adopted by a rich dude that recently died so we have all
his money."</P><P>Kakuzu's grin grew. "Can I have some of that too?"</P><P>Kyuubi was about to say 'yes' when the back of Deidara's hand flew
over his mouth. "Don't say yes! Kakuzu will just keep asking until
he takes all of your money,un. He loves money." Deidara explained.</P><P>Kakuzu
glared daggers at Deidara. "Why you have to tell him that! I was
just starting to like him even more! He's cute, pretty, <I>and
</I>rich!"
Kakuzu exclaimed.</P><P>Kyuubi blushed a light shade of red and said, "I'm not cute or
pretty!"</P><P>Kakuzu stopped glaring at Deidara and turned to Kyuubi. "Yes you
are. You're a cute little uke boy and I bet you're brother is too. Is
he just as rich as you or do you have more money than him? Either way
I'm gonna get some more money out of you two." Kakuzu said.</P><P>"I'm not a uke and my brother isn't either! And leave us alone
about money! You're not getting anymore!" Kyuubi yelled at Kakuzu,
getting mad that he included his brother in the conversation as well.</P><P>Kakuzu was about to yell something back before Deidara covered his
mouth with his hand. Kakuzu quickly swatted away his hand and gave a
small yell. "What the hell Deidara?!? Did you forget about your
hands or something!?!"</P><P>"Oh. Sorry about that, un. Yeah, I did forget." Deidara said
sheepishly.</P><P>Kyuubi looked confused. "What's wrong with your hands?"</P><P>Deidara smiled. And moved his ponytail away from his eye and showed
Kyuubi his palms. Kyuubi gasped. Deidara's left eye was completely
mechanical and he had mouths in his hands. "Now do you see whats
wrong with my hands, un?"</P><P>Kyuubi nodded. Deidara smiled again, "Anyway, this is Zetsu, un."
he continued while pointing at a boy with green hair and one white
eye and one gold eye (1).</P><P>Zetsu smiled. "Hey Kyuu-chan."</P><P>Kyuubi smiled at him and then blushed at the nickname.</P><P>"This is Tobi,un." Deidara said as he pointed to a short boy with
brown messy hair and an orange swirl for a mask on his face.</P><P>"Hello Kyuubi-senpai! You're really pretty, just like
Deidara-senpai! Tobi is happy to meet you!" said Tobi as he
energetically waved his hand at Kyuubi.</P><P>Kyuubi smiled and Deidara glared. "Shut up Tobi."</P><P>"Is Tobi a good boy?" asked Tobi to Kyuubi.</P><P>Kyuubi smiled at him and said, "Yes, Tobi is a good boy."</P><P>"Yay!" said Tobi as he jumped around happily.</P><P>Deidara sighed and turned to a boy with spiky orange hair and
piercings all over his face. "This is Pein,un."</P><P>Pein nodded in greeting. Kyuubi returned the gesture.</P><P>"This is Kisame,un." Deidara said a he pointed to a boy with
sharp blue hair, sharp teeth, gills on the sides of his face, and
shark eyes (2).</P><P>Kyuubi's eyes widened as Kisame lumbered over him and he shrunk
behind Deidara. "Why does he look so much like a shark?" he asked
Deidara.</P><P>Deidara shrugged. "Dunno."</P><P>Kisame grinned down at Kyuubi. "Hey there little uke-chan!"</P><P>Kyuubi silently fumed at the nickname people kept on giving him but
was too scared of the shark boy to say it out loud. "Hey
Kisame-san." Kyuubi said.</P><P>Kisame grinned again.</P><P>"And finally, Kyuubi, this is Itachi,un. He has a brother at this
school too, Sasuke. Maybe, Naruto knows Sasuke,un?" Deidara said as
he pointed at a tall raven haired boy with long hair tied in the same
style as his own and onyx eyes.</P><P>Kyuubi subconsciously blushed at the boy and said, "H-Hi
Itachi-san." He silently cursed himself for stuttering.</P><P>Itachi nodded to him and said, "Hn"</P><P>Kyuubi looked confused. He turned to Deidara. "Whats 'Hn'?"</P><P>Deidara laughed. "Thats a sound that Itachi makes when he doesn't
feel like saying something,un. I'll translate for you. He said
'Hello'."</P><P>Kyuubi made an 'O' with his mouth and asked, "Do you guys know
where Iruka-sensei's class is? I'm suppose to go there but I can't
find it."</P><P>"Yeah. You're close to it. We'll show you where it is." said
Sasori as he stepped up to Kyuubi with a small smile.</P><P>Kyuubi smiled back. "Alright."</P><P>Sasori nodded and headed off down a random corridor. Kyuubi and the
others followed.</P><P>After another minute of random hallways and corridors they arrived at
Iruka's class. "Thank you guys. And by the way, shouldn't you be in
class? And what class do you all have?" Kyuubi asked.</P><P>Deidara smiled. "Your welcome. And yeah but we don't like going to
class,un." he explained.</P><P>"Yeah, its fucking boring. Theres nothing to fucking do in his
got-damn class." Hidan cursed.</P><P>"Did you try listening to what he was saying?" Kyuubi asked.</P><P>Hidan looked sheepish. "...No..."</P><P>Kyuubi smirked. "Then go to class, try that, and then come and tell
me if class was still boring." he said.</P><P>Hidan smirked. "Okay, Kyuu-chan!"</P><P>Kyuubi blushed at the name and punched Hidan for calling him that.
"I'm not a girl." he stated simply.</P><P>"You look like a girl so you should be called 'chan'. Its either
that or 'bitch'. Choose one." Hidan said.</P><P>Kyuubi looked at him in disbelief. "I'm not a girl!" he yelled.</P><P>"Then I'll choose one for you, bitch." Hidan said. He was punched
in the face by an enraged Kyuubi.</P><P>"I'm not a fucking girl!" he yelled.</P><P>Hidan backed away slowly. "Okay, okay. I won't call you 'bitch'. So
that means I'll call you Kyuu-chan!" he said and then ducked as
Kyuubi threw another punch at him. "I won't call you anything else.
You're too cute and pretty to be called 'kun', I'm older than you so
I'm not calling you 'senpai', and I hate formal stuff so no 'san'
either." he explained.</P><P>Kyuubi blushed lightly at the compliment and then sighed. "Fine
then, you can call me 'Kyuu-chan'."</P><P>Hidan grinned. "O.K.!"</P><P>Kyuubi sighed again and said, "So what class do you have now?" he
asked all of them.</P><P>"We all have Iruka-sensei's class." said Pein.</P><P>Kyuubi grinned. "Awesome! Then we all have the same class!"</P><P>Deidara smiled. "Yeah but its been awhile since we have been in any
class,un. So you go first!" he said and pushed Kyuubi through the
door.</P><P>Kyuubi whined and stopped in front of a whole class of students and a
teacher who all stared at him like he was crazy. Kyuubi laughed
nervously. "Heh heh...Hi. I'm Kyuubi Uzumaki. Me and my kid
brother, Naruto, are the new transfer students here but he's not in
our grade. And following me today would be Deidara and his crew so
come in now!" he yelled and left the room. He came back pulling
Deidara through the door. Deidara was complaining about coming in
second. He stopped as soon as he fully got in the classroom and
everyone stared at him. "Hey,un." He said simply and left the
room. Kyuubi growled and ran after him. They both came back in
pushing Hidan, Kakuzu, Sasori, Pein, Tobi, Zetsu, Kisame, and Itachi.
"Here's the rest of them." Kyuubi finished.</P><P>Iruka looked in surprise at Kyuubi and then at the other teenagers
and then back to Kyuubi. "How'd you get them to come to class? I've
been trying to get just one of them to do that for months! And
somehow you managed to get them all in here in one day!" he
exclaimed.</P><P>"Kyuu-chan here, made us come by making a deal. I hated this
fucking class because it was fucking boring. He says if I listen your
damn class won't be boring. So I came to prove him fucking wrong!"
Hidan cursed.</P><P>Iruka fumed. "No cursing in my class Hidan!" he said.</P><P>Hidan's eyes went wide. "No fucking cursing! Well fuck this! If I
can't curse in here I don't want to fucking come!"</P><P>Iruka looked alarmed. "Wait no, fine. Just don't do it too much."
he said.</P><P>Hidan looked normal again. "Oh, okay then."</P><P>Iruka sighed. "Okay, Itachi, Hidan, Kakuzu, Pein, Deidara, Sasori,
Zetsu, Tobi, and Kisame. Go sit over there and just pick up wherever
you were before you stopped coming." he said and pointed in the end
of the class. The group nodded and disappeared and then reappeared in
the back of the class in there seats. "Kyuubi-kun, sit by
Deidara-kun." Iruka instructed. Kyuubi nodded, grateful that Iruka
didn't think he looked like a girl.</P><P>He walked over to Deidara who was sitting next to Sasori and an empty
seat. He sat in the empty seat and said, "So what are we suppose
to do?"</P><P>Deidara shrugged. "I dunno. This is a
Reading class so I guess you're suppose to read."</P><P>Kyuubi shrugged too and put his head on
his desk and looked around the room since he didn't have anything to
read.</P><P>He looked around the classroom and saw
his new friends each doing something different. Hidan was actually
listening to what Iruka-sensei was saying and he didn't look very
bored. Kakuzu was staring at the five dollar bill he had got from
Kyuubi and was almost drooling. Pein was reading a random book that
Kyuubi couldn't see the title of. Deidara was arguing with Sasori
about art. Zetsu was staring out of the window at trees and Tobi was
poking Zetsu with a pencil. Kisame was sleeping with his head on his
desk and Itachi...Itachi was staring at Kyuubi.</P><P>Kyuubi blushed at the attention he was
getting from the raven haired boy who was sitting right next to him.
"Wh-what is it, Itachi-san?" he asked nervously and then cursed
himself for stuttering again.</P><P>Itachi found this cute and smiled at
Kyuubi. "Nothing, you're just really cute. Pretty too."</P><P>Kyuubi's blush deepened at the
complement. "Th-thank you." he stuttered, getting use to
stuttering in front of Itachi.</P><P>Said boy continued to smile and stare
at Kyuubi. "You're welcome, Kyuu-chan."</P><P>Kyuubi, for some unknown reason, didn't
mind Itachi calling him 'Kyuu-chan'. Kyuubi smiled at Itachi. "Hey,
Itachi-san, Deidara-san said you have a brother named Sasuke. Right?"</P><P>Itachi nodded. Kyuubi continued, "Well,
I wanted to know how old Sasuke-san is. Then I'll know if he's in
Naru's class." he explained.</P><P>Itachi looked thoughtful. "He's 13."
Itachi said.</P><P>Kyuubi grinned brightly. "Awesome! He
is in Naru's class!" Kyuubi said excitedly. Then he clasped his
hand over his mouth, he had said that a little too loud.</P><P>Lucky for him, the rest of the class
didn't hear him.</P><P>Itachi laughed lightly at Kyuubi.
"Yeah, I guess he is. Hey Kyuu-chan, will you eat lunch with me and
my friends today?" he asked.</P><P>Kyuubi smiled at the offer and nodded.
"S-Sure, I'd love too." Kyuubi said.</P><P>"Good." Itachi said and then smiled
at Kyuubi warmly.</P><P>Kyuubi blushed prettily and looked away
from Itachi to hid his blush. Itachi laughed at that and then grabbed
some of Kyuubi's hair in his hands and started to fiddle with it.
Kyuubi smiled happily as Itachi played with his hair.</P><P>"Wh-what are you doing, Itachi-san?"
he asked.</P><P>"Playing with your hair, should I
stop?" he answered with another question.</P><P>Kyuubi smiled again. "No, don't."</P><P>Itachi nodded and continued to play
with Kyuubi's hair while Kyuubi closed his eyes and fell asleep
peacefully smiling with Itachi fiddling with his hair.</P><p align='center'>XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX</P><P>In this story, Zetsu
can't have green skin or a plant shell on his head so I took that
off as well as his face being two different colors.</P><P>Same thing with Kisame,
no blue skin.</P><P>Please R&R! This is my
first story like this so be nice! And sorry that Itachi was so OOC
but it was necessary for the story and he probably with stay like
that.</P><P>And tell me if I made Kyuubi
and Naruto act too girly. And please tell me what you think! I don't
care if you type one word it would still be highly appreciated!</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p align='center'>Ultimate
Ukes</P><P>By:
moonlightstar12</P><P>Warning
/ A/N: YAOI! And a lot of OOCness. Also Naruto and Kyuubi will be
placed in like a lot of different couples in this fic. In the
beginning Naruto will be paired with all of the rookie males and
Kyuubi will be paired with all of the Akatsuki but it won't stay that
way. So Naru x a lot of people and Kyuubi x a lot of people but most
importantly is that in the end it will be SasuNaru and ItaKyuu. And
there will also be more yaoi couples. And cross dressing too.</P><P>Summary:
Naruto and Kyuubi are the new students at Shinobi Academy for Boys.
What happens when they are considered 'inhumanly pretty and cute' by
most of the student body, especially two Uchihas?</P><p align='center'>XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX</P><P><I><U><B>With Kyuubi</B></U></I></P><P>He was awaken from his
peaceful slumber by the feeling of Itachi pulling lightly on his hair
and the sound of the bell ringing that signified that it was time for
they're next class.</P><P>"Hey Kyuu-chan, wake
up," he said softly as he continued to pull Kyuubi's long hair.
Kyuubi groaned sleepily, sat up, and looked at Itachi.</P><P>"What is it?" he
said, looking half asleep.</P><P>Itachi chuckled and
said, "You have to wake up. Its time to go to the next class."</P><P>"Yeah, un. Where's
your locker?" Deidara getting up and starting to head for the door.
The others got up and followed him.</P><P>"It's by my little
brother's locker. Somewhere on this damn map." Kyuubi cursed the
map to hell for being useless.</P><P>"Let me see," said
Sasori and he took the map from Kyuubi's hands. Shizune had circled
the place where they're lockers were. "I know where this is.
Follow me," he said and gave the map back to Kyuubi. Then he walked
off in a random direction. Kyuubi and the others followed him.</P><P><I><U><B>With Naruto</B></U></I></P><P><I><U>(Meanwhile)</U></I></P><P>A little while later
the school bell rang. Naruto, who had fallen asleep while listening
to Kurenai's math lesson, woke up when he felt a couple pairs of
eyes on him.</P><P>He groaned softly as
his eyes fluttered open and his sight adjusted to the light in the
room. Kiba and Neji were staring at him, Shikamaru was still asleep,
and Sasuke was looking out of the window he was sitting next to.
"What do you two want?" he asked sleepily.</P><P>Neji smiled and Kiba
grinned. "Why'd you have to wake up? You look adorable when you
sleep." The latter said.</P><P>Naruto blushed slightly
and then asked, "What's that sound?" as he heard the bell
ringing.</P><P>"It's the school
bell, idiot," Sasuke said.</P><P>Naruto huffed again and
said, "So it's time to change classes? I need to go to my
locker."</P><P>"Where is it?" Neji
asked.</P><P>"By Kyuu-nii's
locker. It's somewhere on this map." Naruto said while holding up
the map he had gotten. His and Kyuubi's lockers were circled.</P><P>Neji took the map from
Naruto and looked at the locker locations. "I know where this is.
Come with me," he said and walked out of the door, expecting the
others to follow him.</P><P>Kiba got up and waited
for Naruto who was busy poking Shikamaru awake with the pencil he had
earlier and Sasuke was standing up and about to leave with them.</P><P>"Quit poking me! I'm
up!" Shikamaru growled as Naruto poked him again. Naruto laughed
and said, "Sorry. But come on, we have to go to our next class."</P><P>Shikamaru got up while
grumbling "troublesome" and started off after Neji, who had
noticed he wasn't being followed and had waited at the end of the
hall for them to catch up with him.</P><P>The group walked down
many random hallways and corridors in search of the lockers.</P><P>A minute later they
stopped in a hallway near the end of the school. "We're here."
Neji said simply. They stopped in front of a small row of lockers.</P><P>Naruto walked up to the
locker and started to unlock the combination when Naruto heard a
familiar cry of "Naru!" Naruto turned from his locker to see his
brother coming towards him and followed by a large group of older
kids.</P><P>"Kyuu-nii!" Naruto
yelled in return as he hugged his brother around the stomach in
greeting. They separated and Kyuubi looked up from him to the four
other boys who were with him. "Who are they?" Kyuubi asked with
narrowed eyes. He didn't trust the long haired one and the one with
the triangles on his face. He didn't worry too much about the other
two since the one with his hair in a ponytail looked like he was
ready to drop to the floor and go to sleep and the raven haired one
looked a lot like Itachi so it must be his little brother.</P><P>Naruto smiled and
turned to the others. "These are my friends. Kiba, Neji, Shikamaru,
and Sasuke," he said while pointing at each boy as he said they're
names. Kiba and Neji looked weirdly between the two blond brothers
trying to figure out how they both look how they do, Shikamaru still
looked extremely bored and tired, and Sasuke was looking at his
brother.</P><P>Kyuubi nodded and said,
"Uh huh…These are my friends. Deidara, Hidan, Kakuzu, Sasori,
Pein, Tobi, Zetsu, Kisame, and Itachi," while pointing at them
while he said they're names. Deidara grinned at him and waved with
the mouth in his hand grinning too, Hidan smirked at him, Kakuzu
looked weirdly at him, Sasori smiled, Pein ignored them, Tobi greeted
him in his normal way, Zetsu tried to stop Tobi from getting to
energetic, Kisame grinned at him, revealing his shark teeth, and
Itachi was having a staring contest with Sasuke at the time.</P><P>Hidan walked up to
Naruto. Naruto looked up to look him in the face and Hidan looked
down. Hidan surveyed him by looking at him up and down, causing
Naruto to fidget and Kyuubi to get pissed. Hidan then smirked again
and turned to Kyuubi. "Hey Kyuu-chan! I knew I was right! Your
little bro is a uke too! He's not as pretty as you but he's just
as cute," Hidan started and laughed at Kyuubi who was fuming and
then turned back to Naruto, "Hey bitch," he said, addressing
Naruto.</P><P>Naruto looked in
disbelief and then he glared childishly. "I'm not a bitch!" he
yelled.</P><P>"Then your
Naru-chan." Hidan said, glad that he got the other brother to fall
for this as well.</P><P>"I'm not a girl
either!" Naruto yelled.</P><P>Just as Hidan was about
to go into his explanation again, Kyuubi smacked him away and went to
Naruto. "Naru just let him call you Naru-chan. He won't call you
anything other than that or bitch." Kyuubi explained.</P><P>Naruto silently fumed
at this but said, "Okay fine." Hidan grinned broadly but was a
little disappointed that he couldn't completely finish his trick.</P><P>Then Kakuzu came up and
asked, "Hey Naru-chan, do you have any money?"</P><P>Naruto nodded and took
out his wallet. He was going to give Kakuzu 20 dollars (Naruto is
much more generous than Kyuubi) when Kyuubi snatched it away from him
and glared heatedly at Kakuzu. The money lover glared back and tried
to take the wallet from Kyuubi. Kyuubi leaned back and stretched his
hand with the wallet in it as far back as he could which was just out
of reach for Kakuzu. Kakuzu continued to try and reach for it while
Kyuubi continued to hold it away from him.</P><P>Kyuubi lost his balance
after awhile and fell down on his back and Kakuzu, who was half way
holding himself up and half way letting Kyuubi hold him up, fell on
top of him. Kyuubi was on the bottom laying flat on his back, crushed
under Kakuzu's weight, and Kakuzu, who had tried to use his arms as
a cushion to keep from hurting himself and Kyuubi while falling,
ended up with his arms on either side of Kyuubi's head, his stomach
on top of Kyuubi's, and their legs sprawled on the floor.</P><P>Kyuubi went beet red
and Kakuzu just reached for the wallet that Kyuubi still had and
stole it from him. He jumped up triumphantly and then realized what
he did. He put the wallet in his pocket and reached down to help up a
still beet red Kyuubi who excepted the hand after a few seconds of
lying on the floor.</P><P>"Sorry." Kakuzu
apologized half-heartedly. He was counting the money in Naruto's
wallet, which happened to be a lot, not including the credit card.</P><P>Kyuubi and Naruto both
glared at him and he grinned. Then Itachi did it and he froze. For
some reason, Itachi had felt a pang of anger and some other feeling
he wasn't used to when Kakuzu had fallen on Kyuubi. The anger was
more apparent so he brushed off the other feeling with anger. "Give
it back Kakuzu." Itachi reprimanded harshly. Kakuzu flinched,
nodded, and then reluctantly gave the wallet back to Naruto. "Now
apologize to Kyuu-chan's little brother." Itachi ordered coldly,
his voice noticeably lightening up as he said 'Kyuu-chan'.</P><P>"Sorry Naru-chan."
Kakuzu apologized. All the others watched in amazement, especially
the older ones. They'd never seen Kakuzu give up money, ever. Even
a penny. But now he'd just given up a whole wallet with thousands
of dollars in it.</P><P>Naruto blinked in
genuine confusion but said, "Th-thanks, I guess…" and gave a
small, shy smile. A small, shy that caused Neji and Kiba to glomp
him. Naruto, under both of they're weights, and surprised at the
action that he fell too.</P><P>He hit the floor with
Neji and Kiba both hugging him on either side. Sensing that they both
had him, Neji and Kiba started a little tug-o'-war over him with
Naruto as the rope.</P><P>Kyuubi looked ready to
rip the two boys apart for doing that to his baby brother but
Deidara, Sasori, and Itachi held him back, wanting to see what would
happen. That and they didn't want to have to drag two half dead
bodies to the infirmary.</P><P>Naruto yelped as they
stood up, each took one of his arms and started pulling harder and
they started talking. "Hey! Let him go! He's mine!" Kiba yelled
as he pulled Naruto's left arm.</P><P>"No you let go! He's
mine!" Neji yelled in response and jerked Naruto towards him by the
right arm, earning him another yelp.</P><P>They continued the
pulling as they saw the other wouldn't let go, all the while
yelling "He's mine!" Shikamaru had somehow managed to fall
asleep standing up and Sasuke was watching them wide-eyed. He was
getting worried that they were hurting the boy by pulling on him so
hard. Then he started to get worried for himself. He never had
worried about anyone other than himself. But suddenly, he was
worrying about this boy that he had just met today. As Naruto yelped
again at a surprisingly strong jerk from Kiba, Sasuke decided to
worry about that later and just act out of instinct, which is what he
usually did.</P><P>Sasuke walked up to
Naruto, ignoring Kyuubi who was having to be held back now by Pein,
Kisame, and Zetsu as well as Deidara, Sasori, and Itachi, ignoring
everyone else's (minus Kiba, Shikamaru, Naruto, and Neji) surprised
looks. He gave a death glare to both Kiba and Neji that was so
intense that both boys immediately stopped pulling Naruto and let him
go. Then Sasuke walked up even closer to Naruto, who was confused as
to what just happened, and wrapped his arms protectively around
Naruto. He had no idea why, but that was what his instincts told him
to do. They were never wrong before so he wasn't going to start
doubting them now.</P><P>Kyuubi froze and
watched the scene wide-eyed. The ones holding him did so too.
Especially Itachi. In the whole 13 years Sasuke had been his little
brother he'd never seen Sasuke give any sign of affection to anyone
other then his big brother - -not that he still did - -, they're
dead mother, and their dead dad. Ever since they'd been killed he
stuck to himself a lot. So this was the last thing he expected Sasuke
to do.</P><P>Naruto's face lite up
to a bright pink color as Sasuke held him and gave Kiba and Neji
looks that said, 'If-you-touch-him-again-I'll-kill-you'. And
for some odd reason, he didn't feel the least bit uncomfortable. If
anything, he was in the most comfortable position he'd ever been
in. Why he felt that way, he didn't know. Naruto vowed to himself
to ask Kyuubi about it later.</P><P>After making clear to
Kiba and Neji not to play tug-o'-war with Naruto again, Sasuke let
him go and walked back to where he was before. He looked on passively
as if nothing ever happened while everyone just gaped at him. He
ignored everyone else and asked, "Hey usuratonkachi, aren't you
supposed to be getting your books?" to Naruto who was faintly
blushing and still staring at Sasuke nodded absentmindedly and went
to his locker and got out his books. Then he turned to his big
brother.</P><P>Kyuubi had a mixture or
relief, confusion, and anger on his face. Manly relief though. He
turned from Sasuke to his brother and asked, "Naru? Are you
okay?!?" His protective older brother skills were working over
time.</P><P>Naruto smiled happily.
"Yeah, I'm fine. They didn't hurt me that much. Please don't
get mad at them," he said, and by them, he meant Kiba and Neji who
were still looking shocked.</P><P>"You sure Naru?
'Cause if you're not and you're more hurt then what you're
saying I swear I'll personally come and kill those little bastards
you call friends," Kyuubi growled coldly as he glared heatedly at
the two still shocked brunettes. The only way to tell if they even
heard what Kyuubi said was by the way they had visibly cringed at
him.</P><P>"No! Kyuu-nii don't
do that! Don't you remember what happened la-" Kyuubi smacked his
hand on Naruto's mouth and glared fiercely at him, which was only
something he did when he was really mad.</P><P>"Don't say that in
public," he whispered just as fiercely as his glare.</P><P>Naruto nodded sadly and
then forced a happy smile back on his face. He hugged Kyuubi again
and said, "Bye Kyuu-nii! I'll see you after school!" and then
turned to his friends who had stopped gaping and were each doing
they're own thing. Neji and Kiba were arguing on who Naruto should
be mad at for hurting him more, Shikamaru was still asleep, and
Sasuke was…watching him. He had an 'I-need-to-talk-to-you' look
on his face. Naruto nodded slightly and Sasuke was satisfied.</P><P>Kyuubi turned from his
little brother to see all of his new friends, even Tobi, were staring
at him seriously. Itachi walked up to him and asked, "What was
that?", referring to Kyuubi's and Naruto's little scene.</P><P>Kyuubi fidgeted
nervously under Itachi's intense gaze. Knowing that they weren't
going to let him go without him telling them, he looked over his
shoulder at his little brother who was trying to get Kiba and Neji to
stop arguing. Kyuubi sighed dejectedly and said, "I'll tell you
later," and walked to his locker, got his books, and sent one last
look at Naruto, yelled "Later Naru!" and then walked off in the
direction they came from. He only partially remembered the way to get
back to class and he was hoping that the others would follow him so
they could show him where to go.</P><P>And just as he hoped,
Deidara came running down the hall towards him. Everybody else came
at a slower pace. "Hey Kyuu-chan, why'd you go?" Deidara asked.
That wasn't the question he wanted to ask but he say Kyuubi didn't
want to talk about it.</P><P>"Because I didn't
want to talk in front of my little brother. He'd get upset and I
don't want him to be sad anymore." Kyuubi explained.</P><P>"Oh. Well you don't
have to talk. We'd like it…well at least Itachi and I would like
it if you told us. I don't know about the rest of them." Deidara
said. Kyuubi smiled at Deidara. "Okay, I'll tell you later," he
said. Deidara grinned back in response.</P><P><I><U><B>With Naruto</B></U></I></P><P><I><U>(Meanwhile)</U></I></P><P>Naruto and his friends
walked off to they're next class. It turns out that they all have
the same classes. Shikamaru was walking next to Kiba who was sulking
for making Naruto so upset with him (or at least thinking he was),
Neji was in front of everyone leading the way, and Naruto was in the
middle of Sasuke and Kiba. Sasuke was constantly looking over at
Naruto, getting worried again, who was lost in thought. He thought
about hitting him to wake him up but he didn't want to hurt him so
he settled for just walking silence. After all, Naruto said he was
going to tell him what was wrong later, right?</P><p align='center'>XxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxX</P><P><B>A/N: Hey people!
Thanks for reading! And special thanks to </B>AnsemMesna,
SweetDevilzEyez, Alternative Angel, Strawberrychan1, uchiha–senna,
<B>and </B>nekosoulreaper <B>for reviewing my story! Ya'll are
awesome! </B></P><P><B>Okay, I have a bad
habit of asking my readers if I can change something in my story even
though it's </B><I><B>my </B></I><B>story. So I'll ask on here
too. Is it alright if I make Kyuubi and Naruto have a dark secret
that tells why they left the Sand Village? Please? Everyone will
still think that they're innocent and stuff and still go after them
but I wanted them to have a secret that they only tell the people
closest to them. </B></P><P><B>And they go to lunch
next chapter. I haven't forgot about that. I just needed this
chapter to introduce Possessive! Sasuke. Is it alright that I made
him like that? But it was kind of helping the story since Naruto
still wanted to know what 'jump you' meant. And with Sasuke being
possessive, he might interfere. </B></P><P><B>Anyway please tell
me how I'm doing! I don't think I'm very good at writing
stories so if it sucks please tell me. Or if it's good or needs
editing. Or something!</B></P><P><B>R&R </B></P>
