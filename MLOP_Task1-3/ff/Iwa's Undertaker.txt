village of Konoha supposedly the most peaceful and accepting village
in all the five elemental nations, but if the other nations had known
what this village was doing to a five year old boy they would be
surprised. A young boy is walking down the empty streets of Konoha.
He is five years old with blond hair and crystal blue eyes. As he
walked down the road you notice that the boy is extremely
malnourished. The blue shirt he wore hung loosely from his shoulders.
His normally spiky bright blond hair was a dull brown with dirt
showing that he hadn't washed his hair in a long time. His clothes
were covered in dried blood and dirt. The boy didn't even have
shoes. This boy was young Naruto Uzumaki the "Demon" of Konoha.
As he walked he though about what his life was like for the first
five years of his life.</p><P>"Why
does everybody hate me?" looked down sadly as some store owners
glared at him. "Why is it that my birthdays always end in me
getting beaten?" As young Naruto turned the corner he accidentally
bumped into a man. He looked up at the man and apologized. The man a
ninja sneered at Naruto. Naruto suddenly recognized the man he was
Hakate Kakashi student of the late yondaime Hokage Minato Namikaze.
He looked at the legendary shinobi with awe, but when Naruto was
distracted Kakashi punched Naruto in the mouth. " You demon I'm
going to finish what Minato-sensei started.". Naruto's eyes
widened in fear as Kakashi gathers chakra into his hand the chakra
soon turns into lightning as he charges Naruto. Kakashi yells,
"Chidori". Before he shoves his hand into Naruto's chest a
shadow ducks down and saves Naruto. Naruto looks at his savior it was
a man he looked to be around thirty years old. He had light blonde
hair and black eyes. He was dressed in light brown shinobi pants with
a light brown shirt. Over his shirt he wore a dark brown cloak with a
hood. He was wearing a shinobi utility belt and a kunai and shuriken
holster on his left thigh and bandages on his right thigh. He pointed
his palms at Kakashi and Naruto saw to open mouths with sharp little
teeth in the center of his palm. Kakashi sneered at the mysterious
shinobi, "Why are you defending the demon?" The shinobi sneered
back at Kakashi "the only demon I see here is you yeah." As
Kakashi charged at the ninja. He failed to notice the clay the
shinobi put in the mouths. As he reached the shinobi he struck him in
the chest," Chidori." When he hit the man in the chest he
sneered, "That is what you get when you defend the demon from the
great copy ninja Kakashi." His sneer fell when the man turned to
mud, he looked around then he heard, "That's it is that all the
great copy ninja Kakashi can do yeah." The shinobi smirked," see
you in hell yeah." He pointed his palms at Kakashi and shot a
spider at him, the spider latched on to Kakashi and he tried a
substitution but he found he couldn't do jutsu. The shinobi smirked
and said," boom." After he said this he grabbed Naruto and jumped
over the village wall. When the two cleared the wall they heard a
loud explosion. The mystery ninja held on to Naruto and started to
run to the border.</p><P>Twenty
minutes after the two left the village The Sandaime Hokage, Ryu
Sarutobi and twenty anbu arrived at the scene. Two of the anbu
identified the body as one captain Kakashi Hakate. The Sandaime
pronounced the anbu captain dead at the scene. "Hokage- sama."
An anbu ran up to the old hokage. "We found a note by the crater.
He handed it to the Sandaime. Sarutobi read the note.</p><P><I>Dear
Hokage,</I></p><P><I>I
have taken young Naruto with me yeah. I have watched what this
pitiful excuse for a village has done to him. I have seen the
beatings and the glares and to be honest it makes me sick yeah. I
promised his father that if he had a son I would watch after him and
when he is old enough he will marry my sister kushina yeah. I will
support him in what ever he does if it is destroying this pathetic
village then so be it yeah. Sarutobi I saw that you tried your best
to help him but it just didn't work yeah. I know you don't want
me to but I'm going to tell Naruto about his parents and the kyubbi
yeah. I will also help him awaken his bloodline yeah. He will be
staying with my clan so any hunter-nin or Konoha Nin that try to kill
him will be killed and sent back in a box yeah.</I></p><P><I>Signed
Deidara Dei</I></p><P>Sarutobi
bowed his head in shame minato was right about what the village would
do he said in his head, " Naruto please forgive me.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Iwa's Undertaker</p><P>Chapter 2 negotiations and secrets.</p><P>On the Iwa/Konoha
border</p><P>In
a small clearing sat a small boy sitting on a log watching a mystery
ninja start a fire. The man feeling the boys eyes on him turned
around and smiled. The boy seeing the man's smile smiled back, but
then he remembered the question he was going to ask the man," Hey
mister who are you?" The man looked at Naruto for a second then
nodded. "My name is Deidara of the Dei clan." Naruto gave the man
a funny look. "The dei clan I know all the clans from Konoha and
the Dei clan is not one of them." Deidara nodded, "who said the
Dei clan was from Konoha?" Naruto's eyes widened," If they
aren't from Konoha then where are they from?" Deidara gave Naruto
a serious look. "My clan and I are from Iwagakure no Sato in the
land of earth, I came to Konoha to find the son of my only friend
from Konoha, and I found him yeah." Naruto's eyes widened even
more, "you know who my parents were?" Deidara nodded. Naruto's
eyes became misty, "Who were they?" Deidara looked into Naruto's
eyes and asked a simple question, "Do you really want to know?"
Naruto nodded. Deidara nodded and sat down on the log next to Naruto.
"Naruto I'm going to tell you everything those bastards in Konoha
never told you." Naruto was shaking with anticipation. "Naruto
your father was a great man I don't want you thinking any less of
him when you hear the whole story ok?" Naruto nods "Naruto your
father was Minato Namikaze and your mother was Kushina Uzumaki."
Naruto asked," where have I heard those names before?" Deidara
nodded, " it's possible you've never heard of their real names
but you might have heard of the yellow flash, Or the scarlet fang."
Naruto almost pasted out it's not every day when you hear your
parents were the yondaime hokage and konoha's most famous anbu.
"Now I'm going to tell you why that hellhole of a village hated
you." Naruto was shocked here he was with a complete stranger about
to find out why he was hated but when he asked the old man he said he
wouldn't tell him until he though he was ready. "Tell me Naruto
what do you know about the Kyubbi?" Naruto scratched his head, "I
don't know much but I do know the yondaime or my father I guess
sacrificed his life to kill it." Deidara nodded he though as much.
"That story is half right your father sacrificed his life to seal
it not kill it." Naruto was shocked they sealed it "why would the
old man lie to us." Deidara saw Naruto deep in though," Naruto
your father sealed the demon into a newborn baby now do you know
anybody born on October tenth?" Naruto thought for a minute before
a look of horror came to his face. "He sealed it in me how could he
I was his own son." Deidara shook his head. "Why would he force
this burden on another family when he couldn't give it to his own?"
A look of understanding flashed in Naruto's eyes. Deidara smiled.
"Ok Naruto we've rested enough now we need to get to my village
so we can get you ready to be a shinobi." Naruto gave him a said
look," but what if everyone in your village hates me?" Deidara
gave him a reassuring smile, "Naruto our kage is the kindest woman
in all of the elemental nations I'm sure she would accept you with
open arms." With that Deidara grabbed Naruto and started their
fifty mile run to Iwa.</p><P>Konoha
council room</p><P>In
the center of the great room stood: all the clan heads, the Hokage
and his aides and Jiraya of the sannin. These were the most powerful
men and women in the whole village. Sarutobi cleared his throats. All
the council looked up. "First roll." The council paid attention.
"Shibi Aburame." Shibi nodded. "Tsume Inuzuka "a bark was
heard with a here. "Choza akimichi", the sound of chewing was
their answer. "Hiashi Hyuga" Present was his cold response.
"Shikaku Nara" a yawn was his answer. "Fugaku Uchiha" a here
was heard. "Koharu and himura" here was heard. "And finally
Danzou" a final here was heard. Sarutobi looked up at the people in
front of him. "Why have we been summoned Hokage-sama?" Sarutobi
looked up at Hiashi. "You have been called because Kakashi Hakate
is dead and Naruto Uzumaki has been kidnapped." The council was in
an uproar about the death of one of their best shinobi, but when a
few heard about Naruto they smiled it was Kasha Haruno who voiced a
fews opinion, "finally the demon is gone he-. Before she could
finish she fell dead with a kunai in the throat. All looked on
shocked to find it was Jiraya that threw the kunai. "I hear another
person call him a demon and we will be down a few assholes." The
glare he gave was enough to silence the whole council. "Now Jiraya
do you know who kidnapped Naruto." Jiraya nodded with a grim face.
"It was a shinobi from Iwa." Danzou shouted,"How could you let
this happen if you would have given the demon to me it could have
been a weapon for this village not for our enemy." The council
gasped as another kunai found its way to Danzou's forehead. The
councilman fell down dead. "That's two". Inochi stood and
said," Maybe we should ask the Tsuchikage if she would send Naruto
back to us." The rest of the council nodded. Sarutobi shook his
head, "she wouldn't send him back." The council looked at him
confused," why?" Sarutobi sighs," I'll tell you but it can't
leave this room Naruto-</p><P>Cliffhanger</p><P>The
story is officially Temari/ oc/oc/Naruto</p><P>Now
which summon do you want Naruto to have</p><P>Dogs</p><P>Tigers</p><P>Crows</p><P>Or

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Iwa's undertaker</p><P>Chapter 3</p><P>A blonde haired boy and his blonde escort were walking down a road in
earth country. The boy looks at his new friend and asks a question.
"Hey Deidara nii-san." Deidara looks over at the young blonde,
"yes otuto." Naruto locked eyes with Deidara and asked, "Are
you going to train me on the way to iwa?" Deidara was going to
refuse when Naruto used the most fearsome known to adults that have
to deal with children the <B>puppy-eyes no jutsu</B>. Deidara though
'must resist.' With a sigh he said,"Ok Naruto I'm going to
train you but no jutsu at least not yet." Naruto was jumping up and
down shouting, "TRAINING WOOOO!" Deidara could only chuckle while
looking at the cute little idiot. "Ok Naruto to start you're
shinobi training, here's the schedule I was going to give you in
about a month." Naruto took the paper when he saw all he had to
learn he nearly had a heart attack.</p><P>4:00 am wake up and breakfast</p><P>4:30 am light warm up</p><P>6:00 am studying history, shinobi conduct, anatomy, basic taijutsu,
ninjutsu, and genjutsu</p><P>12:00 pm light sparring</p><P>3:00 pm heavy exercise</p><P>5:00 pm small break</p><P>5:15 pm jutsu training</p><P>8:00 pm stealth training</p><P>9:00 sleep</p><P>Deidara saw the look on Naruto's face and let out a small chuckle,
"What you didn't think becoming the world greatest shinobi would
be easy did you?" Naruto got serious within a second which
unnerved Deidara slightly. "No I didn't now nii-san can we get
started?" Deidara nodded. Then Deidara remembered something," hey
otuto come here." Naruto ran over to Deidara. Deidara gave Naruto a
medium sized box, "here these will help in your training." Naruto
opened the box to find a pair of arm bracers and shin guards. "Wow
what are these." Deidara smiled, "these boy are chakra weights
but they aren't just any chakra weights these are the chakra
weights of the Nidaime hokage." Naruto gasped these were the
weights of one of the founders of the mighty leaf village. "How did
you get these I thought everything of the shodaime's and Nidaime's
were sealed in a scroll in the hokage tower?" Deidara smirked, "I
thought you might need them so I took the scroll for the Nidaime's
and the Shodaime's belongings since that hellhole sure as hell
doesn't deserve them, and when you finish your training and become
a gennin I will give you the armor of the Nidaime along with a
special weapon from my clan." Naruto stared at Deidara with wide
eyes before he tackled Deidara with a hug. Naruto started to cry on
Deidara's shoulder thanking him. Deidara smiled and let the young
boy cry himself to sleep, "Have a good night's rest Otuto because
you'll need it for tomorrow's training." With that he laid a
sleeping Naruto on his sleeping bag and climbed into his own bag
where sleep consumed him.</p><P>In side Naruto's mindscape.</p><P>Naruto woke up in a damp smelly sewer. Naruto looked around, and got
up. He walked around lost until he heard a low growl. Naruto followed
the noise. He followed it around the dark sewer until he came to a
giant room with a cage in the middle. The door to the cage was shut
with a strip of paper that had seal on it. Then out of the darkness
Naruto saw two giant red eyes with slitted pupils and a huge grin
with long sharp white teeth. Naruto was shaking, "Who are you?" 
The big eyes looked down at him in sadness. <B>"My Name is Yana or
you may know me as the Kyubbi no Kitsune."</B> Naruto stared at the
cage in awe with a hint of confusion. This was the reason the village
hated him, he should have hated it shouldn't he. Then he thought
about it kyubbi wasn't the one that made his life a living hell it
was the arrogant bigots in the village that did that. He looked up at
the giant fox and saw tears falling from its eyes. Naruto did
something the Kyubbi never excepted he walked into its cage and
hugged its giant paw. "I don't hate you." The Kyubbi looked
shocked here she was getting hugged by the boy whose life she made a
living hell and he said he didn't hate her. Naruto gave her a big
smile and hugged her paw harder. The kyubbi smiled at the boy and
said, "thank you". Then the kyubbi though of something.
<B>"Naruto-kun I have something I wish to give you."</B> Naruto
looked up at the big fox with a curious look, "what is it
Yana-Chan?" She smiled he cared for her. All of a sudden there was
a blinding flash of light standing where the Kyubbi once was a girl
about his age. She had long silver hair with slightly pointed ears
and light green eyes. She was about 4'5" a perfect hourglass
figure with smooth white skin. Her finger nails were sharp and
pointed like claws, and behind her are nine silver tails. Naruto was
shocked here was the queen of demons, but she didn't look like the
evil monster he was told she was. No she looked like a normal girl
just with tails. As soon as he noticed she was naked he blushed so
red it could make a tomato jealous. Kyubbi looked at Naruto notice
his blush, then it hit her she was naked. With a snap of her fingers
a beautiful silver kimono with little foxes on it appeared. She
quickly dressed and looked at Naruto. "Now Naru-kun I have four
gifts for you." Naruto was looking at her with a big fox-like smile
that made Yana blush. "The first is three summoning contracts. The
first is raccoons, watch out for the boss summon if he doesn't like
you he will steal everything of value you have." Naruto looked like
a fish out of water. "Next is the celestial bull contract, finally
you will receive the greatest contract in all the world, this
contract is the contract with kami's personal summons the celestial
tigers." By this point Naruto is nearly hyperventilating. Kyubbi
just gave him a paper bag and continued, "Next you will receive a
dojutsu it is like the sharingan except it has five levels and you
can use the Tsukuyomi once you activate it." Naruto had calmed down
and was listening carefully. "Next I will turn you into a demon and
I will become your mate." Naruto blushed and nodded. Kyubbi smiled
at him warmly," you just have to channel a little bit of chakra and
bite me at the base of my neck." She pulled down the one side of
her kimono just above her breast. Naruto channeled chakra into his
canines and bit Yana on the neck. Next Yana channeled a little bit of
chakra into her canines and bit Naruto on the shoulder. Where they
bit each other a small seal of a fox paw appeared. Yana gave Naruto a
passionate kiss as he sprouted nine blonde fox tails. Naruto then
asked Yana a serious question. "Can you leave my mind?" Yana
nodded," how?" Naruto asked. She pointed towards the seal and
said "pull the seal off and I can be in the real world with you."
Naruto nodded and pulled of the seal. He kissed her and said, "See
you outside Yana-hime."</p><P>Cliffhanger</p>
