Please be nice-ish yet honest with your reviews and what you think. I have been questioning my writing ability for some time so I need non-family input! Any who this is a fem-kyuu and Naruto fluff, and don't worry No romance until Naruto is older! Kyuubi "accepted" her immortality at 16 and will make immortal at 16 as well. </b></p><p><b>Kyuubi has the ability to leave Naruto but no-one knows it. This story hit me and I just thought that it could really work! But a lot of credit to a certain artist that I do not know who it is or the pieces name but stop me if a part of this seems familiar. Kyuubi shows Naruto some affection at a young age but only to get him more comfortable for the future so he is not overwhelmed. Until that age Kyuubi has taken it upon herself to make Naruto her kit/adoptive son. Well…enjoy!</b></p><p>"speech"</p><p><i>Thoughts</i></p><p>"<b>Demonic voice"</b></p><p>"<b>Mother's" love chapter1: adoption</b></p><p>"But why?"</p><p>"Because, you're a filthy demon brat and you must be treated as such!"</p><p>"I don't understand why I…" Poor five year old Naruto Uzumaki was then pushed of of the steps leading up to his orphanage. He couldn't understand why this was happening to him. He was given a damp half flooded portion of the places basement, was left unfed several nights so that he couldn't be as happy as an orphan could be he only (barely) survived, and now he was being kicked out completely… on his birthday! Now he was left to fend for himself against the drunken gennin and civilians of Konoha village hidden in the leaves, but for Naruto it was more like hell, hidden in the lies. However little to his knowledge, a cloaked woman was standing off to the side, considering how to approach when…</p><p>"well lookie here! It's the demon, lets skin 'im and sell 'is carcass to the highest bidder!" The woman grimaced as she heard this and was finally ready to intervene. But was too late as a rip could be heard as Naruto fell laughter ensued.</p><p>As Naruto's eyesight blurred he saw a woman step out of an alleyway in between them and himself. A he blinked he heard an earsplitting cry and when he opened them back up he saw her running up to him, and the corpses of each and every one of his attackers. When she lifted him into her arms bridal style she whispered one final sentence.</p><p>"your suffering, is now over." After he knew that he was safe and in this woman's care he let the blackness…overtake him.</p><p>(A/N: here is where the affection seed is planted deep within him, but she will not have any romantic relations with him until later</p><p>P.S. if you had a perverted thought about that you need a complete reality check!)</p><p>Naruto awoke in a warm, soft bed in a pair of comforting arms pressed against something even softer than the bed. He couldn't help but let a loud groan escape his lips as he felt a huge pain in his shoulder. Kyuubi heard this and spoke up.</p><p>"Morning! How are you feeling?" Kyuubi suddenly regreted asking as she recalled the events of last night.</p><p>"I'm in a lot of pain what happened…last…night wait! Who are you and where am I, are you going to hurt me I…I"</p><p>"Relax! I can answer all of your questions after we get you something to eat, here, follow me we can discuss on the way!"</p><p>"Alright I guess…" <i>what's with the enthusiasm…well great! I'm about to die aren't I?</i></p><p>Kyuubi then proceeded to help Naruto to his feet and walk him to the nearest door. As she opened it Naruto was astonished by the beauty of the mansion. He looked to the girl for confermation and was even more shocked to notice two things about his heroine. One would be the beauty of the girl herself which rivaled the home that she resides in. (A/N: Naruto isn't thinking about her like that, he is just noticing this.) She had rather pale skin which seemed perfect for her crimson hair and eyes. Her hair went down to her calves and covered one eye (A/N Again! Sorry: think Cynthia's hair from pokemon) she had as many curves as a racetrack and perfect D-cup breasts that were covered, like the rest of her body with a beautiful kimono with fox patterns. The top was red with foxes and one giant nine tailed fox, then the fire slowly transitioned into a wonderful pink at the bottom. She noticed his gaping mouth and smirked.</p><p>"Are you okay?"</p><p>At this Naruto came out of his trance and blushed.</p><p>"I-I uhh…yea it's j-just I-I-I…umm…" Naruto could only frown at his actions as now she might not be so nice anymore.</p><p>Seeing him struggle, she spoke up. "It's fine! I was just teasing!"</p><p>Naruto had to sigh as relief flowed over him as his first possible friend might not be lost.</p><p>"come on let's go!"</p><p>"alright sooo… who are you?" Naruto couldn't help but ask. She couldn't help but sigh and got lost in her own thoughts when she finally came up with an answer.</p><p>"My name is Kyuubi but any other information I think would be for another day besides the fact that I am a friend who would like to adopt you and raise you here! Also, don't worry about the village! I won't take no for an answer!"</p><p>Naruto gasped and tried to scream out in joy but settled for a nod. Kyuubi squeeled and led him off into the hallway. Not knowing what to do only had kyuubi interrupt his fearful thoughts.</p><p>"Let's get you settled in shall we!"</p><p><b>I'm back! So how did you like so far? Going to continue after I feel that this story is appreciated enough so please review, fav, pm me anything to let me know I'm not a failure! Until next time c ya!</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>Sorry for not updating but you guys wouldn't understand how difficult this is to find time in my life! Teachers hate me, people nag me, etc. And don't get me started on the crap I'm gonna get for this!</B></P><P><B>For Elfen Lied and Rosario+Vampire fans! I had an idea for a crossover after this where Tskune would get a huge pain and blood coming out of two points on his head. When it ends he has the strange ability to use "vectors!" Then he takes on the biggest, most terrifying monsters in the academy! But why is Alucard suddenly so interested in him? Increasingly so with every monster defeated! </B></P><P><B>So for all of you familiar with these then tell me! Oh and if it's Moka and Tskune like I'm planning then will it show up in the normal areas of the site?</B></P><P><B>Welcome to the next instalment of Mother's love (Non-incest)! Thanks to those who reviewed and sorry for the short 1</B><B>st</B><B> chapter! I hadn't known that it takes so thanks for those who support my first story but some reviews and comments would be nice (hint hint) anyway…here we go!</B></P><P>"speech"</P><P><I>Thoughts</I></P><P>Oh Crap, I forgot the Disclaimer for chapter 1! I don't own it! If I did then why would this be on ! I mean really why do we need the disclaimer when these stories would be on your computer and TV if they did own it! Think about it!</P><P><B>Fem kyuu + Naruto</B></P><P><U>"<B>Mother's" Love chapter 2:</B></U></P><P><I><U><B>TIME SKIP-NARUTO AGE 12</B></U></I></P><P>Naruto and Kyuubi were found sharing a bed in their home since his age of 5. Naruto was unaffected by this, even with his hormones raging. The metaphorical seed that Kyuubi needed to plant in his mind for their future to be complete has already been placed all that it needs is the perfect amount of nurturing.</P><P>"Die!"</P><P>"Why are you throwing kunais(spelling fail! Or not?) at sake bottles?"</P><P>"Because I'm bored!"</P><P>"Well let's go beat up the demon brat! I have been gone for so long on that mission in Suna! For fun there we tried beating up a demon there named Gaara!"</P><P>"How'd that go?"</P><P>"There were no survivors…"</P><P>"Wait then how are you here?"</P><P>"I'm just in your mind! You have officially went crazy with boredom"</P><P>"Well at least I have heaven to look forward to!"</P><P>*snicker* " Yea haa..I'll…I'll see you down here friend!"</P><P>"NOOOOO! Well might as well since I'm already screwed! Where's your wife?"</P><P>Kyuubi felt something squirming around on her arms and slowly opened her eyes to find out who would dare interrupt her sleep. She smiled when she saw who interrupted her was a young Naruto, just waking up.</P><P>"Gooood moooorniinnnggg Naruto-san!"</P><P>"mhh…w…what umm *yawn*…day is it?"</P><P>"It's the fifth of (insert random ninja month here since they have no contact with our world)."</P><P>*gasp* "Today is the day you finally teach me to use REAL jutsus not just that ninja stuff! It's also the day that you tell me the other type since I still have no idea!"</P><P>Naruto, under the Kyuubi's tutelage, Naruto mastered all techniques that he would have without by a later age, and now it was time for the demon training that Naruto had no idea about. He was also unaware of the fact that his friend and adoptive mother of so many years was the Kyuubi No Kitsune herself! To begin the process she had to donate two tails to the boy to make him a kit, this was a very painful experience for the young blonde which Kyuubi cleverly covered up with a made up chakra disease that she cured cause she was amazingly awesome to lead him off of the tail trail. (A/N: Think of the time where your mom told you that your bunny waffles ran away to go to that carrot and peanut butter farm out in faraway ville and your dad snickered…remember that even though it was a lie! Yea…I know you're sad but what is sad is the fact that I just helped you figure it out you gullible piece of… But I digress! And right here was where I remembered the disclaimer at the top!) Now was the time to tell him the whole story.</P><P>"So Naruto before you learn you of these techniques, you must learn why you can even use them."</P><P>"WHY! HUUUURRRYYYY III"MMM FREEAAAKIIINNNGGGGG OOOUUUTTT!"</P><P>"Ummm…? Can you please calm down?"</P><P>"IIIFFFF YYOOUUU SSSLLLLAAPPP MMMMEEEEEE RRRREEEEAAAALLLLYYYYY HHHAAARRRDDD!"</P><P>And so she did he flew across the room and fell into a deep sleep. Suddenly an explosion erupted from the middle of the room and a large, cloaked figure with a scythe emerged. Kyuubi let her nine tails flow free, threatening the figure that stood between her and her kit. The figure laughed at her sudden tensing of the Kyuubi. What the fox demon wasn't aware of was that a finally calm Naruto had awoken by the time this figure was awake, and his "mother" sprouting all of her nine tails. This shook Naruto to his very core as he witnessed this but that feeling soon went away as the man pointed his scythe at him and stated in his deep raspy voice.</P><P><U>"<I><B>You know not of who she is or what has happened to you because of this woman, now sleep. LEAVE THIS WORLD BEHIND!"</B></U></I></P><P>Naruto and Kyuubi alike were reduced to tears at this as Naruto vanished and appeared in the orb on the end of his scythe.</P><P><U>"<I><B>I am the Death God (Shinigami- don't know the language well enough and won't pretend so sorry!)and I am here for you and the boy alike!"</B></U></I></P><P>"But it's not our time! Not yet it's too soon!"</P><P><U>"<I><B>I know, I'm not here for that. Naruto's father has had to spend all of eternity with me and he gets whiny! Not that he is like that but when you spend this many years in a white room you get kinda bored! But I digress, now is not the time for my problems, now is the time to decide your fate with the boy. Due to the numerous drumming contests and thousands of bets lost, I owe this to him. He wanted you to mold the future that you have together so your romance would be perfect so what will it be? What is your perfect romance?</B></U></I></P><P>"I know! I choose…"</P><P><B>PM me or review your choices and my top 5 choices will go up on my profile to be decided by you so what are you waiting for! Tell me! And see ya next time!</B></P>
