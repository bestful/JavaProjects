Minato x Kushina, Naruto, Kyuubi<BR>Rating: PG-13<BR>Notes: I would
like to apologize, BECAUSE I FAIL AT LIFE AND UPDATING SHIT. I really
didn't like the way I wrote this, so I edited it like I was going
to die soon. Again, I cannot apologize enough to all of the people
that actually cared about this fic :/ I also come bearing evil
tidings… I kinda…. Got over Naruto. I really don't care
anymore. But this WILL be finished.<BR></B><BR>Disclaimer:
Naruto and its characters don't belong to me. I gain no profit with
this fiction.</P><P>The
annoying buzz of the alarm clock rang in his ears as the blond haired
man sat up sleepily. He rubbed his eyes and turned to the menace that
was his clock. He glared at the box that mocked him and stated 6:15.
He turned it off angrily with a slap to the button.</P><P>"Are
you up, Minato-koi?" (1) The voice came from his right. His wife,
Kushina, stood over the bed, buttoning her blue uniform shirt. On the
right sleeve was a red and white fan (2) and under in bold were the
words <I>Uchiha
Police Force, Osaka.</I>
Her long crimson hair was tied in a ponytail. She smirked, amused at
her husband's antics.</P><P>"Hurry
up, Minato-koi. I'm almost finished and you're not even out of
bed yet," she stated, tossing his uniform onto his awaiting lap.
Kushina turned, putting her belt on as Minato stood, wrapping his
arms around her waist. He lovingly kissed the shell of her ear.</P><P>"Good
morning to you, too." He said, seeming to be having fun when his
wife leaned into his embrace. Kushina rolled her eyes and broke his
hold easily to finish putting her belt on.</P><P>"Did
you wake the kids, Kushina-chan?" he asked. He knew how long it
took to get those two out of bed.</P><P>"Yup,
last I checked, they were in the kitchen eating breakfast. They're
in their in their pajamas, but at least they're up!" She smiled
brightly and seemed very proud of herself.</P><P>Kushina
left the room to get to the bathroom before it was unavailable, where
she took a shower and brushed her teeth and hair. By the time Minato
got to the bathroom, she was already brushing her wet hair. Minato
lazily brushed his teeth and combed his unruly, blond hair. Kushina
left the bathroom after putting her make-up on to get a bagel and,
about five minutes later, Minato left as well.</P><P>As
he entered the kitchen, he was knocked down by an orange and white
blur. He grunted as he hit the ground hard. Minato lifted his head to
a small boy the age of six with shaggy blond hair and cerulean blue
eyes.</P><P>"Ohaiyo,
Otousan!" (3) The blue eyes sparkled down at him. The smaller blond
had orange cargo pants and a white shirt with a red swirl on it.</P><P>"Naruto,
get off Otousan," chuckled Kushina. She sat at the table, newspaper
in her hands. She chewed on the bagel in her mouth absentmindedly.</P><P>Naruto
wouldn't budge, so Minato looked pleadingly at Kushina. She rolled
her eyes and averted them back to the paper. He sighed, giving up.</P><P>"Okay,
Naruto-"</P><P>"Now,
Kyuu-nii!" (4) Naruto called. Another small boy came out of his
hiding place behind a rather large flower pot and tackled his
otousan. The boy had his mothers red hair which was shoulder length
and was eight years old. His eyes were unusual. He didn't have his
fathers blue eyes or his mothers green eyes. He had a strange, bloody
crimson with a tint of yellow at the center.</P><P>"Kyuubi!
Naruto!" Minato yelped in surprise. The two giggling boys attacked
their father as he called out, "I need back up", Kushina ignoring
them all the while.</P><P>They
continued to wrestle until Kushina stepped in and stopped them before
it got out of hand. The red head and the blonde pouted.</P><P>"Okaasan!"
(5) Naruto and Kyuubi whined. "We were having fun!"</P><P>"I
could see that, but your otousan and I have to go to work!" she
scolded, shooting a glance to Minato. He looked away. The two stuck
out their bottom lips, pouting. Kushina left to sit on the couch.<p>Minato smiled warmly at the two and whispered, "When we get
home, I'll get you," he directed these words to Kyuubi. "That
giant chocolate bar you saw at 7-11 the other day." Kyuubi's eyes
lit up at the thought of chocolate. Minato looked at Naruto, who was
looking hopeful and said, "And I'll fix ramen for dinner."</P><P>Both
kids looked extremely excited at the thought of their favorite foods.
But Kyuubi looked skeptically at his otousan. "Promise?"</P><P>"I
promise," was their reply.</P><P>"Yay!"
the blond and red head hopped off of their otousan and jumped for
joy.</P><P>Minato
stood, dusting himself off. He took his and Kushinas shotguns from a
securely locked case a tossed Kushina's to her. She caught it with
ease and put it in her holster. Minato did the same and mouthed
something to her, smirking. The unsuspecting children squeaked when
their parents scooped them up in their arms, carrying them to the car
outside.<p>Kushina carried Naruto and Minato carried Kyuubi.
The couple carried their kids bridal style outside with the blond
struggling and the red head just sitting, not amused. They were set
in the back seat, kissed tenderly on the forehead, and then buckled
in.</P><P>Minato
sat in the front and Kushina sat to his left in the passenger's
seat. (6) As they drove, Naruto turned to his brother.</P><P>"Nee,
nee, niisan!" he whispered.</P><P>"Hm?"</P><P>"I
can't wait 'til Otousan comes home!" Naruto grinned widely.
Kyuubi nodded, thinking of the chocolate he would get that afternoon.</P><P>The
brothers were pulled from their fantasies when Kushina called their
names.</P><P>"Are
you listening?" she asked with concern. When the two had nodded she
seemed satisfied. "Now remember, when Iruka-sensei comes to pick
you up from the station, Naruto, ask him the whereabouts of your
jacket, 'kay?" A nod from Naruto and a "yes" from Kyuubi told
her that they understood. Naruto had left his jacket in his
God-Father's car the day before.</P><P>The
drive lasted about ten minutes until they pulled up to a large
building with rows of black and white police cars. Minato found a
parking spot and the four of them got out of the car. A sign on the
wall indicated that it was the <I>Uchiha
Police force, Oosaka</I>.
When they stepped inside, a few passerbys clad in the same outfit as
the Uzumakis greeted them and one gave Kyuubi and Naruto lollypops.
As they reached a room in the back, the couple rounded on the kids.</P><P>"Now,
you know that Otousan and Okaasan loves you." Kushina kissed them
lightly on the forehead. "Be good at school and treat Iruka-sensei
nice when he picks you two up." She directed her last words mostly
at Naruto who grinned mischievously.</P><P>"Bye,
Okaasan."</P><P>"Bye,
Otousan."</P><P>The
two police officers left and Naruto and Kyuubi walked into the room.
The room was a playroom for the officers' kids that had school
later but the parents had to go to work early and couldn't leave
them by themselves.</P><P>As
they busied themselves, Naruto played with the tinker toys and Kyuubi
sat on a beanbag reading <I>Where's
Waldo? </I>and
looking very angrily at the pages,
a man walked into the room. The man had a scar across his nose and
his brunette hair was up in a ponytail.</P><P>"Kyuubi!
Naruto!" He called. "It's time to go."</P><P>"Iruka-sensei!"</P><P>The
two pounced on the poor sensei, hanging onto his pants. Iruka sighed
as if this happened everyday. As a matter of fact, it did. He
proceeded to drag his legs out the door. The giggling duo were
surprisingly heavy.</P><P>Once
he managed to unlatch the tiny hellions from his legs, they bounced
to his car. As Iruka drove, Kyuubi nudged Naruto's side. Naruto
turned to his brother and hissed, "what?" Kyuubi threw a glance
to the driver and Naruto remembered.</P><P>"Hey,
ano(7), Iruka-sensei?" Naruto asked.</P><P>"Yes,
Naruto?"</P><P>"Do
you know where my jacket is? I forgot it yesterday."</P><P>"Oh,
yes!" Iruka exclaimed. "I had forgotten." He reached into the
front seat next to him. "You left it in my car yesterday." Iruka
handed Naruto an orange and blue jacket that looked five sizes too
big.</P><P>The
rest of the drive was almost quiet. Naruto kept reaching over the
seat to poke an annoyed Iruka in the head while Kyuubi stared blankly
out the window, counting telephone poles due to boredom.</P><P>When
Iruka pulled up to the curb to let them out, they were in front of a
building. There was a large sign that read, "<I>Nagoya
Elementary</I>"
at the front. He walked and signed them in, told them to behave, then
left for the high school he worked at.<p>Kyuubi walked his
little brother to his kindergarten class before walking to his first
grade class, waving good-bye to the younger. Their day was perfectly
fine, until a lady from the office knocked on Naruto's classroom
door.<p>"Ah…" Naruto's teacher had been reading them a
story, <I>Where
the Wild Things Are</I>,
and she set the book down before opening the door for the lady. The
two exchanged words before Naruto's teacher turned to him.<p>"Ano…"
She looked far from happy, which rang alarm bells in the small,
blond's head.<p>"You're wanted in the office, Dearheart,"
Kurenai-sensei smiled kindly to the frowning kindergartener.<p>Naruto
walked down the hallway, holding the office-lady's hand, neither of
them speaking. About halfway down the hall, Naruto noticed the
familiar, unique trait of red hair.<p>"Kyuu-nii!" Naruto
called to his nii-chan, letting go of his chaperone's hand. He ran
to his brother and the office-lady smiled kindly before continuing to
walk to office without Naruto. Kyuubi knew how to get to the
office.<p>"Are you going to the office, too?" Naruto
asked.<p>Kyuubi just nodded, frowning.</P><P>They
walked to the office. The simple walk seemed to take forever. They
had never gone to the office before. Actually, they had gone only
once, when they had gotten in a fight. Kyuubi had gotten angry when a
couple older kids had taunted his younger brother. Kyuubi had cuts
and bruises, but the other kids had gotten the short end of the stick
and had long bleeding gashes on their bodies.<p>When they
reached the office, Naruto shakily opened the door. Iruka stood with
the principal, waiting anxiously. There was an awkward silence as
silent tears poured down Iruka's cheeks. The principal looked at
Iruka, then at the kids. Seeing as the other man wasn't going to
speak, he did.</P><P>"They
have to hear this sooner or later, Iruka-san. Kyuubi." Kyuubi
looked up. "Naruto." Naruto did the same. "There's no other
way nor easier was to say this… Your parents are dead."</P><P><U>NOTES<BR>(1)Japanese

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>Chapter
1<p>Character(s)/Pairing(s): Naruto, Kyuubi, Sasuke,
Itachi<BR>Rating: PG-13<BR>Notes: Yeah. I hope you guys remember that
this will be shonen-ai.</B><p>Disclaimer:
Naruto and its characters don't belong to me. I gain no profit with
this fiction.</P><P>Naruto jolted up in
bed, sweating an exorbitant amount and panting. He wiped his face and
looked at his palm, not at all surprised at the hot liquid running
between his fingers. The blond grimaced at the smell in his room and
glanced to his nightstand. He didn't turn his fan on. Damn, it was
hot.<p>He spaced out, averting his eyes back toward his hand.
What a dream. He was confused and his mind was befuddled. He hadn't
had that dream in a long time. In fact, he hadn't even <I>thought</I>
about what had happened nine years ago. Naruto sighed to himself,
placing his hands over his eyes. More like, didn't <I>want</I> to.</P><P>All of a sudden, the
door slammed open, making the blonde jump.<p>"What
happened?!" Kyuubi shouted, obviously worried as he rushed to his
little brother's side. Naruto smiled, looking at his older brother.<p>His red hair had gotten longer over the years. His shoulder
length hair was now to his hips and his bright, red eyes were still
red, but the shine had left years ago, making them a dull mahogany
color. Naruto's blonde hair was still spiky and unruly, like his
deceased father, and didn't go past his neck.</P><P>"Naruto?" Kyuubi
asked, his voice laced with deep concern.</P><P>"I'm alright,
Kyuu-nii. Why, what happened?" Naruto inquired, wondering why his
brother had rushed in, so hurried, like that.</P><P>Kyuubi sighed,
relieved. He seemed calmer when he replied, "I woke up when I heard
you scream."<p>Naruto flinched. Kyuubi obviously noticed,
because his face looked stern when he asked, "Are you sure nothing
is wrong, Otoutosan?"(1) Naruto averted his eyes to the apartment
window.</P><P>"It was just a
dream…."</P><P>Kyuubi still didn't
seem satisfied, but he left it at that. He turned to his little
brother and flashed a smile.<p>"Get up and get dressed,
Otoutosan. We have school today." Kyuubi looked at the blank face
on his little brother and left, closing the door behind him. Right
when he turned the knob--</P><P>"Shit! I forgot about
school!"</P><P>Kyuubi smirked and
walked to the kitchen.</P><P>Naruto ran down the
side walk, trying to catch up to his brother. The first day of
school, and they were already going to be late. He struggled with his
school tie. How do you put these on?!</P><P>"Wait, Kyuu-nii!"
Naruto called, shouldering his slipping book bag. Kyuubi turned in
mid-run to look back. He jogged backwards as he ignored his little
brother's plea to slow down.<p>"What's wrong, Naru?" he
teased. Naruto looked up, pissed. He ran faster to catch up. When he
finally did, he lightly punched Kyuubi in the shoulder.</P><P>"Why didn't you
wait?" he asked.</P><P>"I thought you were
behind me." Kyuubi replied, half truthfully. Naruto rolled his
eyes.</P><P>"What's the name of
this school?" Naruto asked. "I forgot."</P><P>Kyuubi snorted. "It's
Konoha High, baka.(2) How did you forget so fast, I told you this
morning."</P><P>Naruto scratched the
back of his neck, laughing nervously. "I wasn't paying
attention…."</P><P>Kyuubi rolled his eyes.
"Since you weren't paying attention, you're in homeroom 25."
He reached into his book bag and handed Naruto a slip of paper.
"Here's your schedule."</P><P>Naruto gave it a
one-over. "Hey, I have Iruka-sensei for Homeroom!" He punched his
fist into the air.</P><P>Kyuubi looked miffed
when he replied, "I told you that this morning, too." Naruto
laughed.</P><P>It was Naruto and
Kyuubi's first day at a new school they had transferred to. Kyuubi
had heard good things about it and insisted they should go. And since
it was Kyuubi against Naruto, they went.</P><P>As the two neared they
school, they began to run again.</P><P>Itachi and Sasuke
Uchiha walked down the hall of Konoha High. Itachi was two and a half
years older than his little brother. He had jet-black hair that
reached his shoulder blades and was pulled into a neat ponytail. His
black, onyx eyes gave the impression that he could see right through
you and his fingernails were painted purple.<p>His younger
brother walked beside him. His book bag was slung over his shoulder,
and his black hair stuck up in the back. His eyes were similar to his
older brother's, yet were somewhat softer despite his harsh glares.
Both Uchihas were pale and seemed like they held no capacity for
emotion except for Sasuke, who just looked bored.</P><P>They were apparently
very popular, because every girl that they walked past would stare as
if they were the gods themselves. Every fangirl squealed when one of
them would so much as look at them.</P><P>Sasuke sighed when a
girl latched herself to his arm.</P><P>"Ohaiyo gozaimasu(3),
Sasuke-kun!" the pink haired girl cooed, batting her eyelashes at
him alluringly. Itachi smirked as his little brother got tackled by
another girl. The girl had her long, blonde hair in a ponytail and
latched onto Sasuke's other arm. She brushed her cheek against his
sleeve and practically purred.</P><P>"Ohaiyo gozaimasu,
Sasuke-kun!" she greeted.</P><P>"Ino, you pig! Get
your grubby hands off of <I>my</I> Sasuke-kun!" the pink haired
girl shot at the blonde.</P><P>Ino only stuck her
tongue out at the girl. "Nya, nya, Billboard Brow! Sasuke's <I>all</I>
mine!"</P><P>While the girls threw a
fit over whose Sasuke was, the raven looked rather pleadingly at his
older brother. Itachi didn't seem to want to do anything. In fact,
he only looked incredibly amused. Sasuke glared at him and spoke.</P><P>"Sakura. Ino." Ino
was holding Sakura in a chokehold, whereas Sakura was punching Ino in
the gut. They stopped what they were doing to look up at their only
true love.</P><P>"Yes, Sasuke-kun?"
they answered.</P><P>"I will never go out
with any one of you." The girls' faces fell. "Now leave me
alone."</P><P>"That's harsh,
Sasuke-kun." Ino pouted.</P><P>"What about
Itachi-sama?" Sakura asked, looking at Itachi, who was surprised
that the conversation had turned on him so quickly. "Yes,
Itachi-sama, will you go out with one of us?" Ino asked, trying to
sound seductive.</P><P>"No."</P><P>The girls faces fell
once more and the left, defeated. Once they were gone, Itachi turned
to Sasuke.<p>"See, Sasuke?" he asked. "It's that easy."
Sasuke shot a glare at Itachi and continued his walk down the hall.</P><P>As they walked in
silence, the bell rang. They parted ways with a quick "see you
later" to get to their homerooms.</P><P>Sasuke got to the right
door, which, of course, had to be at the back of the hall. He looked
at the sign next to the door.<p>Room 25.<p>He walked into
a crowd of high schoolers. To which all girls immediately shrieked
"he's in <I>our</I> homeroom!" and all guys groaned. Sasuke
ignored them and took the seat behind a boy who was wearing black
sunglasses. He looked a bit unsociable, Sasuke noted. As he sat down,
a man with a scar across this nose and brunette hair in a ponytail
stood at the front.</P><P>Sasuke learned that
this teacher's name was Iruka Umino. Iruka started to take roll.
Sasuke rested his head on the folds of his hands as he listened to
Iruka call out names.</P><P>"Shino Aburame.
Chouji Akimichi. Hinata Hyuuga. Shikamaru Naru. Haku Shuuichi. Gaara
Subaku. Ino Yamanaka. Kin Tsuchi. Sakura Haruno…." The list went
on and on until he finally called, "Sasuke Uchiha."</P><P>Sasuke stood. "Here."
When he sat, he could hear whispering.</P><P>Iruka opened his mouth
to announce the next name, the door slammed open.</P><P>"Sorry, I'm late!"</P><P>Sasuke and everyone
else turned to look at the blonde who had entered the classroom so
loudly. Sasuke raised a brow. The boy's uniform was messed up and
he was dragging his bag. He was panting hard from running and his
blonde hair was ruffled as if he forgot to brush it this morning. He
walked to Iruka and bent over, trying to catch his breath.</P><P>"Ohaiyo, huff,
Iruka-sensei. Huff." He greeted Iruka.</P><P>Iruka looked miffed.
"…Naruto Uzumaki." He called lethargically, raising an eyebrow
to the newcomer in his class.<p>"Naruto, you're late," he
stated, smiling in a way that didn't seem so friendly. "I almost
marked you absent."</P><P>Naruto straightened,
laughing nervously. "Sorry, Iruka-sensei. I got held up."</P><P>Iruka sighed and rolled
his eyes. "Class, this is Naruto Uzumaki, our new transfer student.
Please introduce yourself, Naruto."</P><P>"Yosh! As you heard,
my name is Naruto Uzumaki, my favorite food is ramen, my color would
be orange, I like gardening (4), I have an older brother in his third
year, and I just moved from Nagoya Osaka. I am happy to be here in
Tokyo with you all!" He flashed a great big smile at his new
classmates.</P><P>Everyone stared at the
blonde, who had said this all in one breath.<p>'Wasn't he
out of breath just a second ago?' Sasuke thought.</P><P>"Okay, Naruto. You
can sit next to Kiba and Sasuke. Raise your hand Kiba. Raise your
hand Sasuke." Iruka instructed.</P><P>Sasuke raised his hand.
Another boy who had chocolate brown hair and a red tatoo on either
side of his face raised his hand, as well. Naruto walked merrily to
the seat in between the two boys. As he sat down, it seemed as if
rays of sunshine followed him everywhere.<p>Apparently the
other boy thought so, too, because he shielded his eyes. The raven
smirked. Sasuke was surprised when Naruto spoke to him.</P><P>"Hello!" Naruto
greeted.</P><P>"Hn…" Sasuke kept
his eyes forward. Naruto frowned. "Hello…" Sasuke said instead
and Naruto seemed satisfied with his new answer. The blond turned to
look at Iruka, who had begun talking a few minutes ago. Sasuke
glanced at Naruto. He was too bright….</P><P><U>NOTES</U></P><P><U>(1) Japanese for

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><B>Chapter
2<p>Character(s)/Pairing(s): Sasuke x Naruto, Itachi x Kyuubi,
Kakashi, Iruka<BR>Rating: PG-13<BR>Notes: Yeah. I hope you guys
remember that this will be shonen-ai.<p></B>Disclaimer:
Naruto and its characters don't belong to me. I gain no profit with
this fiction.<p>Itachi walked into the classroom where he heard
the <I>loudest</I>
screams he had heard so far being at this school. He loathed being
popular. The raven clasped his hands to his ears in annoyance as the
girls all ran to his side. They asked him the most random and
retarded questions only that totally obsessed fangirls could possibly
want to know about.<p>"Itachi-sama, what's your favorite
color?"<p>"<I>Ooooh</I>,
Uchiha-san, where do you get your nail polish?"<p>"Itachi-kun,
do you like sushi?"<p>"Hey! What gives you the right to
call him that?!"<p>Itachi was trapped as the crowd of girls
punched and clawed each other. The other guys in the class jumped in
surprise when a blonde pony-tailed classmate with the left side of
his face wrapped so you couldn't see his eye almost got kicked. And
Itachi could have sworn someone had <I>bitten</I>
him as he tried to get out of the mess.<p>All of a sudden, he
felt a harsh yank on his arm as he got pulled out of the exorbitant
crowd. Itachi was dragged out of the scrimmage and plopped into a
chair with awkward ease. Itachi rubbed his back and looked up to see
his savior.</P><P>"Arigatou,(1)
Kisame."</P><P>"No
problem, Itachi-san." Kisame grinned.</P><P>The
girls apparently hadn't noticed that their quarry had disappeared
from the pile of people. They still proceeded to beat up each other
until the man at front had yelled, "WOULD YOU ALL JUST SHUT UP!?"</P><P>All
movement in the room stopped. A few didn't even breathe. Kisame
looked to the front of the room.</P><P>'Ah,'
Itachi thought. 'I almost forgot.'</P><P>Kakashi
Hatake was their homeroom teacher. He sat at the front at his desk
with his legs propped up on the said desk. That annoying mask hid
most of his features. He had silver hair and he was leaning on the
back legs of his chair, tipping it slightly so that it rested on the
whiteboard behind him.<p>Itachi and Kisame sweat dropped. Don't
teachers yell at the <I>students</I>
for doing that? He also held in his hand an orange book that was
titled, <U>Icha
Icha Paradise</U>.</P><P>Itachi
stared at Kakashi then looked at Kisame and asked, "Isn't the
freshman year homeroom teacher, Iruka, his bitch?"</P><P>Kisame
burst out laughing. "Very well put, Itachi-san. Very well put."</P><P>Itachi
shrugged, unimpressed. At that moment Kakashi got up off the chair.
He didn't set his book down as he addressed to the class.</P><P>"Everyone
to your seats at once." There was a scramble for seats and a couple
more fights for the seat next to Itachi. In the end, no one sat
there, afraid of Itachi's cold, yet sexy, glare.</P><P>"Hello,
and welcome to another year at Konoha. This is your third year,
right?" He asked the class. Itachi rolled his eyes. That man…<p>As Kakashi spoke, Itachi stared at the clock, watching as the
minute had slowly crept to the thirty-two point. But he couldn't
help hearing Kakashi's next words.</P><P>"We
have a transfer student. Kyuubi Uzumaki, please introduce yourself,"
Kakashi waved his hand airily and averted his attention back to his
book.</P><P>A
boy stood in front of the classroom. His crimson red hair and
matching eyes were hard to miss. He looked calm as he looked around
the classroom.</P><P>"My
name is Kyuubi Uzumaki. I transferred from Osaka with my younger
brother, Naruto. He's in room 25."<p>Itachi raised an
eyebrow. Wasn't Sasuke in that room?<p>"I like the colors
blue and red, my favorite food is chocolate, and I love video games.
I'm also the one doing all the housework, but don't expect me to do
all the work if I get partnered with any of you! And," he tossed in
as an afterthought. "I take judo lessons, I used to take Tai Kwon
Do and Karate, but I got black belts in those, so I moved on to
Judo." He flashed an innocent smile and looked to Kakashi to
indicate that he was done.<p>Something about how the new
student said it, made the class think that the added bit was more of
a threat then a nice new bit of information.</P><P>"Uh,
thank you Kyuubi-kun." Kakashi laughed nervously. "You can sit in
the empty seat next to Itachi-san over there. Either of them will
do." He waved his hand in the direction and sat down. As Kyuubi
went to sit next to Itachi, he flashed another smile at a girl who
looked at him nervously. Kyuubi sat down and whispered happily to
himself, "Yes, window seat!"</P><P>'Interesting…'
Itachi thought to himself.</P><P>"Nee,
Itachi."</P><P>"What,
Kisame?" He asked his friend.</P><P>"The
new kid's pretty hot." Kisame sing-songed, nudging his side.</P><P>Itachi
turned slightly pink, but ignored his friend and listened to Kakashi
talking about how drugs affect the mind and body. He wondered to
himself how Sasuke's first day was.</P><P>Sasuke
sat in class, bored as hell as Iruka droned on and on about integrity
and honesty. Honestly, it was the first day, and they were already
getting a lecture on unimportant crap like this. He looked at the
clock. In five minutes he would be let out of this classroom and into
first period.</P><P>He
jumped slightly to a noise from his left. He turned to see Naruto,
left cheek resting on the desk and a trail on drool coming out of the
corner of his mouth. Sasuke looked at the blond, debating if he
should let him sleep or wake him up and force him listen to Iruka's
lecture.</P><P>"Now,
everyone, it's silent reading time!" Iruka exclaimed. "Take out
a book and wait until the bell rings for first period."</P><P>Sasuke
thanked the gods and took out his book. He was a fast reader, and had
gotten a few pages until he heard a, "Psst. Uchiha!"</P><P>Sasuke
looked up, seeing his friend, Neji Hyuuga. Neji had long black hair
tied in a ponytail. He had a tattoo on his forehead that looked
frighteningly almost like the Swastika.<p>Sasuke gave him a
look that said, "What do you want?"</P><P>"The
new kid's pretty cute…"<p>Sasuke glared at his friend.
"Ugh, shut up, Hyuuga."<p>This class was strangely similar
to Itachi's.</P><P>The
bell rung, and it left a pondering Sasuke, a sleeping Naruto, and
their teacher. Iruka got up from his chair to walk to the two. Sasuke
shook Naruto to wake him.</P><P>"Hn…?
Hm, wha?" Naruto rubbed his eyes sleepily. Sasuke looked at Iruka,
who was advancing quickly. "Oh… Hello, Sasuke." Naruto said,
half asleep.</P><P>"Dobe.(2)
Why did you fall asleep in class?" Sasuke asked.</P><P>"What
didja call mae-" Naruto slurred. He didn't finish because Iruka
reached them.</P><P>"Hello,
Naruto. Sasuke." Sasuke nodded in acknowledgment. "Hey, Naruto. I
haven't seen you in a while. How are you and Kyuubi?"</P><P>"Mm,
fine, Iruka-sensei," Naruto replied. "Though it's not the same
without you."</P><P>Iruka
smiled. "I'll see you tomorrow, Naruto."</P><P>"Bye,
Iruka-sensei!" Naruto picked up his bag and exited the room. Sasuke
followed.</P><P>"So,
dobe, how do you know Iruka?" Sasuke asked, confused.</P><P>Naruto
looked annoyed. "Don't call me that, teme.(3) He's my
Godfather." Naruto shrugged, shouldering his bag. Sasuke realized
he was dragging his bag and slung it over his shoulder.</P><P>"That's
funny; I have a Godfather that's a teacher here, too." Sasuke
smiled.</P><P>"Really?"
Naruto looked at Sasuke, interested. "Who?"</P><P>"I
don't think you'd want to meet someone like him." Sasuke
chuckled.</P><P>"Wow,
Otoutosan. I haven't heard you laugh in a while."</P><P>Sasuke
looked up to see his older brother, smirking.</P><P><U>Earlier</U><BR>Kids rushed out of Kakashi's room as the bell rang for first
period.</P><P>"Are
you coming, Itachi-san?" Kisame asked.</P><P>"Nah.
I'm going to go pick up Sasuke. I'll talk to you later," Itachi
replied, putting his books away into his bag.</P><P>The
only ones left in the room were him and Kyuubi. Kakashi had picked up
his things a swiftly left the classroom, quickly dismissing them. To
Itachi's surprise, Kyuubi approached him.</P><P>"Your
surname is Uchiha, isn't it?" He asked, cocking his head.</P><P>"Yeah…"
Itachi answered, confused. "Why?"</P><P>"It's
nothing…" Kyuubi looked away. "You look like him…" he
added, almost inaudible.</P><P>They
left the classroom in silence and turned the corner. Went down the
same hall and turned the same way.</P><P>Kyuubi
seemed annoyed when he asked, "Are you stalking me?"</P><P>"No,
I'm going to room 25." Itachi answered. Kyuubi looked cute when
he was angry.</P><P>"Oh…"
Kyuubi said. "I am, too."</P><P>"I'm
going to pick up my little brother," Itachi stated.</P><P>"Me,
too!" Kyuubi's eyes brightened. "How weird is that?"</P><P>The
two walked together, talking about nothing in particular when Itachi
remembered something.<p>"Hey, you said something about me
'looking like him'," Itachi frowned. "What were you talking
about?"<p>Kyuubi's eyes noticeably darkened and the
depression had quickly faded, but it was palpable as long as it was
there. He looked like he was going to answer, but decided not
to.<p>"It's nothing."<p>Itachi felt bad, though he
didn't understand as to why. Later, they saw their younger brothers
together. They were walking down the hall towards Itachi and Kyuubi,
but they didn't seem to notice them. To Itachi's surprise, Sasuke
laughed.</P><P>"Wow,
Otoutosan. I haven't heard you laugh in a while." Itachi smirked.
The look on Sasuke's face when he saw him was priceless.</P><P>"Kyuu-nii!"
Naruto greeted, waving to his brother.</P><P>"Hi,
Naru." Kyuubi grinned. He turned to Itachi and asked, "Is that
your little brother?" He pointed to Sasuke.</P><P>"It's
rude to point, Kyuu-nii!" Kyuubi ignored Naruto.</P><P>"Yes,"
Itachi replied. "I'm going to guess that this one is yours?" he
added with a playful smirk.</P><P>Kyuubi
took Naruto in a one-armed hug and grinned. "Yup."</P><P>"It's
a pleasure to meet you, Naruto-kun." Itachi greeted. "It is nice
to see that Sasuke made a friend." Sasuke shot a glare at Itachi,
while the older just smirked proudly.</P><P>"Ohaiyo
gozaimasu, Itachi-san, is it?" Naruto asked.</P><P>"Hai."
(4)</P><P>Naruto
flashed a bright smile. "Okay, then. Good morning!"</P><P><U>NOTES<BR>(1)

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P><B>Chapter
3<p>Character(s)/Pairing(s): Sasuke x Naruto, Itachi x Kyuubi,
Kakashi, Iruka, Anko<BR>Rating: PG-13<BR>Notes: Yeah. I hope you guys
remember that this will be shonen-ai.<p></B>Disclaimer:
Naruto and its characters don't belong to me. I gain no profit with
this fiction.<p>Naruto walked down one of the school hallways
towards his first period, <I>Japanese</I>
with his lazy teacher, Kakashi-sensei. He walked, chatting with
Sasuke and his newfound friend, Kiba Inuzuka.</P><P>Apparently,
Dogbreath and he were very alike; loved pranks, being mischievous,
and ramen. Kiba was boasting about a prank he pulled on the principal
at his junior high and how funny it was when they had reached the
door to the class. Sasuke sighed dejectedly at the squeals that met
him as he walked in.</P><P>Kakashi
looked up from his book and sighed just as acrimoniously.<p>'Great.'
Kakashi thought to himself. 'Sasuke's here.' He looked back to
his book and ignored the squeals and hushed whispers.</P><P>A
couple of minutes later, the late bell rang and Kakashi stood,
yelling at the students to take their seats. He began teaching and
ignored the whispers and gossip the girls threw around, only to tell
them to shut up when one was getting too loud.</P><P>Naruto
glared at the board, almost challengingly. His chin rested on his
desk and his Japanese textbook lay open and forgotten beside his left
ear. Kakashi stood at the front with his back turned to the students.
He wrote on the chalkboard, while reading his perverted orange book
at the same time. The class had to correct him twice on his grammar
and spelling when he got distracted and started giggling.</P><P>Sasuke
began to feel concerned for his teacher/guardian, but not as much for
the blond, seeing as he hadn't even blinked while staring at the
board. Sasuke tapped the brunette, Kiba, sitting in front of him. The
boy turned around lazily.</P><P>"Yes,
<I>Uchiha</I>?"
Kiba asked just as lazily as he had turned around, propping his head
up with his arm.</P><P>"Is
he alright?" Sasuke asked, shooting a nervous glance at the blond.
Kiba shrugged and poked Naruto in the side.</P><P>"He
looks fine." Kiba bent over to get a better look at Naruto. He
pulled a disgusted face. "Eww, he's drooling…" Sasuke
sweatdropped.</P><P>"Is
he…" Sasuke thought for a second. "Asleep?!" he hissed at
Kiba.</P><P>Kiba
raised an eyebrow and waved a reluctant arm in front of the blond's
face.<p>"Holy shit, I think he is!"</P><P>Sasuke
rolled his eyes, aghast.</P><P>"Dobe."<p>"-ruto?"<p>Naruto's
eyes fluttered and he looked up, tired.<p>"Naruto?" Kakashi
stood over the blond's desk, chalk in one hand and orange book in
the other. Naruto nearly jumped a mile when he realized everyone was
staring at him. Kakashi seemed bored of this class, yet he pressed
on.<p>"Naruto, what's the answer to number nine on page
twenty-one?" Kakashi asked impatiently. "Are you awake
now?"<p>Naruto frowned, turning slightly pink. "Uh…" He
looked at his neglected book. "Um, it's 'shi'. I
think..."<p>"Good." Kakashi smiled, satisfied.<p>Sasuke
rolled his eyes. Kiba elbowed the blond and whispered, "Don't
scare me like that; you spacin' out like that was <I>way</I>
creepy."<p>Naruto laughed quietly at Kiba's over-concerned
face. Sasuke sighed and continued taking notes on Kakashi's
lecture.<p>After class was third period. The kids filed out of
the class in a hurry, either heading for their classes or ditching
their insane teachers. Naruto waved good-bye to Kiba who didn't
have their next class as the blond packed his things in his
unorganized bag. Kiba waved back and ran out the door and down the
hall. He then got stopped by the janitor for running in the
halls.<p>Naruto and Sasuke walked down the hall, heading for
Science. Naruto looked at Sasuke, studying him closely. Sasuke
glanced at him, uncomfortable.<p>"What?" he asked.<p>Naruto
looked quickly away. "Nothing."<p>As they walked and dodged
out of the way of a few stray kids walking to their class Naruto
looked at Sasuke again. "Nee, Sasuke?"<p>"What?"<p>"Don't
you think it's weird that we have so many periods together?"
Naruto asked, cocking his head to the side in innocent
curiosity.<p>Sasuke said nothing for a few seconds, just looking
at the blond.<p>'He's… too cute…' Then he actually
thought about Naruto's question. His mind drifted to his
guardian/teacher. Kakashi was a good friend of both the Uchihas <I>and</I>
the principal.<p>'Wait…' Sasuke inwardly drew in a quick
breath. 'That asshole… He did this on purpose!'<p>Apparently,
Sasuke was swearing under his breath, because Naruto was watching him
with a concerned look rivaling Kiba's.<p>"Now, now,
Sasuke-kun," a familiar voice called from Sasuke's right. "Please
watch your language at school."<p>Sasuke turned swiftly to see
the masked teacher and his Orange-Book-O-Doom, walking beside them in
the hallway. Kakashi seemed to be refraining from laughing, because
his mask quivered slightly. Sasuke glared at him<p>"Don't
you have a class to run, Kakashi?" he spat.<p>"It's
<I>Hatake-sensei</I>
while at school, Sasuke-<I>kun</I>.
And they can wait. Besides," Kakashi looked up from his book and
shrugged. "I thought you would <I>thank</I>
me."<p>Sasuke didn't reply and the edges of Kakashi's mask
pulled up, confirming that he was smiling; or at least smirking. The
three reached the door, Naruto confused about what they were talking
about. As they reached the door, a female teacher stood at the
front.<p>She had black hair tied in a bun, a long lab coat, and
her goggles were rested on her forehead instead of over her eyes.
Before she noticed the three, Kakashi disappeared, eyes wide in
fright, with an "eep!" and left the two alone in the doorway,
confused.<p>"Hm?" The teacher turned her head. "Ah ha…
Get your asses over here, delinquents!" She bellowed at the
latecomers. She snorted contemptibly and continued the speech she was
apparently interrupted in. "My name is Matarashi, Anko. Call me
Matarashi-sensei." She wrote it on the board. "And I am your
Chemistry teacher, obviously." She smiled a cruel smile that was
meant for scaring little children.<p>Sasuke walked calmly to an
empty seat, unaffected by their sensei's startling yell. Naruto, on
the other hand, yelped in surprise and rushed to an empty seat beside
a lazy looking boy, half asleep on his desk. On Naruto's other side
sat a girl with long blonde hair in a pony tail and hazel eyes. She
kept staring lovingly at Sasuke as he walked by. Naruto glared at
her, instantly disliking her for some reason.<p>Sasuke sat
beside a red head that looked as if he had insomnia. The red head
seemed to lack emotion. To his other side sat another boy, with brown
hair and purple tattoos on his face. Did the school let him do that?
Sasuke shrugged inwardly to himself and looked forward at the
teacher.<p>The farther they went through the class, the more
Sasuke realized that this woman, their teacher, was crazy. She loved
dissections a little…too much. He didn't even think that you were
supposed to do dissections in Chemistry. She laughed a lot and liked
using the yard stick to threaten disobedient kids.</P><P>At
the end of class, they had a pile of homework and she said, "Now,
just 'cause you're new and it's the first day of school,
doesn't mean I'm not gonna push you, delinquents!" she growled.
"Have a good day!" she added with a bittersweet smile after the
bell rang.</P><P>Naruto
turned to the kid next to him, asleep.<p>"Shikamaru,"
Naruto had learned his name in class. "The bell rang. C'mon."</P><P>The
boy, Shikamaru, sat up and yawned. "So troublesome…"<p>Kyuubi
sat up in his seat, gathering his things. Itachi sat beside him,
waiting.</P><P>Kyuubi
looked at the older Uchiha.<p>"It's recess, right?" he
asked, tired from reading so much out of a stupid Social Studies
book.</P><P>"Yeah."</P><P>Kyuubi
whispered his thanks to Kami (2) as he got up out of the chair. He
watched the other kids exit the room and followed as Itachi left as
well.</P><P>"Where
are we going?" he asked.</P><P>Itachi
shrugged. "We can go to the black top, snack area, a classroom…."</P><P>Kyuubi
raised an eyebrow. "Not the black top. Naruto's the hyper-active,
athletic type. I am hungry, though…" He checked his pockets for
money. Yep, he had money. But why would Itachi suggest a classroom?
Kyuubi shrugged it off his mind and ignored it.</P><P>Itachi
cursed in his mind. Ah well. They headed for the snack area and when
they saw a certain blond.</P><P>"What
do you mean, 'there's no ramen'?!" Naruto whined. Kyuubi
sighed.</P><P>Itachi
looked at the small blond curiously. "What is he talking about?"
he asked the red head beside him.</P><P>Kyuubi
looked at Itachi. "He has a ramen obsession." He answered. "A
big one. He saps my money at the Ichiraku's(3) down the street."<p>Itachi mouthed an 'oh.'</P><P>The
younger Uchiha was with the blonde, frowning.</P><P>"Of
course, there's no ramen, Naruto." He said. "It's a snack
area, not lunch area."</P><P>Naruto
turned on Sasuke, eyes gleaming. "They have it at lunch?!"</P><P>Sasuke
shrugged. "Maybe."</P><P>Naruto
jumped for joy and glomped the young Uchiha. "Yay!"</P><P>Sasuke
blushed and didn't even try to move the blond off of him. Naruto,
not realizing how uncomfortable his friend was, was almost on the
raven's lap as he rubbed against him affectionately.</P><P>Itachi
stood to the side with Kyuubi, who was laughing.</P><P>"…"

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P><B>Chapter
4<p>Character(s)/Pairing(s): Sasuke x Naruto, Itachi x Kyuubi,
Kakashi<BR>Rating: PG-13<BR>Notes: let's see… shonen-ai in this
chapter. Language due to Hidan. Hahaha.<p></B>Disclaimer:
Naruto and its characters don't belong to me. I gain no profit with
this fiction.<p>Kyuubi
walked down the halls, alone. School had been in session for about
three and a half months and the bonds between the Uchihas and the
Uzumakis had grown stronger. The redhead hummed softly to himself as
he looked out the windows of the building.<p>The kids that were
outside during lunch played and chased each other, laughing and
talking. A group of giggling girls dubbed as the "Uchiha Fan Club"
stalked an annoyed Sasuke with Naruto beside him, oblivious of the
glares he was receiving. Kyuubi chuckled to himself. Poor, oblivious
Naruto.</P><P>Kyuubi
knew Sasuke's feelings for his younger brother and he was fine with
that. Naruto seemed to be completely oblivious to it, but, knowing
his younger brother, he probably felt the same. Kyuubi was used to
the blond's lack of common sense. Normally, Kyuubi would have been
extremely protective of the younger Uzumaki, but he approved of
Sasuke.</P><P>Though,
when he thought about Itachi, he seemed to feel weird. He didn't
know what it was.</P><P>'Do
I … Like him?' he thought, blushing slightly.</P><P>Kyuubi
noticed something. Where was Itachi? He was normally stalked with
twice as many girls than Sasuke. The redhead felt a pang of jealousy.
He shrugged to himself. Ah, well. Maybe he's inside, too. Itachi
didn't like being outside. He smiled to himself and shifted his bag
on his shoulder, continuing his humming and his leisurely walk down
the halls.</P><P>He
reached the end of the hall to the staircase. Kyuubi began
descending, skipping three steps and making a huge ruckus. He
apparently made a lot more noise then he expected, annoying some
people downstairs.</P><P>"Fuck,
shit. That hurt my ears! God damn it!" A senior complained. He
silver hair and piercings on his ears.<p>Another senior beside
him said, "Shut <I>up</I>,
Hidan. You complain about <I>everything</I>."</P><P>"Heh
heh. Sorry," Kyuubi apologized. As he walked away, he could still
hear Hidan ranting and cursing.</P><P>"I
don't give a fucking <I>damn</I>,
Kakuzu! Just shut the fuck up, you motherfucker-" It went on and on
and on.</P><P>Kyuubi
grimaced when he left the company of the two seniors.</P><P>"Kami,
he cusses a lot…"</P><P>"Who
does?"</P><P>Kyuubi
jumped in surprise at the voice. He thought he was alone! He blushed
in embarrassment and turned, too proud to let the Uchiha see his
embarrassment. Itachi stood behind him, that obscene smirk on his
face.<p>"The senior back there…" he turned to point to
the end of the hall behind the Uchiha.</P><P>"Ah.
Hidan?" Itachi's smirk didn't go away.</P><P>"What's
so funny?" Kyuubi demanded, confused.</P><P>"Nothing.
It's just…" Itachi was beside Kyuubi in a heartbeat. "You're
cute when you're blushing."</P><P>Kyuubi
blushed deeper and tried to inch away from Itachi, who was subtly
moving Kyuubi's back closer to the wall.</P><P>"Um…
I-Itachi?"</P><P>"Hm?"
Itachi replied, moving his hands over the red head's hips. Kyuubi
blushed deeper. 'It's fair <I>now</I>,
Sasuke.' Itachi thought to himself, inwardly smiling.</P><P>"Wh-what
are you doing?" Kyuubi asked, panicking.</P><P>Itachi
didn't answer. Instead, he pinned Kyuubi against the wall. Kyuubi
tried, in vain, to struggle, but the Uchiha had a strong grip against
the smaller male.</P><P>Itachi
opened Kyuubi's legs with his own, rubbing against his thigh
against his groin. Kyuubi gave an involuntary groan. Itachi grinned
at the reaction, wanting more from the red head.</P><P>Itachi
smashed his lips against Kyuubi's hungrily. Kyuubi continued his
struggle but soon gave up, melting into the kiss. His eyes fluttered
closed, kissing back. Itachi attacked Kyuubi's mouth, sucking on
his lower lip. Itachi ran his tongue over the other boy's lip,
asking for admission. Kyuubi obliged, opening his mouth. Itachi
explored the wet cavern, tasting every inch of it.</P><P>They
finally broke the kiss for air, gasping. Kyuubi's face was flushed
and he still seemed shocked. Itachi smirked, wrapping his arms around
the red head's waist.</P><P>"I…
Itachi…" Kyuubi said. "We're at school…"</P><P>Itachi
frowned. "So?" He moved his hand from Kyuubi's waist to grab
Kyuubi's butt.</P><P>"Pervert."
Kyuubi shot, blushing and shoving the hand away. Itachi smirked and
rested his head on Kyuubi's shoulder. Kyuubi frowned. "Itachi…"</P><P>"No
one else is here."</P><P>"How
do you know that?" Kyuubi asked nervously, looking down the hall.</P><P>"I
just know," was Itachi's answer. Kyuubi frowned again.</P><P>Itachi
trailed his lips down the nape of Kyuubi's neck, licked Kyuubi's
bare shoulder, and bit down. Kyuubi gasped at the sudden action and
fought to stop the groans passing his lips as Itachi sucked on the
flesh. Itachi rubbed his groin against the other boy's and the
friction made both boys groan.</P><P>"Ah…
Itachi..." Kyuubi moaned out. Itachi smirked again when he finally
got the other boy to moan his name. His mouth worked up Kyuubi's
neck, leaving bruises. When he got to his ear, he lightly blew into
it, making Kyuubi shudder.</P><P>Itachi
shuddered as well and slipped his other hand onto Kyuubi's left
hip. He lifted the red head's shirt slightly and Itachi ran his
hand through Kyuubi's finely toned stomach and chest. Kyuubi
twitched slightly at the cold touch on his warm skin.</P><P>Itachi
slowly unbuttoned the red head's uniform shirt. Itachi took a deep
breath, breathing in Kyuubi's scent.</P><P>"Kyuubi,
I-" Right then bell rang for second period.</P><P>"…"
Damn
it.</P><P>They
could here the stomps of kids' downstairs coming up and
conversations. Kyuubi quickly buttoned his shirt again, blushing
before anyone came up. Kyuubi's messed up crimson hair and flushed
face looked <I>so</I>
cute.</P><P>"Uh…"
He looked very embarrassed over what just happened. "I'll, uh…
I'll see you later…"</P><P>Kyuubi
picked up and slung his bag over his shoulder hurriedly. Itachi just
stood, watching the other kids rushing by. He sighed and picked up
his bag as well.</P><P>"Damn."</P><P>"What's
the matter, Niisan?"</P><P>Itachi
turned quickly to see the smaller Uchiha behind him. Sasuke looked
concerned and the blond was behind him, too. Itachi frowned. He could
gloat to Sasuke when they got home.</P><P>"I'll
tell you later, Otoutosan."</P><P>Sasuke
shrugged and parted ways with Naruto. They had separate classes for
the next period. Itachi watched his little brother as he left and
smiled.</P><P>"Sasuke."</P><P>Sasuke
turned, surprised.</P><P>"Good
luck." Itachi smiled.<p></P><P>Sasuke
sat in his fifth period, thinking. He was distracted from his Physics
class from what Itachi had done. It was nothing he said. No, it was
something he had done. Itachi. Had. Smiled! How long had it been
since he's given a genuine smile?</P><P>Sasuke
frowned, trying to think of what would make him smile like that.<p>Itachi was spending a lot of time with Naruto's older
brother.</P><P>'Ah.
I see.' Sasuke thought to himself, smirking.</P><P>Sasuke
almost jumped when a thick stick slammed across his and his partner's
desk. The physics teacher, Genma, stood over Sasuke. He smiled at
Sasuke, almost too friendly.</P><P>"Are
you done daydreaming, <I>Sasuke-kun</I>?"
he asked in mock innocence.</P><P>Sasuke
glared at the Physics teacher that almost broke his emotionless
manner. He muttered a 'hn' and turned to his partner to continue
their in-class project.</P><P>After
class, he ran into Naruto heading to his next period period. The
blond ball of sunshine bounded over to the raven and greeted him.</P><P>"Hi,
Sasuke!" Naruto looked up at the younger Uchiha. His cerulean blue
eyes sparkled and his grin spread from ear to ear. Apparently, he
didn't like the uniform tie, and he had it slung over his shoulder.
Sasuke sighed, looking away to hide the slight blush.<p>"Sasuke?
Something wrong?" Naruto tilted to the side to see his face.<p>"It's
nothing." Sasuke looked at Naruto to show that there was nothing
wrong. He smiled slightly and Naruto smiled even wider.</P><P>"Yay!
Sasuke <I>actually</I>
smiled!" Sasuke half-heartedly punched Naruto on the shoulder and
the blond snickered.</P><P>They
reached their class undisturbed except for the few fangirls that met
them on the way. Sasuke frowned. Some of these girls weren't
familiar. Was there another stupid club?</P><P>Sasuke
shrugged it off and followed the other kids entering the classroom.
To Sasuke's relief, their math teacher was actually <I>sane</I>.
The tall man in front of the classroom had spiky, black hair and was
very muscular. He smiled to the class and introduced himself.</P><P>"Hello,
class. My name is Sarutobi, Asuma. Please call me <I>Sarutobi-sensei</I>."
He wrote his name on the board. "I apologize about not being here
the first three months of school. I had private matters to attend to.
I hope your sub was okay?" A few kids in the class just shrugged
while others just stared at him, bored.<p>"Now, I am obviously
your math teacher." He stopped, looking at the class, as if trying
to remember something. "This <I>is</I>
Algebra, right?" The class nodded in unison.<p>Well, close
<I>enough</I>
to sane.<p>The rest of the class was actually pretty fun,
compared to Chemistry. Sasuke shuddered at the thought of that woman.
Sarutobi-sensei introduced himself more, like his other job,
dislikes, and likes. As he was speaking, a girl at the back of the
classroom called out, "What time is it?"<p>The class was
silent for awhile and Sarutobi-sensei just stared at the girl, making
no expression at all, just staring, until she felt uncomfortable. He
turned around to the cupboards, opening them as if looking for
something.<p>The kids seemed to be confused and one asked, "<I>What</I>
are you doing?"<p>"I'm trying to find out where that came
from…" Sarutobi-sensei checked behind his desk. The class
laughed. "There's a <I>clock
</I>right
behind you, miss."</P><P>Later
after class, Sasuke met up with Naruto and Kiba, who had health next
door to their math class.</P><P>"Sweet."
Kiba grinned. "We all have P.E. together next!" He punched his
fist into the air. Shikamaru stood behind him and he yawned.</P><P>"So
troublesome…"</P><P>"You
know what, Shikamaru?" Kiba asked. "You're too boring. C'mon,
this'll be fun!" Kiba and Naruto grabbed their friends and
dragged them outside. "I think we're actually getting divided
into our groups today…"</P><P>They
left the building to go outside for their P.E. class. Outside there
was a blacktop that had a lot of painted white numbers on the ground.
Outside, a lot of kids stood over the numbers, chatting about how
much they hoped to be in each others' classes today. For the past
three and a half months, P.E. was, literally, just them hanging
outside, messing around and playing with the boxes of footballs,
basketballs, tennis balls, and a lot of other sports equipment.<p>The
four friends entered the giant group that was big enough to be three
classes. Kiba looked at his new schedule.</P><P>"I
have… Kurenai-sensei. Who do you have, guys?" Kiba asked.</P><P>"Gai-sensei."
Sasuke and Naruto answered, staring at their new schedules, as well.</P><P>The
three looked at Shikamaru expectantly, who sighed. "Raido-sensei."</P><P>Kiba
groaned. "Aw, you're lucky bastards, you two." He looked at
Naruto and Sasuke. "You two have the same class." He sighed
dejectedly and shrugged. He could get some new friends in P.E.<p>All
of a sudden, the loud screech of a whistle sounded. Three people
stood at the front on the grass, who were the teachers. Two were men
and one was a woman.</P><P>One
man who looked way too eager and wearing a green shirt and pants
removed the whistle from his lips. He had a bowl cut hairstyle and
the biggest eyebrows Sasuke had ever seen. Judging by other's
faces, biggest they've seen, too.</P><P>The
other man had a scar going from one side of his face to the other
side and wore bandages. He stood up straight and professionally. He
was wearing a t-shirt and shorts. He smiled warmly at the kids.</P><P>The
woman stood silently as her long black hair blew in the wind. She was
wearing a red shirt and denim jeans. Her red-painted lips pulled up
in a kind smile. Naruto recognized her as his kindergarten teacher
and merrily waved to her.</P><P>The
teacher clad in green was the one to speak.</P><P>"Hello,
my youthful students!" he greeted loudly. "My name is Mighto,
Gai!" He wrote his name in the air with his finger. "My <I>wonderful
</I>companions
are Raido-sensei," he pointed to the other male teacher who bowed
in acknowledgment. "And Kurenai-sensei." He wrote their names in
the air with his finger as well.</P><P>The
three teachers separated and stood in front of the columns of white
numbers on the ground.</P><P>'Ah.
I get it.' Sasuke thought. 'They're the classrooms.' Naruto
didn't seem to get it, because he tilted his head to the side in
confusion.</P><P>The
three teachers took out their clipboards. They called to their
students to stand beside the number box and wait as they called their
names. Sasuke and Naruto said bye to Kiba and Shikamaru and walked to
Gai-sensei.<p>By the time they walked over, Gai had already
started and was on number 37. "Hyuuga, Neji." 38. They waited
until he got to the U's in the last names.</P><P>"Urahara,
Chihiru. Uchiha, Sasuke. Uzumaki, Naruto." They sat on their
numbers and Naruto almost yelped out loud. Sasuke turned quickly and
mouthed 'What's wrong?'</P><P>Naruto
clapped his hands to his rump and whispered, "The ground is hot…"
Sasuke rolled his eyes.</P><P>"Dobe."</P><P>"What'd
you call me, teme?" Naruto hissed.</P><P>Sasuke
smirked and didn't reply.</P><P>The
rest of the class was pretty much like a lot of other P.E. classes.
Except for the teacher. He was way too excited and motivated and
pushed them a little <I>too</I>
hard.</P><P>"Ten
laps around the track, my youthful students!" Gai-sensei called.</P><P>The
kids groaned. More laps? They did as he said, and by the time they
were done, there was at least ten to twenty kids either sitting, or
laying on their backs, panting for air.</P><P>"Wasn't that
fun, my youthful students?!" He received many glares. Sasuke sat
next to Naruto, who was lying on his back in the grass.<p>Sasuke,
Naruto, and Kiba walked down sidewalk around the giant building as
the bell rang. Naruto was being obnoxious and was dragging his bag
while complaining about his over-the-top P.E. teacher. They were all
sweating profusely.</P><P>"That
<I>freaking
</I>Gai-sensei."
Naruto gritted out.</P><P>"Yeah,
I saw you guys from our class." Kiba grinned. "Bad luck, guys!
You got the Fitness-Obsessed-Teacher-From-Hell!"</P><P>"Urusai.
(1)" Naruto glared at the rock as he kicked it out of his way. He
looked around. "Where's Kyuu-nii?" He was usually there to walk
home with him at their old school.<p>Sasuke looked up. "I
dunno." Where was Itachi?<p>Itachi had Kyuubi pinned
against a wall when everyone had left the hall; a familiar position
to the red head.</P><P>Itachi
smiled and brushed his lips against Kyuubi's.</P><P>"I'll
see you tomorrow then, Kyuu-chan." And he left.</P><P>Kyuubi
tried to wipe the blush off of his face and picked up his bag. He was
trying to get used to this kind of treatment from Itachi, but it was
still embarrassing. The redhead slung the bag over his shoulder,
watching the long-haired raven walk away from him. Naruto was
probably worried about him.</P><P><U>NOTES<BR>(1)

5<p>Character(s)/Pairing(s): Sasuke x Naruto, Itachi x Kyuubi<BR>Rating: PG-13<BR>Notes: Shonen-ai in this chapter. And…
Yeah.<p></B>Disclaimer:
Naruto and its characters don't belong to me. I gain no profit with
this fiction.<p>Sasuke
walked down the side walk; his left hand in his pant pocket, right
supporting his book bag across his shoulder. He smirked as the blonde
walking beside him bounced along, a little too happy. Sasuke checked
his watch absentmindedly. They'd been walking for a while. His
house was on the outskirts of Konoha and apparently Naruto's
apartment was just a few blocks away, so they were heading to the
blond's house. He looked up from his watch, frowning.</P><P>"Naruto,
are your parents home?" Sasuke asked, afraid that they might get in
trouble.</P><P>Naruto
froze and he watched a butterfly floating by. Sasuke didn't see his
face fall, the unhealed pain flashing through his features. He turned
to his best friend, wide <I>smile</I>
yet dull blue eyes.</P><P>"No,
they aren't home yet."</P><P>As
the blonde laughed and kept walking, Sasuke looked, concerned, for
the other boy. Could he see sadness in that innocent <I>smile</I>?
The same <I>sadness</I>
he knew? Sasuke shook his head, dismissing the thought. He was pulled
back when Naruto spoke again.</P><P>"They
won't be back for a long while. Don't worry about it." That
<I>smile</I>
was still on his face. Sasuke wanted to rip it off.</P><P>Sasuke
looked at his watch again and looked at the darkening. He looked at
Naruto, who was whistling a quick tune.</P><P>"You
wanna come over to my house instead?" he offered. "I'm sure my…
parents wouldn't mind." Sasuke mentally frowned when he mentioned
his parents.</P><P>Sasuke
saw Naruto's eyes light up and that <I>smile</I>
had disappeared, replaced by a smile.</P><P>"Sure!"
Then he realized something. "I need to go home first and leave
Kyuu-nii a note to tell him. I'm sure he'd freak out if he found
out I wasn't at home <I>or</I>
at school." Naruto shuddered and added, almost to himself, "He'd
skin me alive…"</P><P>The
blond waved it off and began to skip down the sidewalk joyfully.
Sasuke looked around, seeing the faces on others walking by.</P><P>"He's,
uh, very energetic at the moment." Sasuke answered their awkward
stares.<p>Kyuubi just left Konoha High and was on his way
home. He looked around, making sure if Itachi really did leave.
Right. There weren't many people left after school, the programs
mostly being inside. Kyuubi looked around for Naruto. He didn't
spend much time waiting, did he? That impatient brat.<p>He
walked alone down the sidewalk. A breeze blew by, ruffling his long
red hair. Kyuubi sighed for no apparent reason to himself. He decided
to see if Naruto was home yet. He started to run down the street. He
turned the corner, almost tripping at the sudden turn, but
recapturing his balance.</P><P>On
his way, he waved hello to an old lady that he spoke to almost every
morning when he walked to school and helped a lost, little kid find
his mom.<p>Kyuubi sighed as he looked at the road. Cars drove
by furiously. They looked like monsters, not caring if they ran some
poor, little sap over. Kyuubi looked ahead. Where was the next
crosswalk?</P><P>Suddenly,
a car drove up and slowed to a stop not to far away from him. Its
driver looked familiar, but he couldn't tell who it was due to the
visor shielding his features. The man stepped out, his long black
hair immediately started to sway in the breeze. Kyuubi's faces
lightened up in relief.</P><P>"Itachi!"<p>Naruto
and Sasuke arrived at Naruto and Kyuubi's apartment. The apartment
seemed nice enough. It was connected to others and was on the top
floor, seeing as how Naruto bounced towards the stairs.</P><P>Naruto
fished in his pocket for keys as the raven stood to the side. Sasuke
stood, amused, when the blonde couldn't find them. He decided they
had stood there long enough when he stepped forward and shoved his
hand in the blonde's back pocket.</P><P>"Ever
thought to look in here, Dobe?" he asked, dangling the keys in
front of Naruto's blushing face.</P><P>Naruto
snatched his keys away from Sasuke without a word and opened the door
hastily. They walked in and Sasuke looked around, taking it all in.
It was pretty small and cozy. Naruto turned to Sasuke.</P><P>"Stay
in the living room, okay?" Naruto ordered.</P><P>Sasuke
nodded to show he understood and sat on the green couch. Naruto left
the room to find some paper and a pen. He came back soon smiling,
proud for some reason about finding the pen and paper. Naruto
scribbled a note and they left to Sasuke's place.<p>"Thanks
for the ride, Itachi. I hate walking through that. Damn Rush Hour."</P><P>Kyuubi
sat in Itachi's car in the front seat. He held his book bag on his
lap and smiled brightly at the Uchiha to his right. Itachi sat at the
steering wheel and he had let his long black hair out of his pony
tail, letting it drape over his shoulders. Itachi gave Kyuubi a small
smile.</P><P>"No
problem, Kyuu-chan." Itachi said. "I was driving by and I <I>thought</I>
that was you."<p>Kyuubi pouted slightly at the girly suffix
Itachi always added to his name. He was sure that the Uchiha <I>knew
</I>it
irritated him. Itachi seemed amused. The sulking Kyuubi looked so
cute. Itachi reached over the seat to pat Kyuubi's head.</P><P>Kyuubi
didn't shove him away or complain. He just stared out the car door
window.</P><P>They
arrived at Kyuubi and Naruto's apartment. It was quiet and almost
dark. Kyuubi dashed up the stairs while Itachi waited at the bottom
and stayed to make sure he got to the door. Hey, you never know what
could happen.<p>Two minutes later, Kyuubi was back, leaning
over the rail above the Uchiha.</P><P>"What's
wrong?" Itachi asked.</P><P>"Nothing,"
Kyuubi replied. "But Naruto left a note saying he went to your and
Sasuke's house." He pointed behind him towards the door.</P><P>"Can
I come up, then?" Itachi asked. He was answered with a pillow
connecting to his head. Confused, he picked it up and looked at
Kyuubi.</P><P>Kyuubi
laughed and said, "It was the closest thing I could find!"</P><P>Itachi
took that as a 'yes' and climbed the stairs. When he got to the
door, it was wide open and Kyuubi wasn't there anymore. Itachi
'tch'ed and entered, closing the door behind him.</P><P>Kyuubi
flopped ungracefully down on the couch. He leaned on the armrest and
rested his feet on the coffee table beside the green couch. His arms
were crossed above his head and he had a bored look on his face.
Itachi said nothing as he looked around the apartment.</P><P>Itachi
walked towards the hallway, seeing three rooms. There were two
bedrooms and one bathroom. "Which room is yours?" Itachi asked.</P><P>"Hm?"
Kyuubi looked up. "Oh. The door on the right is mine."</P><P>Kyuubi
got up to follow as Itachi looked around his room. There were
pictures on a nightstand of Naruto and Kyuubi and a lamp beside them.
There was a television across the room and a mirror on the wall
beside it. To the right in the room was a good sized bed.</P><P>Kyuubi
sat on the edge of the bed and sighed. "Oddly enough, it's boring
without Naruto annoying me here."</P><P>Itachi
smirked and sat by Kyuubi on the bed.</P><P>"I'm
sure Naruto-kun isn't bored," he said, amused. Then he turned to
look at the redhead beside him and pulled Kyuubi's chin to look him
in the eyes with his hand. "Would you like me to relieve you of
your boredom?"<p>Kyuubi blushed and gasped, to which Itachi
took advantage of. He lowered his face closer to Kyuubi and captured
his lips in a kiss. Kyuubi just sat in shock, not moving to
participate nor to stop the sudden invasion.</P><P>Itachi
moved one hand to grip Kyuubi's shoulder and his tongue entered the
already open mouth. Itachi kissed Kyuubi passionately and Kyuubi
finally let out a moan. Itachi smirked in triumph and pulled back
only slightly for air.</P><P>Kyuubi
sat next to Itachi, panting for air. His face was red and his crimson
eyes looked eager.</P><P>Itachi
leaned in and whispered in Kyuubi's ear.</P><P>"May
I?"</P><P>But
Itachi didn't wait for an answer as he gently pushed Kyuubi to lie
on his bed on his back. Itachi smirked at Kyuubi's startled
reaction. He bent down to kiss Kyuubi more aggressively, tasting
every inch of Kyuubi's mouth.</P><P>Kyuubi's
hands were in Itachi's hair, pulling their bodies closer. His heart
was beating fast as the adrenaline pumped through him. Kyuubi could
feel the warmth in his lower half and moaned again.</P><P>They
pulled away for air again. Itachi's face was close to Kyuubi's
and his warm breath hovered over Kyuubi's face, making him
dizzy.<p>Sasuke and Naruto walked side by side on the
street, Sasuke looked emotionless as usual and Naruto seemed
cheerful. Heck, Naruto was even skipping. Naruto held Sasuke by the
hand, dragging him almost. Sasuke sighed.</P><P>"Naruto,"
Naruto turned around. "Could you please stop skipping?"</P><P>"Why?"
Naruto pouted.</P><P>"Because
people are staring," Sasuke replied hotly, almost blushing.</P><P>It
was true, there were people staring at the blonde. A few were
snickering and pointing and some girls were squealing and taking
pictures.</P><P>"Why
are they taking pictures?" Naruto asked, confused.</P><P>"Nothing."
Sasuke shot the group of girls a dirty glare, but they just squealed
again. "Can we just go back to your house without skipping?"</P>

Naruto and its characters don't belong to me. I gain no profit with
this fiction.<p>Sasuke sighed as they turned the corner; getting
closer to Naruto's house. He cursed to himself and wondered why his
Dobe's house was far away. Or was he just lazy? No, that couldn't
be it. Wait, did he just say "his?"</P><P>"Sasuke?"
Naruto waved his hand in front of Sasuke's face. He looked
concerned and he snapped his fingers a few times. Sasuke glanced at
the blond to show that he was listening.</P><P>For
the whole walk, Naruto had been whining about how much homework they
had gotten and about how weird his teacher, Orochimaru-sensei, was.
At least he had stopped skipping.</P><P>Naruto
shrugged when Sasuke asked him what was so weird about Orochimaru,
since Sasuke didn't have him as a teacher.</P><P>"He
just creeps me out," Naruto had replied with a shudder. "I wish I
had listened to Kiba when he told me top find a seat in the back…"</P><P>Sasuke
chuckled and inserted his hands into his pockets. Naruto smiled as he
got Sasuke to actually laugh. He had heard from others that he almost
never laughed. Naruto made a mental note to boast about it tomorrow.</P><P>They
didn't speak for a couple minutes and Naruto got bored. He smirked
and yanked Sasuke's arm out of his pocket, catching the raven by
surprise. The blond entwined their fingers together, laughing at
Sasuke's taken-aback expression.<p>He was going to say
something when, out of no where, two girls walked up to them. Naruto
stopped walking so he wouldn't run into them, still holding onto
Sasuke's hand. Sasuke just glared at them for getting in their way,
but stopped, too, nonetheless.</P><P>The
girls were giggling profusely and Sasuke recognized one of the girls
from his stupid fan club and the other one was the girl he saw the
other day. One of them finally spoke up. It was a girl with dirty
blonde hair that could be mistaken for a brunette and she had
blue-green eyes.</P><P>"Excuse
me, Sasuke-kun. Excuse me, Naruto-chan." She smiled and they could
see that she had braces, too. Naruto was about to say something about
his suffix, but he was taken-aback when a bright flash interrupted
him. The girl pulled back giggling even more with her friend, a brown
eyed and brunette haired girl, who was holding a digital camera.<p>"Thank you!" the brunette called in a sing-song voice and
the two left.</P><P>"What
the hell was that?!" Naruto yelled, confused. Sasuke sighed.</P><P>"I'm
sure we'll find out tomorrow," Sasuke said, annoyed.<p></P><P>Itachi
and Kyuubi were still on Kyuubi's bed. Kyuubi was on his back and
his shirt lay forgotten on the floor beside the nightstand. Itachi
was mounted over the red head and his shirt was gone, as well. Itachi
bit and sucked the nape of Kyuubi's neck. Kyuubi moaned, which
aroused Itachi more. Itachi kissed up Kyuubi's neck and jaw line,
leaving a wet trail. He blew into the redhead's ear and smirked
when he received a whimper in response. He bit down on the shell of
the ear, earning yet another whimper and groan.</P><P>Kyuubi
gasped as Itachi grounded his clothed member against Kyuubi's.
Kyuubi clenched his teeth when the area between his legs began to
heat up. Itachi grazed his lips over Kyuubi's jaw line until he
reached his lips and, to Itachi's surprise, Kyuubi pulled Itachi
roughly into another heated kiss.</P><P>They
both battled for dominance, tongues wrestling. Itachi won and Kyuubi
let him enter his mouth. Kyuubi moaned again and Itachi ran his hands
against Kyuubi's ticklish stomach while the red head tried really
hard not to laugh. He reached Kyuubi's pant line and the red head
blushed crimson as he pulled them down to his ankles. Kyuubi lay on
the bed in only his boxers and when Itachi reached for those, too,
Kyuubi pushed him away.</P><P>Itachi
looked up, disappointed and confused.</P><P>"No,
Itachi!" Kyuubi hissed. "I'm still in high school! I can't
lose my virginity in high school!" Kyuubi was in hysterics now.</P><P>The
older Uchiha was inwardly pouting now, but he pulled back by Kyuubi's
wishes. Kyuubi was still ranting, blushing profusely, when the
doorbell rang.</P><P>Kyuubi
instantly shut up at the 'ding-dong' and jumped off the bed,
almost tripping. Itachi snickered playfully and Kyuubi sent him a
glare. The red head left the room and Itachi followed, thinking it
would be best to tell him to put some pants on.</P><P>"Kyuu-chan,"
Itachi called softly. Kyuubi turned to answer, only to be attacked by
his pants. They landed on his head and he put them on, laughing
nervously and saying that 'he was gonna do that.'</P><P>There
was a bang at the door of someone pounding on it and a "Kyuu-nii!"
Kyuubi rushed to the door and pulled it open to let Naruto and Sasuke
in. Naruto was smiling and chatting about what they did at Sasuke's
house.<p>Sasuke noticed that neither his nor Naruto's older
brother had a shirt on. Kyuubi's face and parts of his neck were
red. Sasuke smirked and cursed in his head. Damn, that brother of his
was fast.</P><P>"Nee,
Kyuu-nii," Naruto asked. "Why is your face all red?"</P><P>Kyuubi
blushed even more and Itachi smirked along with Sasuke.</P><P>"No
reason," was his genius reply.</P><P>Naruto
just shrugged and left the group to the kitchen so he could get his
dinner, ramen. He was humming to himself when Sasuke joined him in
the kitchen. The raven just watched Naruto cook his instant ramen in
disgust. Naruto looked annoyed.</P><P>"What?"
Naruto asked.</P><P>"How
can you eat that crap?" Sasuke replied Naruto's question.</P><P>Naruto
looked horrified. "This isn't crap! It's the food of the
gods!!"</P><P>Meanwhile
in the living room, Kyuubi and Itachi sat on the couch. Kyuubi
started to laugh when he heard the conversation in the kitchen.</P><P>"Is
he a bit… obsessive?" Itachi asked with a smirk. He furtively
inched his hand to rest on Kyuubi's thigh.</P><P>"Just
a bit," Kyuubi replied sarcastically, ignoring the hand. "I have
to deal with his ramen obsession every day. And if I tell him he
can't have any, he'll throw the closest thing nearest to him at
me. " Kyuubi groaned. "Last time, it was the toaster."</P><P>Itachi
frowned. "I didn't see a toaster."</P><P>"Exactly."</P><P>Meanwhile
back in the kitchen, Sasuke sat in one of the dinner table chairs,
nursing the bruise that the blonde had given him. Naruto stuck his
tongue out. Sasuke wanted to rip that tongue out. With his teeth.</P><P>As
Sasuke inwardly slapped himself, Naruto sat down across from him at
the table with his ramen. He clapped his hands together and chanted,
"Itadakemasu!(1)"</P><P><U>NOTES<BR>(1) I'm pretty sure I spelled that wrong, but it means "Thank you
for the food!"</U></P>

Yamamoto<BR>Rating: PG-13<BR>Notes: Shonen-ai </B></P><P>Disclaimer:
Naruto and its characters don't belong to me. I gain no profit with
this fiction.<p>Naruto awoke with a groan. The light that shone
in his face was too bright and blinded his vision. He opened his eyes
to see his window open, the curtains billowing slightly in the soft
breeze. He frowned when he didn't remember opening the window last
night. Naruto rolled over lazily and lay there for a few seconds
before his eyes shot open and he jumped, almost falling out of his
bed.</P><P>"What
time is it?!"</P><P>--In
the kitchen--</P><P>Sasuke
and Itachi sat at the dinner table. They had slept over at Naruto's
and Kyuubi's house on Kyuubi's invitation. Itachi was going to
drive home to get their toothbrushes, but Kyuubi said that they could
use the extra two toothbrushes that they had gotten from their last
trip to the dentist and weren't open yet.</P><P>They,
of course, slept on the couch.</P><P>Kyuubi
was in the kitchen, which was connected to the dinning room with no
door or wall. He had already dressed for school, but his tie hung
over his book bag, which was somewhere in the living room. Over
Kyuubi's uniform, he wore an apron as he cooked breakfast.</P><P>Sasuke
yawned and glanced to the hall when he heard the shriek of terror
from Naruto's room.</P><P>"Kyuu-nii,
what time is it?!" Naruto came dashing in looking like he had just
fallen out of bed; which he had. His blonde hair was even messier
then usual and he was wearing a white T-shirt and orange boxers.</P><P>There
was a moment of silence as Naruto just stood in the doorway of the
kitchen. Kyuubi and the Uchihas didn't say anything and the four
just stared at each other. Sasuke had to look away for a moment,
slightly embarrassed at staring at the blonde. Kyuubi almost burned
the eggs, and quickly removed the pan from the stove.</P><P>"Naru-chan,
why aren't you dressed yet?" Kyuubi asked, annoyed. Itachi almost
laughed when Kyuubi stood there, looking like a mother, wearing an
apron and his hand on his hip.</P><P>"Why
didn't you wake me up?!" Naruto shot.<p>"I did,
Naru-chan!" Kyuubi exclaimed. "I thought you were up, but
apparently you went back to sleep!" Naruto was about to say
something else when Sasuke interrupted.</P><P>"Naruto,
please. Just put some clothes on."</P><P>Naruto
huffed and stormed off to change into his school uniform. Itachi left
his seat at the table to creep up behind Kyuubi, wrapping his arms
around his waist and resting his chin on the redhead's
shoulder.<p>Kyuubi blushed but continued his cooking, trying to
ignore the added weight.<p>"You two are 'going out' now,
right?" Sasuke asked with an amused smile.<p>Kyuubi really did
like Itachi. He could be a prick, but he was really nice when he
could be. But, for some reason, that phrase 'going out' made him
blush.</P><P>"Yes,"
Itachi answered. "Is that okay, Kyuu-chan?" Itachi asked when the
red head didn't say anything.</P><P>Kyuubi
took the pancakes off of the stove and placed them on the counter. He
walked over to where he had left Itachi at the stove and kissed him
lightly on the forehead. When he pulled back, he smiled.</P><P>"Yes."</P><P>Naruto
entered a few minutes later, fully dressed and ready this time. He
pouted when he saw everyone had started eating without him and pouted
even more when there was no ramen.</P><P>"Naru-chan,
you can't eat ramen for every meal for every day," Kyuubi
reasoned.</P><P>"You'll
get fat," Itachi added with a smirk and Kyuubi punched him
playfully in the arm.</P><P>About
fifteen minutes later, all four of them had finished eating and were
out the door. Naruto was boasting about how <I>good</I>
his brother's cooking was and that he knew how to make ramen from
<I>scratch</I>,
too.</P><P>"And
I sorely regret learning," Kyuubi muttered to Itachi. Itachi
chuckled.</P><P>Much
to Itachi's and Sasuke's annoyance, a few more fangirls took
pictures of them. And not just them, either. They only did pictures
of Sasuke with Naruto and Itachi with Kyuubi.</P><P>"You,
too, Nii-san?" Sasuke whispered to Itachi. Itachi nodded grimly.</P><P>"Every
time I get spotted with Kyuubi." Itachi didn't look at his
younger brother when he spoke again. "You know what fan club
they're from?"</P><P>Sasuke
shook his head. "No idea."<p>"Apparently someone started a
<I>yaoi</I>
fan club and their business is <I>booming</I>."
Itachi frowned. "It, for some reason, revolves around us."</P><P>Sasuke
looked at Itachi disbelievingly with his best 'wtf' look. "How
do you know all this?"</P><P>"I
have good resources," was all he said.</P><P>Once
they had reached the school, they were bombarded by both the Uchiha
fangirls and the yaoi fangirls. Naruto and Kyuubi were not used to
this and had to resort to physical violence to be able to pass.</P><P>Kyuubi
and Itachi left for their classes and Naruto and Sasuke headed for
Iruka's room. Once they walked in, they were almost blinded by the
flashes of camera light. Once they were able to see, they noticed a
girl standing on her chair with her camera and boasting to the girl
sitting next to her.</P><P>"Ha!
I told you they'd walk in together!"</P><P>Naruto
looked at Sasuke and whispered, "What does that prove?"<p>Sasuke
just shrugged and they took their seats. Naruto then proceeded to
chat animatedly to his close friends, Kiba and Shikamaru.</P><P>Iruka
walked in and told them all to just read a book or talk quietly until
the bell for first period rang while he did paper work.<p>After
homeroom, the bell rang and they all left for first period. Naruto
hummed to himself as he and Sasuke approached Kakashi's room. They
ignored the few squeals when they entered the room and sat in their
seats.</P><P>About
ten minutes after the late bell, Kakashi still wasn't there. The
class was just about to leave when the door burst open and Kakashi
walked casually in and sat down in his chair. The class was extremely
angry when he said he had to help a student find the bathroom.</P><P>The
bell rang about thirty minutes later and they turned in their class
work as the students left one by one for second period. Their next
class was Social Studies with their teacher named Yamato Tenzou.</P><P>Naruto's
seat was to the right of a red haired kid with insomnia that Sasuke
had recognized as Gaara Subaku, from Kakashi's class. To Naruto's
right was a girl with brunette hair in buns and brown eyes. Her name
was TenTen. In front of Naruto sat Kiba, who was staring at a pretty
girl with pale skin and short raven hair. She looked very shy and
didn't speak to anyone.</P><P>Sasuke
sat behind Naruto and to his left, sat a girl with long brunette hair
and green eyes. To his right sat another girl that he recognized
immediately to be one of his obsessed fangirls. And she was not from
the yaoi fan club. Her strawberry pink hair was tied back and her
sparkling green eyes looked very triumphant that she could get a spot
next to <I>the</I>
Sasuke Uchiha.</P><P>She
tried to speak to him several times, but he ignored her and spoke to
Naruto and his friends before the teacher walked in the door.</P><P>Now
this teacher appeared to be normal, as well. He had messy chocolate
brown hair and had a warm smile. He looked like he was carrying too
many files and a student stood up to help. He set them on his desk
and asked the class to be quiet. When they ignored him, he suddenly
grew more ominous and stern.</P><P>"Quiet!"
He snapped and the class stayed quiet. Then, as if nothing had
happened, he turned kind again.</P><P>For
the rest of the class, he gave a lecture about the samurai and
Japan's legendary warrior, the Hitokiri Battousai. The bell rang at
the end of the class and everyone filed outside for recess. Sasuke
and Naruto had made it out without the fangirls clinging to them,
fortunately. Sasuke pulled Naruto into an area where hardly anyone
went. Luckily, no one else was there.</P><P>"Naruto,
I want to ask you something," Sasuke hesitantly began. Naruto
smiled and cocked his head to the side.</P><P>"What?"</P><P>Sasuke
opened his mouth to speak, but closed it, thinking of what to say.
Instead, he chose a different method.</P><P>Sasuke
leaned in towards Naruto, which made the blonde lean against the wall
behind him. Sasuke just lowered his lips onto Naruto's. Naruto's
eyes widened and he blushed slightly. But the kiss was over as soon
as it started. Sasuke pulled back smiling.</P><P>"Naruto,"
Sasuke began. "Will you go out with me?"</P>
