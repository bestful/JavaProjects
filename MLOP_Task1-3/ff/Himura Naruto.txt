have no intention of making Naruto insanely strong. He will at the

deep blue eyes before him. Eyes that had seen far too much. He knew
that this child had to know why he was hated. He didn't expect a
positive outcome, but he of all people had the right to know.</p><P>"Naruto… I know
that this is a lot to take in at once, but please bear with me. I
have yet to tell you of one last thing."</p><P>The child looked up. A
shred of hope in his teary eyes. If not for this bit of information,
the boy may crack and become exactly what he was accused of being.
That was the opposite of this old man's goal.</p><P>"What else do I need
to know, old man?" asked the child. Excitement returning to his
voice.</p><P>"Naruto… you still
have a family member alive. He isn't exactly like a normal parental
figure. And unlike many adults he doesn't practice very much, if
any ninjutsu or genjutsu."</p><P>With this, naruto now
had a grin on his face. Knowing that he would no longer be alone.</p><P>"But…" sarutobi's
lip twitched slowly into a smile. "He is a renowned master of
tai-jutsu, and his ken-jutsu us second to none."</p><P>Naruto was now confused
by this.</p><P>"What are you getting
at sandaime ji-ji?" he asked.</p><P>"Naruto… are you
familiar with samurai? he began. Only waiting for the boy to nod
before continuing. Well this man…your Grandfather of sorts…
happens to live here in Konoha. You are the heir to your families'
estate, and anything they've left to you. Once you come of age, you
will be allowed a seat in the Konoha council, but until then it is
taken up by your Grandfather. From this day forth you will go by your
true name. Himura Naruto" Naruto was now practically bouncing with
delight.</p><P>"This afternoon you
will be moving in with Seijuro Hiko. He was your father's adoptive
father. I'll be at your apartment shortly to help you pack up"
with this Naruto was dismissed from the office to do as he wanted for
a few hours.</p><P>Naruto immediately made
a sprint towards his favorite restaurant to tell one of the few
people who cared. An old ramen chef and his daughter.</p><P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>((Several hours of
packing, and ramen eating later))</p><P>A caped man walked
towards the Hokage tower. Earning the attention of many a passer-by.
His White cape was out-lined in red. He was taller than many of the
people in the village reaching the height of 6'5. His straight
Gray-brown hair reaching mid-back. He wore Black pants that were
loose and reached slightly past his ankles, and a blue shirt. Most
notable, were his ninja head band on his arm, and the katana in his
sash.</p><P>Seijuro always thought
the people overreacted because of the cape.</p><P>Naruto stared at the
man as he walked into the office. The man stared back. This continued
for a few minutes until Naruto jumped at the man and fiercely
embraced him in a hug. Seijuro smiled and lifted the 5 year-old onto
his shoulders.</p><P>"I supposed that
you're Naruto?" Seijuro said as he lifted the two boxes that
contained Naruto's possessions.</p><P>"Yep! I'm Uzu-… "He
cut himself off remembering his own new name.</p><P>"I'm Himura Naruto
That I am!" Naruto said excitedly.</p><P>Seijuro grinned <I>'I
like this kid already. He speaks like his father'</I> and with that
they left toward the Himura compound.</p><P>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>((At the compound))</p><P>Seijuro placed the
boxes in the room that Naruto chose for himself, then let the boy
slide down.</p><P>"Naruto… you want
to be a warrior for Konoha right?" he said. Watching naruto as he
nodded rapidly.</p><P>"I'll be the best
warrior in any of the countries!" he yelled.</p><P>Seijuro considered
weather or not to teach Naruto. After a few moments he once again
smiled, before removing the katana from his waist and tossing it to
the boy.</p><P>"Boy, that's my old
sword. Because of what you said I've decided to teach you the
secret sword style of our family: <I>Hiten Mitsurugi.</I> I think
that you have the potential to surpass even the greatest.</p><P>Naruto bore his
trademarked foxy grin and took the sword from the sheathe.</p><P>"Your training will
begin tomorrow and will be complete in 7 years. Once you begin the
academy, you'll have to be wary of your peers. Get decent grades,
but not the best, and always mask your power… Now then. Go to bed.
You'll need your energy for tomorrow."</p><P>Naruto flopped onto his
cot, and was immediately out. While Seijuro left the room smirking.
<I>'This will be the most interesting 7 years of my life'</I></p><P>((Skip to Naruto's
first day at the academy))</p><P>Naruto (now age 6)
walked alongside his Grandfather, who nonchalantly shrugged off the
glares and threats that were tossed their way. Early in the years he
had explained to naruto why they did this, and how to ignore them.
Honestly his opinion of the village dropped quite a bit when he
learned this.</p><P>"Naruto. Remember to
mask your strength. Especially in the presence of your teachers.
There will be no exceptions other than Hokage-sama. If they should
learn of you're abilities, then they may lead a group to assault
our compound."</p><P>Naruto, who had learned
to cast aside his façade of the blissful idiot nodded. Though
still far too hyper-active and Ramen-obsessed, Naruto proved that he
could be on a level of thought which unheard of for someone his age.</p><P>Seijuro noticed that
Naruto was a bit downcast and figured the reason must be the
inability to show-off right from the start. He thought for a moment
before grinning at the solution he had come up with.</p><P>"Naruto, If you can
manage to get through the academy without letting anyone who you
don't consider a friend know of your strength for the next 6 years…
then I'll give you your father's sword."</p><P>Naruto looked up. The
shock of hearing those particular words was evident on his face.</p><P>"Nani?! He yelled
excitedly. Do you mean that? I can have Otou-san's blade?"</p><P>Naruto immediately
shook himself. He mentally scolded himself for letting that outburst
go. <I>'To be a good ninja I need to be more serious.'</I></p><P>Once he saw Seijuro
nod, Naruto smirked and decided to speed up getting to the academy.</p><P>They arrived at the
building, and walked up to the receptionist.</p><P>"I need to sign in
Uzumaki Naruto" Seijuro smiled and said in a low voice. He
immediately saw the receptionist stiffen. He was surprised that she
didn't start yelling to 'Get the fuck out' as they so crudely
said in most places.</p><P>She put on a fake smile
and pointed Naruto in the direction of his classroom. Naruto
proceeded to run straight towards it. The only indicator of his
arrival was the sound of a slamming door.</p><P>Seijuro's smile
immediately changed to a scowl. Glaring angrily as he spoke.</p><P>"If I hear of you
EVER mistreating that boy (here he paused tapping the hilt of his
blade), then I'll take it upon myself to Behead you where you
stand."</p><P>He flashed a smile and
walked off. <I>'Naruto, try not to get into too much trouble'</I></p><P>Naruto rounded the
corner and darted straight down the hallway. He grabbed the handle to
door 210 and pulled it wide open, before walking in and slamming it
shut.</p><P>The class got quiet. As
this strange boy in an….Orange jump-suit? How unusual for someone
who wants to be a ninja to wear clothes that scream 'IM RIGHT HERE,
NOW KILL ME!'</p><P>The students spoke to
each other about this stranger's presence. Most of them knew each
other outside of school. A man wearing a blue-gray body suit and a
green vest walked in front of the class and began speaking.</p><P>"Everyone, this is
Uzumaki Naruto. He is a enrolling late because of some family issues.
To make him feel a bit more comfortable, please introduce yourselves
after class. Naruto since your up already, tell us your likes,
dislikes, hobbies, and dreams."</p><P>Naruto cleared his
throat and spoke.<I> 'I guess I should hide most of it'</I></p><P>"My name is Uzumaki
Naruto. I like many things, such as Ramen, I dislike people who think
shinobi and Samurai are anything less than equals. I also dislike
people who judge me for what I have, rather than what I am. (This was
directed at the man in the vest, who seemed shocked) My hobbies are
training, and learning from my Grandfather. My dream is to be the
Hokage of Konoha to earn the respect of everyone in this or any other
village."</p><P>The man (who naruto now
recognized as a chunnin) smiled slightly at the last comment.</p><P>"My name is Iruka,
and I'm your instructor for your time in the academy. Take a seat
next this boy right here." He said as he pointed to a boy in a blue
shirt with white shorts (who Naruto thought had hair much akin to a
chickens behind…but he'd keep that part to himself.)</p><P>Naruto walked over and
sat next to the boy. He seemed like a very quiet person. Perhaps a
friend later? Naruto began observing the possible friends in the
future. Here are his observations: <I>'This pink-haired girl seems
to be hopelessly obsessed with chicken head…The blonde with the
pony-tail is about the same…The kid with sunglasses seems like a
good choice…The kid with the pup seems a bit…crazy… but he
might not be so bad…pineapple head…I'll figure him out
later…This large kid with… underwear in his hair? I'll figure
him out when I figure out pineapple head. Lastly is the girl who's
been blushing and staring sin-</I></p><P>"NARUTO!" Yelled
Iruka</p><P>Said boy looked up and
said the worst thing possible at the time.</p><P>"Hm?"</p><P>A vein Bulged on
Iruka's head, and he began yelling.</p><P>"HAVE YOU PAYED
ATTENTION AT ALL TODAY!?!"</p><P>Naruto gave an
exasperated sigh.</p><P>"I'm sorry sensei,
but this concept is so ea-"<I>'Shit. I might've slipped up!'</I>
he caught himself at that moment.</p><P>"Ea-..Irritating."
<I>'Great save!'</I> He said a bit sheepishly.</p><P>Iruka raised an eyebrow
at this.</p><P>"Fine then. If it's
so irritating then maybe it'll be less irritating to clean the
classroom afterwards?"</p><P>Naruto scowled. <I>'This
is gunna be a long six more years.'</I></p><P>((Two years later))</p><P>Iruka sat in a chair at
the side of the school building. Speaking to the class.</p><P>"Today we will be
training your abilities in hand-to-hand as well as armed combat. I
would like two volunteers."</p><P>Iruka saw Sasuke raise
his hand and told him to step forward.</p><P>Iruka looked at each
student again, then stopped upon seeing Naruto who happened to be
sleeping while standing.</p><P>"NARUTO! GET UP HERE
AND SPAR WITH SASUKE" He yelled</p><P>Naruto opened one eye.
And grinned.</p><P>"I knew that would
work" he muttered. As he stepped forward.</p><P>Sasuke slid into the
basic Uchiha fighting stance. While Naruto merely spread his legs
slightly and raised his open hands to have the right one level with
his face and the left level with his chest. <I>'Ojii-chan never
said I couldn't mess with their heads'</I></p><P>Sasuke charged forward
and threw a feint to the left before spinning to the right and trying
to elbow naruto, who grabbed the elbow and lifted him over his head,
before smashing him on the ground… Upon impact the boy known as
Sasuke was replaced with a log.</p><P>Naruto quickly turned
around and swatted away the fist which was headed towards his face
before attempting to jab Sasuke's chest. Sasuke spun and kicked his
ribs. He dashed forward again and assaulted Naruto with a flurry of
punches. Sending him into the wall of the academy building with a
thump. Naruto and Sasuke both smirked. Though no one noticed
Naruto's.</p><P>The timer went off and
Iruka spoke once again.</p><P>"Sasuke win's the
hand-to-hand spar. Please prepare for the weapons match."</p><P>Sasuke pulled out two
kunai, and Naruto set one hand on the sheathe of his sword.</p><P>"BEGIN!"</p><P>Sasuke, now thinking
himself superior to Naruto Lunged forward with the intent to kill
him. But as he drew closer, He was blinded by a flash of light and
the feeling of pain in his right hand. He looked at his hands. The
kunai in his left hand was severed in half at the handle. But his
other hand had been cut at the knuckles. No deeper than a paper-cut.
Sasuke then looked closely at the kunai. A paper-thin line went
through it on both sides. Sasuke was ashamed. He had underestimated
an opponent to this extent. Itachi wouldn't have made such a
mistake. Sasuke scowled and walked back to the group. Who obviously
didn't see naruto move.</p><P>Sakura and all of the
Sasuke fan girls took this opportunity to speak.</p><P>"Naruto, you should
be happy that Sasuke-kun is merciful!"</p><P>"He would've beaten
you in 2 seconds flat!"</p><P>Everyone seemed not to
care about the fact that Sasuke was nursing his now bleeding
knuckles.</p><P>Naruto just smirked and
thought to himself <I>'Damn I'm good…but it would seem that my
</I><I><U>Battoujutsu</U></I><I> needs some more work."</I></p><P>"Yeah. You guys are
right. I wouldn't stand a change against <I>Sasuke-Kun</I>." He
grinned, and walked away. Leaving every confused about the sarcasm in
his voice.</p><P>Iruka couldn't help
but feel there was more to Naruto than meets the eye.</p><P>((Four more years
later. The day of the final exams))</p><P>Naruto was once again
excited that in the next two days, he could finally drop his façade.
Everyone would be so shocked to see his skills. And his true
appearance. At this naruto frowned. <I>'I'm gunna have to
remember that these kinds of Gen-jutsu take too much out of you…if
you don't happen to have a demon within you…'</I></p><P>"Uzumaki Naruto.
Please come forward and take your test." Iruka said.</p><P>'<I>Well… I'll
put no effort into this. I'll pass…but barely.'</I></p><P>With that in mind,
Naruto stepped forward and attempted to get 60 on every test. <I>'The
lowest grades are with the highest after all…'</I></p><P>((That night))</p><P>Naruto stepped into the
Himura compound and dropped his Gen-Jutsu.</p><P>"God damnit. Why did
I choose something so ridiculous? Orange clothes and blonde hair?
GAH!" he said as he trudged towards his Grandfathers room.</p><P>"Ero-Sensei! You have
something that as of today belongs to me!"</p><P>Said pervert's head
popped out of the door and glared at Naruto. Loosing a bit of Killer
Intent and yelling profanity left and right.</p><P>"You. Have. No.
FUCKING. RESPECT!" Seijuro yelled in mock anger. He then threw an
object at Naruto who began dodging before seeing what it was and
reaching for and catching it.</p><P>"Finally! This sword
has to have the best craftsmanship of any sword in the 5 countries!"
Naruto gazed at the blade starting at the hilt and sheath before
drawing the blade. The bottom of the Hilt contained an Obsidian
colored gem which had the Konoha emblem etched inside. The Hilt
itself was a black cloth with white twined in at some points to make
a black diamond outlined in white. The cross-guard was Obsidian X
inside a square. The sheath was black as well. But over the wooden
surface was Kyuubi no Kitsune all nine tails having the appearance of
flames. But unlike what most would think, this demon wasn't
attacking or roaring. It was sitting down with its tails waving. An
expression of sadness spread across its face. It was etched in gold.</p><P>The blade was worked on
by three people. One made the blade, one placed the seals, and one
made it a legend. The blade emanated a piercing white light. There
was no sign of it ever having been used. On the base of the blade,
just above the cross-guard Kitsune No Zetsubou was inscribed in
Kanji.</p><P>"That's the sword's
name."</p><P>Naruto looked up. At
his uncle quizzically.</p><P>"It's called that
for several reasons. And your father asked that I tell you when you
receive that sword. This will be a bit lengthy so take a seat."</p><P>Naruto ran and brought
some tea, before doing as he was told.</p><P>"The blade was named
Kitsune No Zetsubou because The Kyuubi who was sealed within you was
indeed in despair when it attacked Konoha. It was originally named
Kitsune no Kiba, but it was renamed…when the Yondaime Hokage
fulfilled your fathers dying request… Kyuubi was once something
akin to a protector for this village. But when The Yondaime Hokage,
Minato Namikaze, was elected, Orochimaru of the Sannin was enraged.
He had the desire to become Hokage. He summoned Kyuubi. He forced
her, and yes I mean her since she's female, to attack Konoha. She
wasn't capable of telling us this until she saw a familiar face due
to her rage. Your father stopped her… but not without paying a
heavy price. Your father managed to stop her by slashing through her
right paw with one of his mid-level Battoujutsu. But he had his lower
half crushed by her paw. When she realized what was done, she let go
of her rage… she asked to be sealed within you as penance… the
villagers never knew and took this out on you. Once she was sealed
within you, your father asked to have his essence sealed within this
blade. The blade was at first unable to contain your fathers essence,
but once it was re-forged by Shujin Higarashi, The blade became what
you now hold."</p><P>Naruto bore a sad
smile. A single tear ran down his face. Not one of hate, or sadness…
but because he was proud to be his father's son.</p><P>"Naruto… you look
very similar to him. You have your mother's hair and eye color, and
his style… I just thought I'd tell you that Kenshin would be
proud." Daisuke grinned and returned to his room. Leaving Naruto to
contemplate the information he was just given.</p><P>Naruto stood and
smiled. Tomorrow he would show his true strength and make his father
even more proud.</p><P>((The next day))</p><P>Iruka watched as the
students who had passed walked in. all except for the number one must
surprising ninja of Konoha. Naruto. He took roll and began listing
off the teams, when the door slid open.</p><P>A tall Red-haired teen
walked into the room. He had black ninja sandals and some loose grey
pants that went just low enough to not touch his feet. He wore a sash
with a Katana tucked within on the right side. He had on a formal
Black shirt with a grey undershirt. His red hair was messy and
covered his face. It was spiky, but drooped down to cover his eyes.
In the back he had it in a spiked pony tail. He moved his head up and
the rest of the students gasped. He had piercing blue eyes that for a
moment made all the girls forget about Sasuke. But the most defining
feature was the six whisker marks. Three on each side.</p><P>Everyone was silent…
Until he grinned. The slightly long canine teeth in his grin which
made him look like a fox gave away who he was.</p><P>Then Sakura nearly face
faulted after giving it some thought.</p><P>"UZUMAKI NARUTO! DROP
THAT GEN-JUTSU RIGHT NOW! YOU'RE MAKING EVERYONE MAD!"</p><P>Naruto's grin
immediately disappeared. And he took a serious expression that made
everyone in the room shiver. The room temperature may even have
dropped a few degrees.</p><P>"Sakura-san, I assure
you that this is no Gen-Jutsu, That it is not." He said in a voice
that sounded far too cold to suit the Naruto from before.</p><P>Now all of the newly
instated Gennins were gaping.</p><P>Iruka spoke out the
other's thoughts.</p><P>"N-Naruto…How?"
he sputtered.</p><P>"I've been using an
advanced Gen-Jutsu since my first year in the academy. The me that
you knew before wasn't totally fake… but most of that person was
indeed fictional."</p><P>Iruka gave him a
disbelieving stare.</p><P>"On another note
Sakura-san, That isn't my name." He stated.</p><P>Now Iruka thought he
was just being ignorant.</p><P>"Naruto you're just
lying now." He said in exasperation.</p><P>"No. I am not. My
name…Is Himura Naruto."</p><P>((Two hours and
fifty-five minutes later))</p><P>Naruto sat in a chair
at one end of the class room staring at the door. Doing his best to
ignore the Incredulous glares from Sakura and Sasuke. That is…
until he heard Sakura mumble something.</p><P>"I'll bet he's
just putting on this show to be like you Sasuke-kun. Seriously. What
kind of name is 'Himura'?"</p><P>Naruto's eyes
narrowed.</p><P>"Sakura."</p><P>She looked up at him.
Concern and surprise showing on her face. A little more and she
might even scream…Naruto proceeded to let out some killer intent. A
bit more than he intended though, due to a certain nine-tailed fox
within him.</p><P>Sakura screamed.</p><P>"OH MY GOD!"</p><P>Sakura-san. If I EVER
hear of you insulting my family again. Then I may have to kill you."</p><P>Naruto used his
Battoujutsu. He put his hand on the hilt of his brand new sword. And
attacked. He intended to just stop without hitting. Apparently the
glow of the chakra wasn't for show. A wave of white-energy burst
forward, Knocking Sakura and Sasuke down. If not for a certain
cyclopean intruder, it may have done even more damage.</p><P>"Sensei. Please be
punctual. Naruto said. I assume we should go to the roof?"</p><P>The man with the silver
hair nodded. And the trio went up. Two using the steps, and the
third… this brown haired-kid…just used a Jounin level technique
to get up there. One that only his sensei could use…</p><P>"Shunpo…this team
may be…problematic…"</p><P>With that, The Cyclops
used shunshin to appear on the roof and meet his team.</p>

Once again, I like constructive criticism if you do flame.</P><P>I edited chapter 1 and
made naruto stay with Seijuro Hiko instead of his uncle. He also now

roof of the academy, soon followed by the cyclopean man who had
restrained a dangerous blow earlier A moment or so after him Sakura
and Sasuke arrived.</P><P>The Cyclops then spoke.</P><P>"Now that were all
here, why don't we begin with your likes, dislikes, hobbies, and
dreams…starting with… Pinky." He then pointed to a still badly
shaken Sakura.</P><P>"C-could you please
go first?" she said in a shaky voice.</P><P>Cyclops smiled (which
showed in his eye) and nodded.</P><P>"My name is Hatake
Kakashi. I don't really want to tell you my likes…nor my
dislikes…I have a lot of hobbies…and…I don't really want to
tell you my dream either."</P><P>Sakura nearly
face-faulted, while Naruto and Sasuke both sweat-dropped.</P><P>"All we got was his
name…" mumbled Sasuke to no one in particular.</P><P>"Now then, if pinky
doesn't want to go, then you can go, tall dark and gloomy."</P><P>Sasuke scowled and
spoke quietly.</P><P>"My name is Uchiha
Sasuke. I have few likes, and many dislike. My goal… well… my
ambition… is to kill a certain man."</P><P>'<I>Typical avenger
isn't he?'</I> both Kakashi and Naruto thought to themselves.</P><P>Sakura took it upon
herself to go next.</P><P>"My name is Haruno
Sakura. I like…she turned towards Sasuke. I dislike… she turns
towards Naruto, with a fearful expression. And my goal…she once
again looks towards Sasuke."</P><P>'<I>God Damn it. A
Fangirl'</I> Kakashi thought to himself.</P><P>Everyone then turned
towards Naruto. One looked scared, another looked curious, and the
last looked utterly disinterested.</P><P>"My name is Himura
Naruto. I like training with my Grandfather, Ramen, and people who
are un-judging. I immensely dislike perverts, and people who base
there opinions of others on rumors. My goal is to surpass my father
in Kenjutsu, and become the best Kage possible"</P><P>Kakashi smiled, and
Sakura visibly relaxed. Whereas Sasuke just gave a doubtful look at
his Naruto's few words.</P><P>"Alright then, Team
seven will meet at training ground 36 for your true gennin test."</P><P>Upon hearing these
words the two boys were glaring, while the female of the group was
confused.</P><P>"But sensei, didn't
we already become gennin?" She asked inquisitively.</P><P>"True, you did take a
test to become gennin, but that was just so that we could judge
INDIVIDUALS. That's all. I'll meet you three tomorrow at 5:00. He
then turned as though he were going to walk through the door leading
down-stairs. And by the way, don't bother eating breakfast."</P><P>He then Shunshined out
off of the building Leaving a confused Sakura, a scowling Sasuke, and
a smirking Naruto.</P><P>((At the Himura
Compound))</P><P>Seijuro lay on the roof
over his room. Staring into the sky and contemplating the previous
night.</P><P>'<I>Kenshin…He acts
so similar…but THINKS so differently!'</I></P><P>((Flashback))</P><P>Seijuro and Kenshin
walked side by side towards Konoha. Conversing over the mission they
had just completed.</P><P>"Sensei, the
<I>Ryushosen</I> is more efficient with the Sakabatou! Think about
it! It renders the opponent unconscious and able to be bound and
interrogated, while with a normal blade, it would cleave off the
whole jaw!"</P><P>Seijuro tensed for a
moment before smiling.</P><P>"You have a valid
point…but with ninja these days, it's kill or be-" He stopped
when he noticed that Kenshin wasn't next to him.</P><P>"What's wrong?"
he asked</P><P>Kenshin cocked his head
to the side before answering as though it were the most obvious thing
in the world.</P><P>"Sensei, tell me…
what day is it today?"</P><P>Seijuro frowned.</P><P>"Today is Mond-.."
Seijuro slapped his hand to his forehead, as he watched his student
suddenly get serious.</P><P>"Today is double
ramen Monday at Ichiraku." Kenshin said.</P><P>"You shouldn't eat
so much ramen…it'll stunt your growth!" he scolded.</P><P>Kenshin glared and
spoke in turn.</P><P>"Nonsense, sensei!
Besides… if you know what's good for you… you will not hold me
back from my ramen…degozaro…"</P><P>Kenshin walked forward.
His attitude once again positive and happy. Leaving behind a
face-faulted Seijuro.</P><P>((End Flashback))</P><P>At this moment
Seijuro's thoughts were interrupted by a cheery looking Naruto
barging into the house with several bags filled with Styrofoam bowls
of ramen.</P><P>Seijuro could only
sweat drop at the absurdity.</P><P>'<I>I forgot that
today was a Monday...'</I></P><P>((Training ground 36
the next morning))</P><P>Naruto arrived to the
training grounds first and decided to enjoy the tranquility of the
early morning. He stood in the middle of the grounds and closed his
eyes. Visualizing everything around with what his grandfather told
him to call his "Hearts eye" he could feel the aura of everything
around. The slightest ruffle of the leaves was like an explosion to
his ears. The smell of rabbits, flowers, and… Sakura?</P><P>She strode towards him
then paused about two meters away.</P><P>"Naruto…I want to
apologize for what I said yesterday… It was just such a drastic
change. But…You helped me realize that I've been being...well for
lack of a better word, a bitch. Not just to you, but to everyone. I'd
also like to thank you for helping me realize this." Sakura stepped
closer and bowed slightly to Naruto.</P><P>Naruto in turn smiled
and replied.</P><P>"Sakura-san, I'm
glad you've realized this, but honestly I didn't strike with the
intent to teach you this. Just to tell you not to disrespect my
family name. He then turned to walk towards three stumps behind which
stood Kakashi and Sasuke. But to be honest, my blade wouldn't have
done more than bring you to unconsciousness. I don't wield a sword
to kill. I wield my sword to protect my precious people, and thus far
only one person is precious to me. My grandfather." Naruto then
slid the sword far enough out of the sheath for Sakura to see.</P><P>Her eyes widened
slightly.</P><P>"Naruto, your sword
doesn't <I>have</I> a sharp edge! Is it just a straightened piece
of metal!?" she asked now thoroughly confused.</P><P>"I'll explain how
it works some day… if we should become friends."</P><P>((15 minutes later))</P><P>Kakashi stood before
his gennin candidates. Speaking of the task he'd assigned them.</P><P>"You have until noon,
One hour from now, to get a bell. If you should fail to retrieve one…
then you fail. Now, Begin!"</P><P>The gennin-to-be dashed
in different directions.</P><P>Naruto knew that the
purpose of the test was teamwork, and went to look for Sasuke and
Sakura. After nearly losing some rather important parts, he found
Sasuke hidden in the bushes under the tree he was in. Sasuke didn't
believe it until he looked into Naruto's eyes. They were cold and
serious. They then went off in search of Sakura. She had been
watching Sasuke from across the field, and signaled her location to
them by reflecting some light off of a kunai into their eyes. Once
together, they began to conspire against their sensei.</P><P>"Sasuke, you're
going to charge in with a bunshin of me to distract Kakashi, while
Sakura uses a Low-level genjutsu to weaken his senses slightly. Once
this is done, I'll cut off the bells and charge in acting as though
I had the intention to cut him in half. After the bells fall, Sakura
will sneak in and pick the bells up." Sakura and Sasuke nodded and
got into position.</P><P>Kakashi stood in the
middle of the clearing reading his book. <I>Icha Icha Paradise. </I>He
giggled perversely then moved to turn the page. But as the page was
in mid-turn, a kunai whizzed from a nearby bush. Kakashi merely
side-stepped as Sasuke lunged at him, and Naruto attempted a kick his
abdomen. Kakashi pinned Sasuke to the ground and punched Naruto in
the gut…or tried at least. His fist passed through and the illusion
dissipated. He felt pressure on his back and was knocked forward as
Naruto slashed at him with his…Kakashi wasn't sure if he could
call this thing a sword. He grabbed Naruto's arm and tossed him
towards Sasuke. Naruto landed on his feet next to Sasuke, and both
ran into the bushes again.</P><P>Kakashi sighed and
reached for his book. But as he took a step forward he noticed the
lack of jingling. Eyes widening, he reached towards the bells last
known location. The string at his hip had been severed, and both
bells were gone. Then the timer went off. Kakashi smiled and called
to his students.</P><P>"Which of you two
have bells? The one who doesn't will be tied up. And sent back to
the academy."</P><P>Naruto, Sasuke, and
Sakura stepped forward.</P><P>"Sensei, we used
teamwork and thusly either all of us pass or none of us do." Naruto
said</P><P>Sakura and Sasuke
nodded in agreement.</P><P>Kakashi's eye
crinkled into a smile. And he spoke again.</P><P>"You all…pass…Team
7 will begin taking missions as of Tomorrow morning. For now, I guess
I can treat you all to something to eat."</P><P>Naruto's impassive
face split into a devilish grin. <I>'Kakashi will regret this day'</I></P><P>((Several Weeks Later))</P><P>Sasuke applied some
chakra to his feet as he snuck around some bushes and placed a hand
on the hilt of his Kunai. He prepared to bring this bothersome
mission to an end. Unfortunately, in the step he was taking to build
momentum for his Throw, he stepped on a twig. The target looked up,
and within a split second, a desert of yellow met a pit of black. The
damned cat dashed to the side at the last second.</P><P>"I SWEAR THAT THIS
CAT COMES STRAIGHT FROM HELL!" yelled Sasuke in frustration. "THIS
IS THE TENTH TIME WE'VE HAD TO CHASE THIS BASTARD TODAY. YOU DIE,
AND YOU DIE NOW!"</P><P>Kakashi, who happened
to be in a tree overlooking this while reading Icha Icha Paradise,
chuckled and watched Naruto try next. <I>'Hopefully he has a decent
plan. This is probably the single most trying of all D rank missions'
</I>"… I still wonder how the cat hasn't died yet…" Kakashi
mumbled to himself.</P><P>Naruto walked directly
towards the Sasuke and the cat. Said cat stopped screeching and
randomly running about, and chose to walk towards Naruto. Once the
cat was within a foot of him, Naruto merely bent down, and held his
hands out. The cat jumped into his arms and started purring
affectionately. Naruto just couldn't help but chuckle to himself.</P><P>"I wonder why we
didn't try that in the first place." Said Sakura who was too busy
being her usual useless self to notice Naruto's approach.</P><P>"Sakura-san, If you
were to space out like that on a mission it could be problematic for
me AND Sasuke…"</P><P>The pink haired
kunoichi instantly snapped to attention at mention of her precious
Sasuke-kun, though a look of utter horror was on her face upon
realizing that Sasuke-kun may think her useless. (Which we all know
she is… for now…) She then ran to Kakashi to get Naruto to not be
so mean to her. HA! If only he cared…</P><P>((Several minutes later
at the mission assignment desk))</P><P>A certain red-haired
swordsmen walked through the double doors of the office cat in hand
and squad in tow.</P><P>"Oi! Ojii-san! I
think that we've done enough of these petty 'preparation'
missions. You should give us something a bit more worthwhile."</P><P>A tick mark appeared on
Iruka's forehead and his face tinged red with anger.</P><P>"TREAT YOU'RE
HOKAGE WITH RESPECT!" he yelled. Unfortunately his fury was wasted
and he noticed upon seeing Naruto's reaction. Naruto tilted his
head to the side while giving a blank stare, and uttered one word.</P><P>"Oro?"</P><P>The Hokage chuckled at
Naruto's antics, surprising the entire group minus Kakashi and
Naruto.</P><P>Sarutobi calmed himself
and took a long drag on his pipe. After a minute of silence and
giving the situation some thought, he finally spoke.</P><P>"Fine."</P><P>After some protesting
from Iruka, and some whiny cheering from Sakura, The Hokage managed
to find the mission he had in mind for team 7. It was quite
simplistic, and they did have the most D-rank missions written down
after all.</P><P>"After giving some
thought I've elected to give team 7 a C-ranked mission. You will be
escorting the bridge builder Tazuna to his home in the land of
waves."</P><P>Naruto whistled a tune
to himself as team 7 walked down the road. He figured that since he
was bored the rest of the group most likely would be too. This
inspired him to whistle and entertain the entire group. He didn't
realize just how wrong he was about this.</P><P>"Naruto, will you
just SHUT UP?! Yelled a very irate Sakura. IF WERE GOING ON A
MISSION AS LONG AS THIS ONE, I EXPECT AT LEAST A FEW HOURS OF
SILENCE!" and as soon as she was done, it was indeed silent.</P><P>After a moment or so of
walking, Sakura began to think to herself about yelling at Naruto.</P><P>'<I>I may've been a
bit too harsh but…Well this is just great! Now I've gotten myself
feeling guilty…I guess that I probably should apologize though."</I></P><P>Sakura moved up towards
Naruto and was just about to apologize when senbon suddenly shot out
from the puddle she had just passed.</P><P>Naruto, Sakura, and
Sasuke all dashed in towards Tazuna to defend him, and turned in time
to se Kakashi impaled by hundreds of Senbon. There were three
different reactions. One was horrified, another was shocked, the
last… was indifferent.</P><P>To there obvious
relief, smoke exploded around 'Kakashi' and he turned into a log,
though just as the transformation was complete, the log was sliced in
half be an enormous cleaver.</P><P>Before Sakura and
Sasuke could react the man with the cleaver turned to them and
charged with blinding speed. As his blade came down, it was
intercepted in mid arc by a thin bladeless weapon, very much akin to
a sword in the hands of our young protagonist.</P><P>Naruto forced the blade
back and Kakashi came down from a tree, kicking the man in the chest.
Upon impact with his chest, the man exploded into water leaving the
group to absorb their surroundings.</P><P>A thick mist picked up
around the group and a deep voice called out to them.</P><P>"Seven contact
points. Brain, Liver, Lungs, Heart, Jugular, Larynx, and Solar
Plexus. Which would you like for me to hit?" The voice called
sadistically.</P><P>The person whom the
voice came from materialized behind Naruto who immediately struck the
man. His blade flashed a brilliant Azure blue with a white streak
within. It struck the mans guarding blade, and pierced nearly halfway
through before Naruto chose to speak to the clearly shocked man.</P><P>"You're blade has
anti-fatiguing, and anti-gravity seals… My blade has Elemental
seals. The moment you chose to attack me, you sealed you're fate."
He said in a very dark voice.</P><P>A Malevolent chakra
flared around him. It was a Midnight blue chakra aura visible to
Kakashi, and the feeling of his killing intent washed over the enemy
ninja in waves. Naruto's eyes came up to meet the man's own, and
the man was shocked by the evil, look of ecstasy.</P><P>"You're death will
bring me much joy." Naruto said.</P><P>He then brought his
blade down and through the cleaver. The appearance of his sword had
changed. It now had seals flaring in red, and the edge became
serrated, slicing and resounding with a chilling metallic sound.</P><P>Naruto's blade sliced
the man's forearm, and the man jumped back before the arm was lost.</P><P>"Momochi Zabuza. The demon of the Bloody mist... You are no demon,
but bloody indeed. Blood that will soon be mine." He said. His
normally bright eyes, now bled the dark Azure chakra.</P><P><I>To be continued…(:P)</I></P><P>I think that I'm
getting better at action sequences.</P><P>Anyway, read and
review. Be happy that I chose to come back to the story. I've kinda
decided, that this story is going to be very unique. I'm going to
be adding elements that I hadn't thought of until now.</P><P>I hope you guys don't
flame to much for the drastic change in plot that's come up, but….I
guess all I can say is shit happens.</P>
