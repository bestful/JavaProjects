life he had wondered why he was hated, why 'they' always glared
at him, why he had no parents, why no one would ever help him let
alone talk to him. For seven years Uzumaki Naruto wondered why he was
different and why he had no one there for him. For seven years he
wondered why he couldn't have a friend or any form of
companionship. For seven years he wondered why he was alone. For
seven years, to him as long as he could remember being alive, he had
cried himself to sleep at night. For seven years he longed for what
he knew he would never have. For seven years he thought this way….and
then he learned that he was never alone.</p><p>It was on a sunny day
in Konoha that a young and optimistic Uzumaki Naruto found himself
wandering the back alleys and lesser known shops of the Hidden
Village of the Leaf. Smiling to himself despite the glares and
occasionally curses that followed his wake, Naruto looked into the
large windows of the shops. Oh it wasn't that he didn't notice
the looks and comments…it was just that he'd become used to them.
After all, a lifetime of malice does that to someone. Reminiscing, he
stopped in front of one particular weapon's shop. He could recall
having entered the shop at one time or another , careful always to
sneak in unnoticed. 'Oh yeah, I remember looking in there. They had
those awesome shinobi weapons. What are they called? Kunai? Yeah!
That's it! Kunai. Someday, when I become Hokage maybe they'll
have to actually let me in there. Then again, when I become a genin
I'll need them so maybe they'll have to let me in. What was the
name of the girl that lives there…..Ten...ten. Yeah, Tenten. I
guess it doesn't matter though… Her parents never let me get near
her. They call me monster and demon just like all the others and then
run off….Her dad even threw that brick at me. Damn that hurt too. I
just wish I knew why they do that. I ...I don't remember doing
anything to them...I apologized too just like Ji-san said and they
just got even angrier...I just don't understand…the old man
always said to apologize when we make mistakes...but whenever I do
it...it just makes it worse… 'sigh' I wonder if I'll ever
have a friend…or…if I...if I'll always be...alone'.</p><p>Taking
a moment to slip into depression Naruto stared at his reflection in
the window. 'Why am I the only one with these whicker marks? Is it
one of those bloodsomethings? I remember seeing that girl at the park
with the white eyes and somebody saying something about it…then
again there was that other kid with black hair . They said he had one
of those things too but he looked normal. What was it? Uch ..ee
something? I guess it doesn't matter. Even if I did have one I
wouldn't have a fam..OUCH!'</p><p>His train of thought
broken by the white he was seeing and the sense of dizziness
worsening from a blow to the head, Naruto looked up to find Tenten's
father outside his shop and wielding some sort of clublike object in
his hand. Apparently, Naruto realized, he had angered the man by
lingering too long in front of his storefront window and too lost in
his thoughts, he failed to notice the man's approach.</p><p>" What the hell did
I tell you last time demon! Get the hell away from my store, my
family, and my home. I don't want your filthy face around here ever
again. If I ever even see you around here again, so help me I'll
KILL YOU!" With that said and a shocked Naruto already nearly in
tears the man began throttling Naruto over head. As blow after blow
rained down on his small body and his raised arms Naruto couldn't
help but cry and ponder what he'd done to deserve such a thing.
Soon enough the abuse and agony proved far too much for the child and
as his bones finally cracked and his blood ran free. He slipped into
unconsciousness.</p><p>It wasn't until much
later in the day that young Naruto awoke. Finally coming to after the
assault the young child screamed out in horror. It wasn't until
after five minutes passed of him being once more in his protective
ball and shaking hoping the blows would stop that he finally extended
himself and dared to stand. It was only then that he noticed he had
been tossed into a dumpster. Wincing, he realized that once again his
fingers on both hands and at least one arm were broken.' Why, why
do they always do this to me?' he asked himself. It seemed one of
the favorite targets of his assailants were his fingers...'They'
loved to break them…to…to crush them… to… Fighting back
tears, he forced the memories of his repeated torture to subside.
Luckily, this attacker hadn't taken the time to engage in the
'pleasure' so many others seemed to enjoy at his expense. This
time he had been lucky, his wounds were simply the result of a brutal
beating rather than….</p><p>After
once again shedding some tears, he pulled himself together and forced
his smile back on his face. It was hard, especially for a child that
had never felt love, to try and maintain such an image, but he had
found that showing his pain only egged them on more. The more
cheerful, the more …happy … he seemed the less the beatings came
and surprisingly, the less they hurt. He supposed that after awhile,
having forced himself to ignore the emotional pain they all caused,
the physical pain wouldn't come to hurt as much either. Quickly
checking his person over he realized that other than his new bruises
and broken bones he was mostly alright. Once again he was lucky.
Others had taken the initiative in ripping his clothing, shoes, or
other coverings after realizing that there was no way for him to ever
replace them or even have them repaired for that matter. During the
cold winters in Fire country that had contributed to his misery
greatly. At one time, it hadn't been that bad. He had had the
orphanage and granted, the staff and attendants had loathed him, but
at least it had been warm. Then again, his last year there they had
simply handed out thick blankets to all the other children except for
him during winter and had left the heat off. Even then it wasn't
all THAT bad. He still had a cover or rather, a sheet. It wasn't
until his cover had mysteriously disappeared and he had been
forbidden from eating any of the orphanage's food that it had
become unbearable. With starvation motivating him he had made plans
to leave. Not that it mattered anyway; before he even had a chance to
gather what few things he had he'd been grabbed and literally
thrown out onto the streets to die in the middle of a freak blizzard.
Luckily, the old man Hokage had found his shivering form in a
cardboard box in an alleyway. It was after that that things had
finally started looking up. He'd discovered his ambition of
becoming Hokage and becoming accepted He'd also been given a small
apartment, clothes, and even a little money for food from the old
man. It was great not having to eat garbage anymore though the only
thing he could buy enough of to fill himself was ramen. But hey,
after garbage, it was the best meal ever and the people there didn't
seem to mind him as much.</p><p>Coming
back to the matter at hand Naruto realized he needed to make his way
back home to nurse his wounds. In reality Naruto understood that he
needed to go to the hospital but having already visited there he
realized it just wasn't an option. The first time he'd sought
help and healing at the hospital it had earned him another broken
limb, several bruises, and some nasty scrapes. It seemed that even
people sworn to do no harm looked the other way when he was involved.
That fact became obvious when he had been flatly turned down and
flung out through a glass door with the excuse that they 'didn't
treat demons'. His second visit hadn't been much better. After
one of his worse beating an torture sessions via the villagers the
Hokage had taken him there. The only reason they did anything for him
anyways was because the old man had threatened. Even then their
'care' had hurt him more than it had helped. Really, what would
you call having needleds jammed in and out of your arms and veins.
Helpful?</p><p>Sighing
to himself and limping off to his apartment Naruto realized it
didn't really matter anyway. It would all be healed by the next
morning after all. Scrapes, cuts, burns, broken bones, stab wounds.
It didn't matter. It would always be healed by the next day. He
never told anyone, even the old man, but occasionally he would wake
up in the middle of the night when his more severe injuries were
healing. He'd see a red glow around his body and then a warm
heating feeling would pass through him and the wounds would be gone.
At first, it had scared him badly but eventually he took comfort in
the feeling. For some reason it always made him feel….like someone
was there, someone who cared about him. He knew there was no one.
That he was alone but still…he liked to tell himself that
maybe…that maybe there WAS someone out there that might care about
him.</p><p>Afterall,
the only other time he felt safe like that was whenever the old man
Hokage was around. Thinking on this Naruto found himself wishing the
old man was around more often. Maybe then he wouldn't be so used to
broken fingers and the taste of his own blood… He knew the old man
felt bad about him whenever he saw him. He could see it in his eyes,
but they never said anything about it. He knew the old man knew about
what happened to him. He'd often see different people more
restrained, looking sometimes even injured, after they'd done
something to him and they'd been talked to by the old man or one of
his scary friends with masks…ANBU they were called. There was
actually one of them that didn't even seem that bad. He didn't
like him. Naruto could tell that much. But he didn't seem to ooze
hatred like the others either… it was more like he was just
bored...or wanted to be off doing something else all the time…who
knows? What would some creepy guy with a wolf mask and Grayish hair
do anyway?</p><p>Finally turning the
last corner, Naruto let out a breath he didn't even know he was
holding. He was just a small distance away from relative safety and a
measure of comfort. He had been extra careful today when he ventured
out and he still was beaten. Ji-san had warned him that he would be
out of town for awhile and that he wouldn't be able to look in on
him for at least a week or so. Not that it would've stopped the
beating to day if he had been there…but his presence did deal
with…larger threats. Mainly, the mobs that would occasionally stalk
him, encircle him, and then attempt to butcher him. Many of his
…worst memories stemmed from these encounters. On each occasion it
was only the presence of the old man Hokage that had saved him from a
grizzly death. The old man had tried to play it down on him to stave
off the harsh reality that no seven year old should be met with but
he knew better. He knew what they were there for. Sometimes, in his
darkest moments, he wished they had succeeded. At least then, when he
thought like that, it would be over. Shirking off his negative
thoughts with a shake of his head Naruto returned to his thoughts on
the old man</p><p>" <i>Remember
Naruto-kun . I won't be here for awhile. You know that there are
many …people that are… not fond of you." The Hokage made smiled
grimly " Don't give them a reason or an opportunity to harm you."</i></p><p>"<i>Don't worry
old man; I won't let them get a hold of me. After all, what kind of
Hokage would I make if I'm all busted up permanently! "</i></p><p>"<i>Please
Naruto-kun.."</i></p><p>"<i>Hey I said don't
worry" Naruto flashed his trademark foxy grin " They don't have
a chance against the great Uzumaki Naruto!"</i></p><p>'Yeah,
they don't have a change against me….right' Naruto grimaced as
he cradled his arm. 'Oh well,' he mused 'At least I got home
after a little ramen and there's not even a mob'. When getting
ready to step out of the alley and into the open areas in front of
his apartment he suddenly stopped. Something was ...wrong. Taking the
time to slip into the shadows, Naruto hid himself. Silently, he was
grateful that he hadn't bought the orange jumpsuit that he had been
looking at for when he started the academy. For once, he felt the
dire need to not be noticed. Seconds later his gut instinct were
proven right as not just a mob but multiple mobs erupted out of every
entrance and exit to his apartment building. Squeezing himself into
as small a ball as possible Naruto slowly covered himself with
whatever trash he could find. A bag. A box lid. It didn't matter.
Making a small hole in his multi-layer camouflage Naruto watched as
the villagers stormed into his apartment in throngs. He had no doubt
in his mind whatsoever what they were there for…</p>

they show up) AND IF I SEE YOU USIN' EM' IM A' GONNA COME FIND
YOU AN' SMASH YA' KNEE IN! YOU HEAR ME!</p><p align="center">(how's that for a disclaimer? Maybe I should include a medical one
should anyone cross me and the law becomes involved)</p><p align="center">'never alone'</p><p align="center">CHAPTER 2……ok…more like 1 and 1/2</p><P>Sitting
up and wiping the sleep from his eyes, Uzumaki Naruto awoke to the
world. Looking around, he found himself in what appeared to be a
long, dark corridor that had, to his dismay, seemingly horrible
plumbing. That reasoning of course coming from the fact that our
young hero was sitting in no less than a foot of water and was now
sopping wet. Naturally, of course, Naruto voiced his disress. "
NANI? WHAT THE HELL? WHERE AM I? HOW THE HELL DID I GET HERE!"</p><P>Abruptly
standing up and putting himself on guard Naruto prepared himself for
the worse. After remaining tense for a few moments he calmed down and
took the time to examine himself. After a once over, Naruto noticed
that all of his wounds were healed. ' I guess that funny light
thing worked again.' sigh ' That's the only time the really bad
wounds heal this fast. I wish I knew what the hell caused it. Maybe
it could help me with some other things. Maybe, even… it could help
me become stronger?' Naruto paused to think about it.</p><P>'I
was thinking about it before, maybe I DO have a bloodlimit and I just
don't know how to use it. I mean, It's not like anyone would tell
me about it and I doubt they'd want me to know about it if it made
me stronger..afterall it's harder to beat someone if he ycna put up
a fight…' Naruto contemplated the past occurrences with the red
aura for a moment and then came back to the matter of his
surroundings. 'Oh well, that's for later. I gotta find out where
I am…AND how to get the hell back… to…….home.' Thinking of
returning to his home, Naruto couldn't help but recall the events
of the night before and the realization of the sad fact that ,for
all intents and purposes, he no longer had a home… His anger began
to surface; he could still vividly recall what had happened…</p><P><I>Still
hiding behind his cover of assorted pieces of trash, Naruto stared
out at the mob, acutely aware of his predicament. ' Oh man, what am
I going to do! ..if..if they find me.. they….they'll kill me!
They just won't stop at the normal stuff. They're for REAL this
time! Oh man, oh man, oh man, this isn't happening, this isn't
happening, this isn't happening…'.</I></p><P><I>A
shell-shocked Naruto continued his mantra of self-denial while the
throng scoured his apartment complex. Naruto only broke out of his
mental block after hearing the breaking of glass. Once more, Naruto
gathered his strength and peered out through his single hole to see
what had happened only to have his heart broken once again. The only
birthday gift he had ever received, a ramen bowl given by the old man
hokage, lay shattered on top of the pile of debris that once made up
his few earthly possessions. He wanted to cry out, to yell, to
shriek, to ask WHY but Naruto bit his tongue and stayed silent. </I></p><P><I>Having
swallowed his outrage and anguish knowing it would be the end of him,
he continued to look on as slowly everything he had ever owned ended
up in the pile. His clothes, his few books and scrolls, his bed, his
<B>curtains</B>, literally everything... He figured that he could at
least rummage through what was left once everything settled down but
his hopes were crushed when an irate villager with a torch approached
the pile and set it aflame. Shocked by the sheer animosity of the
villagers he entered a sort of emotional shock. 'Well' Naruto
mused to himself, 'I guess at least tonight I won't be
cold…Still, it's going to suck having to clean up the house. Heh
heh heh. It's going to be painful sleeping on the floor too. Maybe
I'll…'. </I></p><P><I>Naruto trailed off in his thoughts as his eyes widened in horror.
Spurred on by the sight of the bonfire, the villagers had decided to
take the initiative and erase all signs of his existence…by burning
the entire complex down. Too shocked to even think , naruto slowly
closed his eye hole and leaned back against a dumpster. Considering
his security, he realized that in all scenarios his best option was
to stay still until things died down…way down. He was close to
where they thought he would eventually return one way or another and
he knew he wouldn't be able to outrun them. 'the old man..' he
thought ' he was always able to find me no matter what…I…I
just.. I.just have to wait till he finds me. ..He...he can fix this.
He...he always can…I ...just ... I..just have to wait for him to
find me..'. Exhausted and tired from the strain of the day's
events, Naruto slipped off into sleep, but not before he noticed the
familiar wisps of red beginning to evelop his body…</I></p><P>'yeah'
Naruto thought , ' Well I still have to find out where the hell I
am and how to get out of here. By now, maybe Ji-san is back…' A
spike of rage coursed through him,' Goddamn, villagers! I oughta go
and burn THEIR houses down!' Realizing his thoughts were clouded by
anger, Naruto calmed himself and made his declaration to the open
air. "No…no revenge …is…not the answer. Ji-san has taught me
that much! If I am to become Hokage and PROVE to these BASTARDS that
I'm not some monster I have to move beyond this. I won't let them
turn me into a monster. I AM UZUMAKI NARUTO DAMN IT, THE FUTURE
HOKAGE, AND I AM ABOVE THIS!"</p><P>Heaving
slightly from having shouted his declaration to the world… and at
the same time emptying his lungs of all air, Naruto decided to go
ahead and see just was down at end of the hallway. Afterall, he
mused, it's not like they don't know I'm here… at least not
now anyways. He scratched the back of his head. 'Yeah'…'
Let's go!'. With that, he put one foot in front of the other and
made his way down the hall.</p><P>Looking
around, Naruto realized that wherever he was, it definitely sucked.
'Man, I hope this isn't a dungeon or something… hell…probably
is. Those sick shits!'Naruto took a moment to stop and catch him
self. 'Whoops, I gotta stop that. Ji-san got on to me about cursing
like that all the time.' Grumbles to him self 'If it was anyone
else I'd tell em' to…well…. To do stuff...probably to
themselves… or a dog .' Snickers 'Oh well, I gotta stop… But
seriously! They probably want to torture me some more before they end
it all… Then again, now that they have me in here…wherever the
hell this place is… they might just try to keep me alive and
torture me all the time… To hell with that! I'll find a way to
end it MYSELF before I let that happen to me!'</p><P>Naruto
continued his mental rambling with the thoughts on his current
whereabouts and future getting progressively worse. He began to tire
from his trek and began looking for a semi-dry place. He was starting
to contemplate the idea of crawling up into the pipes above him or to
the side when he came across a large open dry raised area with
horizontal bars going from the floor to the ceiling. Inspecting the
bars he saw what appeared to be the gate that could allow him
through. Noticing a piece of paper that seemed to be just out of his
reach he moved to read it. Inspecting it, he discovered that it read 
'SEAL' . 'I wonder what in the hell that means? Oh well, I'm
tired, I think I'll rest here a bit before I plan my next move.'
Turning around, Naruto sat down and braced his back against the gate.
Naruto enjoyed being able to sit down and said as much to no one in
particular, not expecting a response. "Wow, it feels good being
able to sit down after that damn walk, it took forever to get here."</p><P>"
<B>Yes, it did. I was beginning to wonder if you'd ever make it…"</B></p><P>Hello to anyone reading
this fic. Thanks for the support so far. I appreciate the comments
and I'll try to address a comment or two.</p><P>Naruto is not
going to be evil in this fic nor is he planning to destroy Konoha.
He has stated that he's goingto become Hokage and damn it, Uzumaki
NAruto never goes back on his word.</p><P>Uh…sorry, that
was the only question that really came up?</p><P>Well,
I guess that about does it for this chapter. Sorry if it's taking
too long for you guys to even get to the good stuff. I'm just
trying to be descriptive. Perhaps I'm a little too wordy? Well, oh
god, just wait till we get to the battle scenes neh? I've got most
of the plot outlined and a slew of technique, training, and character
interaction ideas. I'm most proud of the original concepts I've
come up with. You'll see a couple few of them (the most important
ones at least) come up in the next few chapter. Right now I've got
major problems with technique/skill translations so if my translation
comes of jittery ( as in absolutely deplorable) let me know how to
fix it. Thanks again for any comments or any insults for that matter,
in fact, if you can, please do insult me. I like to collect them and
use them on the other really bad fics I read here and there. Ha ha
ha….ha ha ha…ok…moment over. See ya</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p align="center">DISCLAIMER:
No, no I still don't own Naruto…and I still haven't managed to
buy my soul back either…..But….I do still own my original
concepts..so if I see you use them…I…WILL…FIND…YOU</p><p align="center">'peers
into depths of your soul'</p><p align="center">'never
alone'</p><p align="center">CHAPTER 
3: or rather the real ch.2? Evenatually it'll balance out….maybe</p><P>Hearing a voice come
from right behind, Naruto reacted in a manner which was quickly
becoming a habit for him. "BAAAAAAH!" shooting up quickly (with
shock having already lifted him several feet into the air) and moving
away from the gate, Naruto turned around to face the source of the
voice. Seeing no one there, but certain that voice the came from
somewhere behind him in the darkness and spoke, unfortunately, he did
so assuming the voice was the person that had placed him in the murky
dungeon… "WHO IS THAT? COME ON OUT! YOU WANT A PIECE OF ME?
FIGHT ME LIKE A MAN!"</p><P>Having
made his rambling and shaky statement, Naruto took up a defensive
stance and readied himself for what ever attack followed. It was then
that a deep, sort of ...purring? voice spoke out. <B>"Really now
Naruto-kun, must you always react in such a way when you're
surprised?" </B>the voice in the darkness dropped off into light
laughter and then settled down. <B>"It's rather obnoxious,
especially in such…confining… surroundings…though; I must admit
it can be amusing at times." </B>Naruto wasn't sure but he
thought he saw the vague outline of the person speaking…though, if
it was, it wasn't a person. Afterall, <I>people</I> aren't over
three to four stories tall…</p><P>Trying
to focus his eyes in on the form, Naruto found he couldn't see the
vague outline anymore.Hearing steps being made, Naruto
brought his focus back down and in front of him just in time to see
the "voice" come out of the darkness. What emerged from the inky
blackness shocked Naruto. Now standing before him was the single most
beautiful woman Naruto had ever seen in his life…period. First and
foremost was her face, a face that Naruto could only describe as
somehow angelic…though something told him that just wasn't quite
right. Crimson red eyes that seemed to glow with an unknown energy
gazed into his own cerulean blue and Naruto found himself wanting to
lose himself in her …comforting…gaze? Forcing himself to break
eye contact, he saw that beneath her glowing orbs lay a foxy grin
that promised mischief of sorts. Moving his eyes back up and above
her eyes, he found that her hair shared the deep red color of her
eyes and reached down to her waist level. Having followed the hair
down her waist, he took notice of her dress.</p><P>Or
rather, of her kimono, a snow white one at that, with what appeared
to have ruby red lining and a matching sash of sorts across the
middle. Looking closer he found that all around the seams and in
certain areas characters and figures were present. Taking time to
observe the intricate patterns and designs across her kimono, he saw
what looked like a language he couldn't really understand. Among
the pictures though, he noticed a nine-tail fox…It also seemed,
after more studying, that the kimono was intended for both battle and
formal occasions. This conclusion coming from the fact that the
kimono came down low near the top and revealed a more than decent
degree of cleavage, though Naruto wasn't really taking notice at
the time, afterall, he was a seven year old. Near the bottom it
reached down only to a small ways below her knees giving, once again,
a generous look at her flesh, in this case her legs. Observing her
legs, arms, hands, and face once again he found her skin to be a sort
of creamy, lightly tanned color… If he had been a little bit more
observant, he probably would've noticed the nine red tails swaying
to and fro behind and around her as well…What he did notice though
was the blade at her side. Once again, the strange characters were
present as they were carved on both the hilt and sheath of the blade.
'wow' Naruto thought ' what an awesome looking sword…'</p><P>Once having taken in the full measure of her beauty and general
appearance, all the words Naruto had formed in the back of his throat
to chastise the source of his mockery and surprise caught together
and refused to come out. Unknowingly, he sputtered his mix of
conscious and subconscious out in the one word his seven year old
mind could come up with to her describe her on all fronts. "..
.beautiful…"</p><P>Blushing
a bit from Naruto's first real response to her, the woman replied
in a now normal tone, except for a slight purring that is….<B> "</B>Why
thank you Naruto-kun<B>. "</B> Wondering how the woman knew how to
respond to what he had only thought, the reality of the situation
sunk in on Naruto and a dark scarlet blush found its way to his
cheeks while he stuttered. " ummm I uh …uh ..I..uh.." . <B>"</B>Yes,
Naruto-kun<B>?" </B>the woman replied in a half-chuckle. Recovering
from his blush, Naruto decided to get down to business. After all, he
was stuck in some dungeon he had been walking in for hours and she
was his best chance for answers. He didn't even need to bring up
the fact that the last time he had been conscious he had been in
mortal peril. It was fairly obvious, it seemed to him, that either
she or someone with her had been the one responsible for bringing him
here. She knew who he was AND she used his name. <I>No one</I> except
for the old man had ever called him anything other than monster,
demon, or brat… Something was up with this woman and he needed to
find what it was before something happened to him. Abruptly changing
from a blushing youngster to a cold youth, Naruto addressed the
woman. " Who the hell are you and why have you brought me here?"</p><P>Her
own attitude changing somewhat to engage the serious attitude of the
child in front of her, the woman responded. "Listen Naruto. First
things things first. One, you don't need to worry about me harming
you. Two, for right now, at least, you're safe. If I can do
anything about it, it'll remain that way. Three, who am I? Well…
we'll talk about that a little later… Right now, I need you to
calm down and listen to …"</p><P>The
woman was broken off by Naruto. " DON'T WORRY? SAFE? Are you
kidding me? How the hell am I safe? How the hell am I supposed to
trust you? I don't even know you and <I>you</I> dragged me down
into whatever place this. You expect me to just sit down calmly and
listen? You know who I am so you at least must know a little of
what I've gone through. How the hell do you expect me to be calm
and trust you when you won't even tell me your name and I don't
know what's going on! For all I know, you're just buying time for
some mob to make its way down here to …"</p><P>Naruto
found his own speech cut off by a thunderous response from the woman.</p><P>" <B>SHUT UP!"
</B>the woman looked down and to the side while sighing. " Do you
think if I wanted you dead you'd be here and now? You saw the
villagers. Do you think they looked like they wanted to wait around
for some more "fun"?" the woman looked into his eyes for a
sense of understanding. Once she found some and he calmed down
noticeably she continued on. " Listen Naruto, the fact of the
matter is…I …I didn't bring you down here. You came down here
by yourself, by your own choice."</p><P>Clearly
confused, Naruto interjected, "What are you talking about? The last
thing I remember was falling asleep after those assholes torched
everything I ever had! I think I would remember getting up and
traipsing through an army of villagers out for my head."</p><P>"Sure,
you would if you had actually moved from under the garbage" the
woman mumbled.</p><P>"That's
my point, I would've remembered moving. So either YOU or someone
ELSE brought ME here." Naruto crossed his arms in a smug manner
after having made his point.</p><P>"Naruto,
listen, this is going to sound…er...eh…strange…but…um...you're
still there. You just don't know it."</p><P>"What
are you talking about?" he exclaimed, "If I'm still there how
the hell am I here talking to you?"</p><P>"
Your mind" after having said that and seeing the blank look on the
child's face the woman decided to explain further. "We're
INSIDEyour mind." Still finding a dumbfounded expression on
Naruto's face she decided to just go ahead and give him an example.
" Naruto-kun, look at my lips." Naruto nodded and proceeded to
stare intently at her lips. The woman went ahead with her example.
"<I>Okay, see. We're inside your mind. I don't even have to use
my lips." </I>She looked to Naruto once again for understanding.
His face seemed to cock to the side for a moment as he processed the
information. His answer came out as such:</p><P>"AAAAHHHHHH!
GET OUT OF MY BRAIN! OUT OUT OUT!"</p><P>The
woman sweat-dropped as Naruto ran around outside the gates jumping up
and down shaking his head and screaming for her to get out of his
brain. ' Sure' she thought ' this is funny and all, but how is
he going to react when I tell him the rest…Oh well, best get it
over with and work from there.' She sighed once again and tried to
get Naruto's attention. "Naruto" " AHHHH, GET OUT" 
 "Naruto" "OUT OUT OUT"</p><P>"NARUTO" 
"BLAHHHHHH" <B>"NARUTO!" </B>The woman roared and brought
her now burning eyes to bear on the boy as her voice echoed through
the chamber loudly. The said boy was now paused in mid-leap with his
hands on his head with his wide eyes focused on her. "Do I have
your attention?" The boy quickly nodded and then promptly fell down
on his face.</p><P>After sweat-dropping
once again, the woman started up. "Naruto-kun, Please listen to me
and come over here." Naruto, after having picked himself up and
dusting off the dirt on his clothes, nodded and came to stand just in
front of her. Seeing that the boy was now paying her full-attention
she began.</p><P>"
It's time you learned about why those people are after you
Naruto-kun." Seeing him tense up, she took a deep breath and
continued on. "Naruto-kun, haven't you ever wondered why you're
treated the way you are? Haven't you wondered why everyone either
ignores you completely or treats you like sub-human trash? Don't
you wonder why you have no family, why you were kicked out of the
orphanage, why the only person who seems to care if you're even
alive or dead is the Hokage?" Naruto was now looking at the floor
avoiding her eyes. It was obvious to her that the subject pained him
and she was wary of what was to come, but it was necessary… She
waited patiently for any kind of response, but received none. She was
about to speak again when the small boy in front of her beat her to
the chase.</p><P>"every
moment…of everyday." The answer was honest and to the point. The
sheer bluntness of the statement hurt, but she knew it was true. She
wondered if he would say anything else. He did. "I've wondered
why it's like this every day of my life for as long as I could
remember. I knew this wasn't how it was supposed to be for a long
time, ever since the orphanage. I was the only one they treated the
way they did." Naruto's hand raised up to his face and the woman
knew he was wiping away tears.</p><P>"They
hugged all the other kids, tucked them in, even gave them kisses.
They told them that they were good, that they loved them, that
…someday they'd have a family too...but…for me, they…they
never wanted to touch me. I…I remember when I was younger they used
the hose to wash me then they'd throw me some rags and yell at me
to get to "bed". They told me I was a demon, that I didn't
deserve love, that I was a bastard mistake, and…an abomination…"</p><P>Naruto was openly sobbing at this point. "The only attention I
ever got was when they beat me…when they punished me… There…were
no kisses and hugs for me… Eventually, I began to crave the
punishment. It…I… I saw some of the other kids get punished
every now and then when it was obvious they'd do something wrong.
Too obvious for the mto blame it on me When I was punished…it...made
me feel like at least I shared something with them. It was sick, I
know it, but it was the closest thing to "affection" I got… Do
I ever wonder? You're damn right I do. Even after I was kicked out
it was the same if not worse! Those god damn mobs …and …the
torture… Wonder? I've PLEADED, I've BEGGED for someone to tell
me …….why…"</p><P>Naruto
stopped his small rant and cold, steel blue met burning, crimson red.</p><P>" And YOU are going
to tell me why? YOU are going to tell me what no one else in this
whole damn village is willing to. What even the old man won't tell
me? Someone I've never even seen before… Someone who's
apparently in MY mind? Just…just who the hell are you? How would
you know? TELL ME!"</p><P>Feeling her control
slipping somewhat, but knowing the moment of truth was at hand, the
woman in the white kimono spoke…</p><P>"Because…because…I…
I am why they hate you Naruto-kun…Because I am the source of your
suffering…Because in you, the villagers see me."</p><P>Silence reigned for a
moment while both stared into each other's eyes for some sense of
the passing emotions. In Naruto's eyes, the woman could see
confusion, anger, and disbelief for some reason? In the woman's
eyes Naruto could see sadness, regret, and…something he wasn't
quite sure about…something he'd never seen before. He'd seen
something…like it… before in the eyes of the old man, but
this…this was different…he'd only seen it in…but that was
impossible…wasn't it?</p><P>Time passed and Naruto
was the first to speak…</p><P>"What
the hell are you talking about? I don't even know YOU. This is the
first time I've ever even met you. How could you be the reason? It
doesn't make any sense. You're not around me and plus, you don't
look like the type to do something bad enough to anger that many
people. How…how could you be the reason?" He looked into her eyes
for some sense o further understanding and explanation. He was not
disappointed.</p><P>"Naruto-kun…"
She paused and took a deep breath as a tear rolled down her cheek.
"Naruto… tell me…tell me what you know about the attack of the
Kyubi seven years ago…"</p><P>Well
there goes ch.3 . I know, I know, we're still not to the meat, but
hey, I'm trying to do this right and with college test and al lthat
I have to take time to stud yand have a life and all that jazz.
…whoops. Guess I better make an amendment to my profile and add the
bit about college student. Oh well… Anyways, I hope I get some good
reviews. Flames are once again equally appreciated. Though, I'm not
receiving any surprisingly… The reason it's taking so long is
because I'm trying to build up the NaruKyubi connection. I'm also
taking the time to do a lot of technique research and planning out
the rest of the fic. I swear, eventually it'll progress
faster….maybe. 'cough' 'cough'. Anyways, I went back into
the couple 'a few reviews I had and realized I skipped arelevant
question. Sorry.</p><P>DRAGONMAN180-
The relation will expand outside of 'mind only relations'. I 
won't go into further details than that.</p><P>Alright then, till next
time.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p align="center">DISCLAIMER:
….I….DO…NOT…OWN…NARUTO….<B>UNDERSTAND? </B></p><p align="center">(But I do
own my original concepts)</p><p align="center">'never
alone'</p><p align="center">CH.4</p><P>When the woman had
asked him what he knew about Kyubi he had said 'not much'. All he
knew was that the Kyubi was the strongest of all demons and that it
had attacked Konoha. The fourth hokage, his hero, had sacrificed his
life to kill the demon and Konoha was saved. He had then asked her
what that had had to do with anything.</p><P>He had wanted answers.
Boy, did he ever get them.</p><P>Words
could not describe what Naruto was feeling. Thinking in a detached
manner once again, he considered the progress of the day's events.
The outcome was not entirely unexpected. The Conclusion: today sucked
bad….REAL bad. In a single day, he realized, his view of the world
had been utterly shattered…</p><P>The mob burning his
home and property, waking up inside some dungeon and having to wander
for hours while in mortal fear for his life, and then finally meeting
some woman that spoke to him through his thoughts….while INSIDE his
brain ALREADY, and oh yeah the best one….</p><P>He was the container of
the Nine-tail fox demon, the one that had attacked his home, Konoha,
seven years prior.</p><P>Oh and don't forget…</p><P>The woman, the one
that had seemed nice to him…and pretty to boot, the one currently
standing in front of him crying, in what he had been told was her
cage……..was the fox demon herself.</p><P>As the events circled
through his mind over and over again trying to make sense out of all
of it, one thought was prevalent…</p><P>Yep, today sucked….</p><P>1010 1010101 0101010
1010101 010101 010101010 10101 010101 0101 0101 010101 01010 1010101
01 0101001</p><P>The woman, now known
to be the demon Kyubi, looked down on Naruto as tears continued to
fall from her eyes and her features conveyed her worry for her
container. He didn't say anything to the news. In fact, his only
reaction to the information at all had been to fall flat on his butt
and to stare at her...or rather, through her, in a state of shock.
She realized it had been one hell of a shock, even more so for a
child of no more than seven years of age, but it was time he knew.
The road ahead would not be a pleasant one, but if they were both to
survive, the first steps had to be taken soon. He had to stand on his
own to feet and learn to fight for himself. The mobs were evidence
enough of that. She could only heal him so much at one time due to
the seal and the level of harm they were promising? She didn't
think she'd be able to grow back all of his limbs and digits, let
alone his brain and heart. Yes, the first steps had to be taken soon.
He just had to muster the will and strength to get up…</p><P>He was strong. She
knew this first hand…After all; she had watched him all these
years… through all the tears… and through all the torture…She'd
been there, She'd seen it, and through him, she'd felt it…</p><P>It had made <I>her</I>
want to die.</p><P>No, it wasn't the
physical pain that affected her so. It was the emotional toll.
Through out the years she had bonded with the boy. She had seen his
first steps and heard his first words. She had seen him pick himself
up and keep on going more times than she could count. She saw the
unwavering honesty and integrity of character the boy possessed, the
will to survive by his <I>OWN </I>way regardless of the world, and
his deepest desire to receive acknowledgment. Even to demons, such
traits were rare at so young an age. She didn't feel like his
mother and she certainly didn't feel like his sister, but there was
certainly a feeling there. It was <I>that</I> feeling that made her
want to die…</p><P>It hadn't always been
that way. In the beginning, when she first understood what had
happened, she was angry. <I>VERY ANGRY </I>. Her vengeance on the
arrogant ninjas had not only been stopped short, SHE'D been sealed!
Into a human child of all things! Her power was trapped along with
her form inside the prison of a babe… Despite her fury and blows
against her prison she was trapped…</p><P>All she could do was
sit back and observe…</p><P>With time, her
perception changed. She came to understand the humans and realized
that while she had been just in attempting to destroy the one that
had committed an atrocity in order to gain the power and favor of a
nine-tail lord, she had been entirely wrong in trying to massacre the
village that he escaped into…</p><P>The first year of the
child's life, by then she had learned his name was Naruto, was not
entirely unpleasant. The time spent under the care of the Hokage was…
enlightening. It was what had changed her opinion of the village. The
Hokage was a wise and noble leader. He cared for his village and
often spoke to Naruto. She appreciated the fact that he addressed
Naruto not as herself but as his own being. The same could not be
said for most of the others that came around the boy. Regardless, she
learned what it meant to be shinobi from listening to the human and
for that she was thankful.</p><P>Thereafter, however,
her opinion of the village began to change back… With the coming of
the orphanage incidents and the subsequent atrocities involved with
torture and abuse in the village, she had vowed to reduce Konoha to
ashes for the crimes against Naruto. Even her begrudging respect for
the old man would not stop her…</p><P>What did change her
mind was Naruto.</p><P>' I WILL BECOME
HOKAGE AND THEY WILL HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ME!' had been his words.
The Kyubi reconsidered her position and made a new vow…She would
help Naruto…It was the least she could do for him…</p><P>Yes, he'd been put
through a hell that few demons, let alone humans, had ever had the
misfortune to suffer in and yet he had persevered, if not thrived.
Rather than drown in sorrow entirely, focus on revenge, or just lose
himself to insanity…her had carried on. He had chosen his own path
against all odds. To earn the love and respect of those that would
wish him death. Naruto…Naruto was strong. She knew for a fact…</p><P>He'd make it.</p><P>She'd make sure of
it.</p><P>But still, the absence
of what might seem like a normal reaction was disturbing….'Perhaps'
she thought 'I should try and get through to him inside his
thoughts'.</p><P>10101 010101 0101010
1010101 0101010 10101010 10101 010101 0101 0101 01010 101010 1010 101
01 010 1001</p><P>Naruto felt a slight
tugging at his mind and realized it was the fox woman trying to
communicate with him. Finally coming back into control of his
faculties, he brought his now cold eyes up and bored into the Kyubi's
own.</p><P>Seeing she had his
attention, she gathered her wits and began to speak. " Naruto…I…I'm
so sorry. I… never meant for all of this to happen to you. If…If
I had known… I…" She was interrupted mid-speech by Naruto.</p><P>"YOU…YOU… YOU'RE
SORRY?...YOU'RE SORRY?" Taking the time to glare as hard as he
could directly into the eyes of the demon, the cause of his
suffering, Naruto continued on while screaming. "YOU'RE SORRY!
YOU WRECKED MY ENTIRE LIFE AND YOU'RE JUST SORRY!" Shaking and
heaving as the tears fell down from his eyes to the floor , Naruto
took one large gasp of air and began again. "You…you're sorry…?
My whole life…for NOTHING...and you...you're sorry?" Falling
back on the ground, now completely sprawled out, Naruto lay quiet as
his chest heaved up and down. Silent tears streaked past his cheeks
as he stared at the ceiling. Silence reigned for minutes only to be
broken once again by Naruto….</p><P>"My whole
life…I…thought…that I…that I had done something wrong.
Something I couldn't remember, but something bad. My whole life
I've thought that it's been my fault …that maybe I deserved it
somehow…maybe in even a little way, but…but I was wrong."
Naruto breathed in deeply and then cried out. "IT WASN'T EVEN MY
DAMN FAULT AND THEY KNEW!" his breathing easing, the next few
words came out as whispers. "They knew…the whole time ...and
they still didn't care….' A few more moments passed. The
demoness was considering things to say, but what could you say when
you were the cause of such a life… She was saved with another
question. "why?"</p><P>Thinking that he was
referring to his last statements, she responded in a tired manner.
"It's because of what I said before. In you they see me. The
truth, the fact you have always been nothing more than an innocent,
means nothing to them. My…my attack was …not merciful. I did many
things that now…now I would never do. The fact is, they lost much
and with out some outlet of vengeance they would lose their
minds…you…you became their scapegoat. The source of all their
ills. For their suffering at my hand as well as all that
followed…..Naruto…I…I am truly sorry."</p><P>"No." Naruto stated
firmly</p><P>Sadly, seeing the boy's
hesitation to accept such a cruelty in life, Kyubi spoke. "No,
I...am sorry Naruto. It is hard to understand, it's a harsh reality
to face, but you have to under…"</p><P>"NO,I meant why did
you attack?" Naruto asked aggressively sitting up and facing the
woman, desperately seeking for any new ways to understand the
situation.</p><P>For once, the fox demon
found herself at a lost. She had not thought he would even care to
ask for her reasons till he had been aware of her for quit awhile.
Considering her choices and the knowledge at hand, she decided to
inquire about is train of thought. "What, what do you mean Naruto?
Why do you want to know why I attacked? I thought, I thought you'd
be so angry you wouldn't even speak to me for ages…"</p><P>Naruto's eyes
darkened considerabley as he spoke." Who said I'm not angry?
You're a demon. You attacked my village. You ruined my life on all
levels and have made everyone in my village loathe my as they would a
devil. Angry? I way past that…but…" Naruto trailed off as his
eyes softened into a sad spaced look.</p><P>"but?" the demoness
asked somewhat wary from his earlier words but also somewhat…hopeful?</p><P>"your eyes…"
Naruto said.</p><P>"What…what about my
eyes?" the fox demon responded uncertainly. She was fully aware
that her demonic visage, human form or not , disturbed many.
'Especially my eyes' she thought to herself. Somehow, the glowing
crimson orbs she possessed made others naturally uneasy. In a battle
it was great, the fear they could cause when utilized properly was
amazing, <I> but</I> in normal conversation …they…'limited'
her. Afterall, they're failry obvious, fairly unique…what with
the slit that showed up every now and then, and most importantly, a
tell tale sign of her demonic power. She could only wonder what he
saw in them and so she waited…</p><P>"I can see the pain
in them…when…when you said you were sorry for all that you've
done. I … I don't want to believe you…but your…your eyes,
they're different, but …they're the same as mine. I can see the
loneliness …and sorrow…most of all though…I see
regret…so…please…please just tell me why so I can undertand.
You… you don't seem like the bloodthirsty killer I've seen
pictures and heard stories about before…Earlier…when we first
met…you…you could've attacked me when I was sitting against
that gate there. You could've killed me then and there, but you
didn't. From what I understand about the seal and from what you
told me about it…if you had killed me, you would be in control of
my body….once again…I …I need to know why you did it. I need to
understand….please…" Finishing, Naruto stood and approached the
gates. Coming to a stop, he put his hands on the bars and came close
toward the Kyubi. He pleaded once more as the woman looked down and
stayed silent. "please…"</p><P>Now caught completely
and utterly off-guard, the Kybui just didn't know how to respond.
It was the truth, yes. She could've killed him. Could've taken
over when he neared…but she didn't. She could never do that to
him…She looked down into his expectant eyes and saw a desperate
desire for knowledge and understanding. Considering his words, she
realized that even she on occasion was surprised by his maturity and
strength of heart. Even through the shock and anger he was able to
see that which was true before him…Taking a breath, she prepared
herself for to tell a long story, a story of the beginning, of demon
lords and clans long gone, of alliances and conflicts from an era
gone by, of the death of her heart, of the passage of time, of the
discovery of an atrocity, and finally of a final choice and its
consequences for them both." Naruto-kun" she said," Take a
seat, this is going to take awhile…"</p><P>100101010101010 0101010

0101010 01010</p><P>whooo, that took a lot
to write for me. I tried very hard to try and come up with a
compelling emotional scene. To be quite honest, it's hard trying to
get this to work. The honest point is that a mother/son relationship
is far more likely under the said circumstances than what I'm
trying to write, but by the end of the next chapter it ought to work
out fine. I'm happy that I've received some good reviews here and
there. I got my first flame too (yippee) though it wasn't for this
fic. It was for my little one-shot. I'll admit, the one-shot is
horrible, but I was just writing for the sake of writing why
listening to some music and it let me practice going through some
motions. I might go back and redo it sometime. Anyways, back to this
fic. Like I said earlier. I want it done right. SOOOO, it might take
awhile. Good things come to those who wait, right? Well, in closing
on my A/N for this chap I'll just say that I don't think I got
any answerable questions….so..no question answering this
one.yeah..I bet THAT sounded real smart. (smacks self upside head).
Alright, well, my consciousness is starting to give out. Time for

this one even gets a name "HISTORY OF THE KYUBIS"</p><P>Taking a few moments to
collect her thoughts, the fox woman known as the Kyubi, the nine-tail
demon terror of konoha began her story…</p><P>"I …suppose…to
fully understand what happened. I'll have to tell you about it all
from the beginning." The woman murmured, reliving memories as she
spoke.</p><P>"The beginning of
your attack?" Naruto asked with a grim interest.</p><P>After a moment, the
woman noticed Naruto had asked her something and thought back to
answer. " No Naruto, from the beginning of MY life." Seeing
Naruto's confused nature she clarified. "Listen , for you to
really understand...why...I acted the way I did you're going to
have to hear the… whole… story."</p><P>Naruto gave a simple
"Hn" in response and the demoness began again.</p><P>"None of us are sure 
exactly how we all came to be, even the ancients of my kind never
knew the whole truth as to how the world was created …but… this
much is known. At first, there was chaos, nothingness as it were…and
then, two worlds were created. The world of the demons, mine, and
yours, the world of mankind. Each was separated and at the time
neither knew of the other's existence….… In my own world, the
powers of demon kind grew to unprecedented levels and nothing seemed
to stand in our way. Great clans of demons formed and battles raged
across the demon realm for supremacy and control while all along the
land was ravaged. Left to its own devices, your own world remained
ignorant of these happenings and remained peaceful and untouched…
In time though that changed….With the power of many clans finally
becoming permanent, the different factions finally took the time to
look at what they had to rule... and…the truth finally came to
them. In their quest for power and dominance, they had destroyed our
land…our world…Only a few territories were left in relatively
fair condition and there was little doubt that further conflict would
find its way there soon…"</p><P>Taking time to breathe
in and consider her next words, the Kyubi continued…</p><P>"For the now ancient
lords of the demon realm, this was… unacceptable. Many began
researching in their power the means by which to travel into other
realms…first, they developed techniques to try and rip through
dimensional rifts and see into other planes. They succeeded…. and
…eventually…" the Kyubi sighed "eventually, they found a way
to see into your world…a perfect, ripe world filled with only a few
weakened beings called 'humans'…" the Kyubi chuckled in a
dark and mocking manner and seeing Naruto's disturbed confusion
explained "It was the first thing all the demon clans ever worked
on together. Success, even for those old fools, was only a matter of
time…With their work completed; the greatest of the clans gathered
all together along with their kin and, by using their combined powers
and a new terrifying ability discovered by the Ookami, they opened a
rift between the worlds… In that single, moment the history of your
world changed forever…"</p><P>At this point the Kyubi
became angry and slammed her two fists against the cage's bars a
small distance down form where Naruto sat and yelled out with an
angry voice. "Do you know what those damn fools did once they came
here? Do you know what the greatest and 'most powerful' demon
lords did the moment they got here? THEY STARTED THE DAMN WARS ALL
OVER AGAIN! THEY WERE GOING TO REPEAT THE WHOLE THING!"</p><P>Seething, the Kyubi
halted her speech and took a moment to calm her self… "They
started the same damn war all over again…the fools. It was bad
enough that most of the demon realm was laid to ruins, but now they
were going to repeat it all over again… They didn't even care the
least bit about the life already here, your people…It was insane…it
was unacceptable and so…we, the younger lords, rebelled against
those that came before us in the moment of their weakness. We were
younger, we were stronger, and even at their peak they were never our
equals…"</p><P>A small smile made its
way to the fox woman's face as she recalled the victory over the
lords of old and the discovery of new friends…"After the civil
war, the clans each came under new leadership…Eventually, four
factions came out of the chaos. The lead faction, and the most
powerful was led by Seigi, the nine-tailed wolf, the Kyubi no Ookami.
Seigi…" the remaining Kyubi paused as happy memories passed by in
her mind…" Seigi, was a brave and noble demon lord. He believed
in justice and equality among the tribes. That's probably why he
attracted the oddest following. Within his army were the wolves, the
dogs, the birds, and frogs!" the demoness was openly laughing at
this point "FROGS AND BIRDS…TOGETHER! I mean honestly, who the
hell…." The Kyubi trailed off as she observed a still grim and
serious Naruto lacking both humor and understanding….'cough '…
" Never mind…" she murmured. "The important thing to know…is
that Seigi…Seigi had a gift. He could bring anyone together…He
had such an energy, such a zeal, and his power…oh…did he have
power…. He made you think anything was possible. Really,
Naruto-kun, you may not know it, but you remind me a lot of him…"</p><P>The Kyubi trailed off
while lost in thought, but then collected herself. "After Seigi,
was Dento…Dento…was a bit more…different than the rest of us.
Most of us were against many of the old traditions and all. We were
there to carve out a new destiny for our peoples, a new way, but
Dento…Dento was the definition of a 'stick in the mud'. To say
he was hung up on tradition is an understatement. Still, it didn't
matter that much to us. Other than a few things he'd be fanatical
about here and then, he was usually flexible for those outside his
sphere of influence…which was quite small by the way. Dento was the
nine-tailed dragon lord, the Kyubi no Ryu. His dominion consisted
only of his own dragons and the snakes. There were also a few other
minor serpent clans that had minimal distinctions, but they usually
just hailed Dento as their lord… When it came down to it…Dento…he
was a reliable friend and leader. He tried to rule fairly within his
sphere and maintain order…though...none of the rest of us ever
figured out how in the hell he ever got Manda to do anything. We
figured he just kind of let things go the way they would around him…
Damn, lazy, evil, conniviving snake…son of a…well, on to the
other one…the REAL bastard…"</p><P>The Kyubi's anger
rose to new heights as she remembered the last other nine-tail lord,
the Kyubi no Sasori. Gritting her teeth, she spat out his name…"
Uragiri… the bastard's name was Uragiri… We… we knew he was
evil from the beginning…but…he...was powerful…powerful as of
the rest of us at the time, and we needed him and his forces to gain
control of the human realm and create some sense of order… We
allowed him into our ranks…and…we paid for it later dearly…"
having vented some anger, the Kybui allowed a deep breath to leave
her lungs and shook her head as she recalled his empire. " Uragiri,
was an evil one all right. Cunning, devious, sly…you name it. He
was smart, VERY smart, and this is coming from me, the Queen, Lord,
and leader of the Kitsune, the demon foxes, masters of trickery…He
was also very cruel, but…I suppose that was a given considering who
and what he was. I can't exactly imagine a nine-tailed scorpion
being exactly trustworthy let alone friendly. Like I said before, I
can understand to a point… I guess I'd have to be like that too
if I was high lord of the mantis, spiders, slugs, and scorpions. It's
not exactly a supportive group. Hell, two of the clans often eat
their own mates and that's freakish even for demons!" seeing
Naruto's now bug-eyed expression and the fact that he was slightly
scooting away from the gate she shouted " HEY I SAID THAT WAS
NORMAL FOR THEM. TO THE REST OF US THEY'RE FREAKS!" Seeing that
Naruto stopped his escape…but didn't move back she continued on.
" Now, 'ahem' , As I said, Uragiri was a cruel and evil one, he
kept a lot to himself, which was probably for the best. If we had
known more about him we probably would've gone back to war" …not
that it mattered for long anyways she added on silently to herself. "
What we did know was that he was the most power hungry out of the
four of us… That's why he joined up in the effort. He wanted to
see how we obtained our powers as nine-tails and to see if it was
possible to reach beyond the limits of a demon's existence. A
nearly endless lifespan and power beyond human comprehension wasn't
enough for him…he had to have more…to know more….but we didn't
care. Seigi thought that as long as the three of us could check his
power that we would be alright…Seigi…thought he could be relied
upon to a certain extent…Like I said earlier, we needed his power
and influence…so he joined."</p><P>Pacing around while
cracking her neck, The Kyubi no Kitzune spoke. " And…that's how
we came to be known as the four Kyubis…High demon lords of the
human realm… Having gained control of the realm, we established
order and divied up the territory into four different areas. North,
South, East, and West. To maintain our balance, each fraction had its
closest partner placed across from them. Seigi and…"</p><P>The fox woman was cut
off by Naruto in mid speech. " WAIT, what's your name?"</p><P>The demoness responded
quickly. " <I>My</I> name? I thought it would be obvious, I am the
Kyubi no Kitsune, the nine-tailed fox."</p><P>"NO" Naruto stated
exasperatedly " What's your <I>name</I> not your <I>title</I>!
All the others had a name besides which type of Kyubi they were.
What's your name? Now that I know it's just some sort of demon
title I want your real name."</p><P>Noticing the prior
seriousness was momentarily gone from Naruto, she decided to try him
a little." Why should I tell you? For a demon to give their name
openly is an honor, besides, you ought to have some measure of
respect for me. I mean, come on, in my world I was the equivalent of
your hokage." The Kyubi no Kitsune responded with no small degree
of smugness stressed in her voice.</p><P>"Oh come on, I don't
even do that for the old man." He retorted.</p><P>"You should." the
fox woman replied curtly.</p><P>"Come OOOOONNNN"
Naruto whined in a pleading manner with his previous grim state now
nearly forgotten.</p><P>"I…I don't want
to…" the woman stated…while looking down and to the side with a
slight blush on her face.</p><P>"What…why?"
Naruto asked, now extremely interested.</p><P>"Because…you'll
make fun of it… All the others did…" she asserted while
mumbling…</p><P>"What? No I won't I
promise!" he insisted.</p><P>"Promise?" she
waited for a moment to see him nod his head in confirmation. "
Okay, its…it's…Warai"</p><P>Silence dominated the
chamber for several moments only to be broken. First by the sounds of
snickering and then by light laughter.</p><P>"<B>DAMN IT NARUTO</B>!
<B>YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T LAUGH !" </B>roared the Kyubi no
Kitsune now embarrassed and extremely angry.</p><P>"And I still haven't"
chuckled the blond haired youth. " At least not at you that is…It's
just.."</p><P>"JUST WHAT?" the
demoness harshly cut-off.</p><P>" It's just that it
figures such a pretty name would go with an equally pretty woman."</p><P>"WHAT DO YOU Mean…?"
The fox woman trailed off, losing her anger.</p><P>"What's more
beautiful than laughter? I know for a fact from the few times I've
ever really laughed how wonderful it was…It… makes you feel
…full… inside….kind of…complete. I think it's a great
name…."</p><P>Naruto continued on for
a few moments commenting on her name totally unawares of the effect
his words had on her. 'oh Naruto-kun...' ran through the woman's
mind.' You'll be something special when you're older. That's
for sure'. Coming back to her senses, the demoness just managed to
catch Naruto's last words about continuing her story…</p><P>"So anyway, I think
it's a nice name …Warai…but seriously.." Naruto's face
returned to a measure of his previous grim stature. "What the hell
happened? I got it that you're one of these Kybui lords, but what
the hell does that have to do with Konoha? You still haven't
explained what the connection is."</p><P>Her smile fading, the
Kyubi no Kitsune, now known as Warai, responded. " I…I'm
getting there Naruto…It's just it's…been a long time since
I've talked to anyone…let alone about what happened…In fact,
you…you'll be the first to know what fully happened. So…just…just
give me some time…"</p><P>Warai took yet another
deep breath as memories…now...sad ones flushed past her. "As I
was saying before, We were placed opposite our closest ally. For
myself, I was the Southern Lord in control of the Tanuki, bears, and
foxes. Seigi claimed the high throne as the northern lord while
Uragiri controlled the west and Dento ruled the East…That's
basically how things worked for…a long time. We each had our own
way of running things, but there were a few common laws we held
amongst ourselves to protect the life and land that was here before
our arrival. The most important law was the mandate of
guardianship…which…<I>basically</I>…meant that the demons that
reigned over an area were responsible for the humans living there."
Warai chuckled once again… though this time it was as if a funny
joke had just been played on someone close by. "I can tell you
personally that nearly all of the demon clans <I>HATED</I> that law
at first. I mean, really, we were forcing them to treat you humans in
a way that was unthinkable for many demons. Many demons didn't even
consider other types of demons their equals…let alone humans…but"
Warai's eyes once again softened "Seigi…could be…very…
<I>persuasive</I>. He was very determined that we wouldn't abandon
those who lived here before us and it was his clan ,the Ookami, who
had discovered the secret to the rift and he was able to use the
threat of a return trip more than once. HA HA ha..the looks on their
HA HA hah AHAH." Obviously, Warai was now roaring in laughter at
the memory.</p><P>Gathering her wits once
again and wiping a tear of laughter from her eye she began anew.
"Yes, at first they were reluctant to say the least…but, we were
able to force the clans to obey the law. Afterall, if they weren't
persuaded by the power of Seigi alone…which was stupid in the first
place… they were quickly silenced by the combined might of the four
lords…It..It was like that for many a year, but eventually…
eventually things began to get better, Just like Seigi said they
would…"</p><P>Making eye contact with
Naruto she carried on. "Your civilization began to thrive under
the hand of the demon lords and eventually nearly all of the clans
grew to respect their human neighbors to some extent. Eventually,
they even taught your kind the demonic arts of energy manipulation
and physical combat, but of course, you call it ninjustu and
taijustu…"</p><P>"WHAT?" Naruto
cried out while amazed by the new information.</p><P>"Yes Naruto-kun, it
was my kind, the demons who taught your people the initial ways in
which to wield their physical and spiritual energy…. Though, now,
your means are much, much different from our own."</p><P>Curious, Naruto
questioned the fox woman. "What do you mean? Do demons not use hand
seals?"</p><P>"Naruto-kun, it's a
little hard to use hand seals the way you humans do when you don't
have hands," she replied. Seeing the confusion she once again
explained further. " Naruto-kun, right now, I'm in my human form,
but whenever serious battle came around I transformed into my full
demonic state. Remember the stories about the four to five story tall
demon? That's how large I can become…though it is adjustable. "
Seeing an 'oh' look come across his face she continued. " BUT
that's not to say we never used hand seals at all…we just didn't
use as many. In fact, traditionally, we only used one and that was
while in our human forms. Typically, that was our clan seal or
rather…our animal type and even then it was only used to focus our
unique energies for our specific clan techniques… I mean, really,
didn't you humans ever wonder why all of your seals correlated to
demons? Come on, when was the last time you saw a dragon? I thought
they would've figured it out…but no, they just think it's the
zodiac. How sad…"</p><P>"But wait, how come
there's no fox, wolf, or scorpion seal? " Naruto asked.</p><P>"That's because our
clans never revealed our focusing techniques to you humans. Though, I
imagine, if we had, you would now have some rather amazing
ninjutsus." Warai stated.</p><P>Perplexed, Naruto
confronted her. "What makes you say that?"</p><P>" Naruto-kun, you've
got a great dream, but you really ought to be a little more
perceptive about your environment if you want to achieve it... Don't
you know what the most powerful elemental ninjutsu attacks are?"
seeing the 'duh huh?' look on Naruto's face she sighed.
"They're the elemental dragon attacks Naruto-kun. Your most
powerful elemental attacks are the ones originating from the line of
the demon dragon clan techniques…." Shaking her head with a smirk
she continued "I have to admit, I never even thought you humans
would advance this far in energy manipulation. Granted, I thought you
had some potential, but I never thought you could make it this
far…only Seigi did…" seeing the same clue less expression as
before, Warai made a mental note to share her ancient history with
the Hokage some where down the line…It was getting tiresome
explaining it this time and she didn't want to have to do it again…
"Listen, the reason I said that is this…my people, demons…we
have huge stores of charka which we freely flow within and around us
in order to achieve our desired results. Experience with that makes
us masters of charka manipulation…while you humans...you kind of
'control' it externally and waste it. When we use our clan seals,
we're focusing our specific types of clan energy. Considering that
each demon clan had a different type of technique that they mastered,
we each had a different seal, and the seals focused on a different
type of energy. Apparently, you humans wizened up to that fact and
discovered that by combining the focusing techniques of multiple
clans you could recreate advanced demonic techniques…or
rather…imitations of them. For beings that have such a short
lifespan and relatively limited amounts of chakra that's really
amazing…." Warai smiled at Naruto-kun and thought in the back of
her mind. 'Yes, Naruto-kun. Humans have a great potential and I'll
make sure you reach your peak…'</p><P>"Wow, I never knew
any of that…" Naruto expelled in amazement.</p><P>"Well, almost no one
else does Naruto…" she replied while enjoying the look of
Naruto's wowed state.</p><P>"But…how come none
of the other Kyubi clans revealed their techniques to humans? Did you
all not have direct control over humans and that's why or what? Did
you not want the humans to learn your powers?" Naruto proposed.</p><P>At Naruto's question,
both Warai's tone and demeanor darkened considerably. " No..no
Naruto. It …it wasn't that we didn't want to it was …more
that we couldn't …or rather, that we weren't supposed to…"</p><P>"I don't
understand…" said Naruto.</p><P>"I wouldn't expect
you too…that's...that's why I'm telling you this story in the
first place…" Warai rebuked to a now silent Naruto. "As I was
saying…after getting used to the laws and having humans around for
a few generations or so, they took it upon themselves to train them
and show them how use their own powers. For awhile it was just to be
able to guard themselves… None of us saw any problem with it. It
improved trust, understanding , and relations amongst humans and
demons but eventually…things took a turn for the worse…"
Warai's eyes darkened and she looked down once more as she spoke.
"The laws…the terms of guardianship had many rules …that…we
agreed to. Some of these laws were proposed by Seigi and I while the
others….the others were proposed by Dento and Uragiri…We looked
them over and agreed…we…never thought that what we had agreed to
could be twisted in such a way…" Warai lay silent for a moment
before beginning again. "It was the humans underneath Uragiri's
clans that first attacked the other territories…We… we moved to
stop them, but Uragiri showed up and played his hand along with the
other lords…the laws... the laws they said… stated that the
demons were the guardians of the humans to which they were allotted
to both by territory and by people. Where their people went…so did
they. To that extent, their power and influence were defined by the
humans they reigned over. To preserve a somewhat normal society for
the humans, it was also decided that demons were not to interfere
within interhuman affairs….With that knowledge, Uragiri had planned
a power play by amassing an army of trained humans…" gritting her
teeth Warai finished her statement. "Wherever they went of their
'own affairs'…so did he and his his realm of control."</p><P>Warai had paused to
collect a few breaths before beginning again when Naruto spoke. "What
happened?"</p><P>Warai's response was
simple and to the point. "…war…" Turning around and bracing
her back against the bars of the cage, she slid down and sat on the
ground. "War happened Naruto-kun…. It seemed like everything we'd
worked for was going down the drain all over again…It was even
worse this time though…the humans… whole families and cities were
being slaughtered and….their guardians…the ones they had looked
to for help and protection were…helpless to do anything about it…If
we intervened though… an even worse war would come about…the best
we could do was to train our own forces…which we did. It wasn't
long after that each Kyubi had their own camp to run…essentially,
this is where the ninja and the hidden village was born…." Warai
didn't even need to look up and see the shocked expression on
Naruto's face to know it was there. "Yes, we were rather
surprised things turned out the way they did as well…"</p><P>"Well I don't get
it then…if the Kyubi no Ryu was able to reveal his clan seal and
techniques why couldn't the others? I think it would've made a
lot of sense then especially. I mean, you can only do so much with
one hand seal." Naruto questioned.</p><P>"It's like I said
before, Naruto, we the Kyubi were not allowed to teach any of our
techniques to the humans…Humans didn't get the dragon seal
because Dento taught it to them. They got it …because……well…that
comes later…" Warai lifted her hand into the air and used to it
to twirl her red hair strands amongst her fingers. "The important
thing to know is that the forces devolved into armed camps and
eventually the combined powers of both the northern and southern
human tribes were able to force them back…After that though…things
never really settled down. Each passing generation of your kind grew
more and more skilled as they remained in close proximity to the
demons…In fact…" Warai now stood, popped her back, turned
around and looked directly at Naruto. "They became so used to each
other, so close, and so trusting…that they started doing something 
that no one thought any demon would bring himself to do…" Seeing
the now truly curious look on Naruto's face, she smiled and told
him. " They interbred."</p><P>"WHAT! How is that
even possible? I thought your human form was just some illusion?"
Shrieked the now confused Naruto.</p><P>"No,no,no Naruto-kun,
you misunderstand…my human form, what you see now, is very real…but
so is my full demon form…They're just something I can interchange
in between….Now as for interbreeding…well…yes, some of us were
quite shocked as well…then again… others were horrified. If there
was ever a thing that broke with tradition with regards to demon
clans it was interbreeding. Before, there was practically no
tolerance whatsoever even for a different demon type coupling with
another…but humans…no, many just couldn't and WOULDN'T accept
that."</p><P>After sighing Warai
continued. " Among us high lords though, it didn't matter all
that much…well except for Dento of course…but both Seigi and
Uragiri thought it could improve things…On Seigi's part he
thought it could bring together a greater sense of unity in the
realm…and on Uragiri's side…well…whatever made his forces
stronger was a plus…Of course, he felt cheated later…I mean,
really, one was big enough of a shock, but to actually see the demon
clans then claim the offspring as their own? And then add to that the
fact that once they became clan members then THEIR family was also
considered clan members…well, you can probably put two and two
together… That's basically how the wars ended…with the birth of
what your kind now call 'bloodline-limits' ….and don't even
looked shocked Naruto. Can you honestly say you didn't see it
coming…I mean really, I don't know how your whole race just up
and forget their history…it's pitiful…Anyways, as I said , that
basically ended the wars…the confrontations couldn't occur
anymore because now we, the Kyubi's could step in…after all, clan
business was OUR business… "</p><P>Pacing in her cage, the
fox woman became saddened in her tone. "We thought that we had
restored balance once again…that maybe…given enough time, even
Dento would cave in on the old ways and we could find some measure of
lasting peace…that we had finally ceased the scheming of Uragiri
and that things, while not perfect, were good. Civilization was on
the upstart again, and even whole clans of hanyou families were
forming and coming together here and there…Yes. Things were
good…and they stayed as such until Seigi did something that no one
even thought was possible, that <I>defied </I>the laws of nature as
far as demons were concerned…"</p><P>"Pshht, What could
top creating a rift in between dimensions?" Naruto asked flatly.</p><P>"A lot." Was
Warai's simple and serious reply. " Naruto-kun, the Ookami , the
demon wolves, merely altered an advanced clan technique and poured in
a lot of power to rip open the gateway that all the clans used to
enter to this realm. What Seigi did was comparable to <I>creating</I>
a realm…"</p><P>Intersted in the
greater demon lord, Naruto asked a question. "Woah, what did he
do?"</p><P>"He became the first
and only ten-tail." Was her reply. Waiting for a reaction Warai
sighed and made ANOTHER mental note. 'Scratch talking to the Kage,
never tell this story again. It takes too long…' "Naruto-kun,
each living being has a set number of gates. These gates are
essentially the locked pathways to their inner absolute power and
capacity…for humans, this number is eight. No matter how powerful
you become, even if you have a bloodline limit and are of demon
origin, you can only call upon eight of those gates and even then
only seven if you don't wish to die. That's also, Naruto-kun, why
they're called bloodline- LIMITS…and as far as marking your
strength goes, there's no real change in your appearance to show
the level you can reach…For demons it's different. We, by design,
have nine gates. Usually, we can only call upon eight full gates at
normal and the ninth if we would risk our eternal existence…In
status, our tails denote the level of mastery we wield over our own
powers…For us, the Kyubis, our nine tails were proof of the fact
that we had ventured beyond normal limits and successfully braved the
ninth gate…Such a feat is only possible by the most inherently
powerful demons…us…but Seigi…he trumped us all one. We had
known he was strong, hell, we had even known he was the strongest
among our number, but we never knew his absolute depths until he had
done it."</p><P>"Done what?" was
Naruto's simple question.</p><P>"Arghhh, weren't
you listening when I told you he became the first ten-tail?" she
cried.</p><P>Seeig his now annoying
'duh huh?' look she barged on. "Fine, oh god, I'll spell it
out for you… demons don't have a tenth gate! Seigi MADE one. He
literally was able to wield his power and ability to the point that
he was able to focus in upon the very fabric of his soul and body and
create a tent gate and portal to power…Hell, even I'm not sure
how he did it…The best I can guess it was more of his clan's
techniques…focused energies and gateways and such…." Warai
explained. "BUT what's even more important than that was the fact
that it sent one demon lord right off his rocker…"</p><P>"Uragiri…" Naruto
muttered.</p><P>"Correct Naruto-kun…"
Warai commented in a vicious tone with regards to the scorpion demon.
"If there was anything that pissed that scorpion off it was the
knowledge that there was a being out there of equal or superior
power to him…While we were all nine-tails he could stroke his ego
and rest easy knowing that he had as much a chance in battle as the
rest of us… but now that comfort was gone and Seigi clearly had an
advantage over the rest of us…Where as we could risk tapping the
ninth gate for power in a struggle, HE could actively use it now
without fear…and THAT knowledge was what constituted the substance
of what pissed Uragiri off the most: fear. He loathed it…or rather,
to feel it that is. He got a kick out of dishing it out, but reviled
it in return…Anyways, what's once again important is the
knowledge that he set out to rectify that problem… and find a way,
a weakness, as it were with Seigi… and… the… means… by which
to destroy him…"</p><P>Now wary of a Warai in
tears, Naruto stuttered out a question." D..Did he find it….?"</p><P>Once again sitting with
her back to the bars, Warai summoned the strength to answer and
continue on. Past sobs and struggles she answered.</p><P>"…yes…"</p><P>100010010001 0101010
0101010101010 010101001 01010101 010101010 010101010 01010101 0101010
101001</p><P>Whooo boy, that was a
long one….my fingers are practically bleeding on the keyboard
(insert sarcasm). Seriously though, I had an outline of the history
and when I finally got down to writing it I found a surprisingly
detailed sotry in the back of my brain….and here it is. TA-DA. I'm
looking forward to getting the time to finish this intro arc and
getting into the real meat and potatoes of this fic soon. I suppose
it'll be one more ending chapter for the downfall of the demon age,
and the escape from the mad villagers…after that will be a little
filler of sorts with some skill oriented sequences… an then a
lovely breakdancing sequence that will be twenty pages long. Ha ha
ha, just kidding 'peers into soul of reader' or am
I?...yes I am.</p><P>Anywho, to address one
disturbing post. No, there was no implied rape of Naruto. Let me
spell it out for you. Broken fingers, stabs, burns, acids , etc…and
as for the Hokage and Anbu… They could only do so much with the
staff on hand and the politival environment. Come on, the Kyubi was
like an atom bomb on Konoha (dramatized for metaphorical puposes) and
the council as well as the general populace were not exactly in a
forgiving mood. Once again, as for the Hokage, he needed to see about
repairing the village's infrastructure and heart. To do that, he
needed to have the heart of the people. There's no way (I think) he
could've really done that if he was close to Naruto. They just
would've said he was being controlled by the boy…..BUT don't
worry. Something concerning the villagers will show up in a little
while…</p><P>WELLZ, thanks again for
the reviews and flames. Madnarutofan is….OUT.</p><P>NEXT TIME: The End of

 / ………… / ……….. /
…………. / …………. / ………..</p><P>Silence reigned as
Naruto sat in contemplation of Warai's affirmation and now wholly
caught up in the tale; he chose to press for answers…. "
Warai...wh..what happened?"</p><P>" From….from what
we learned …..Afterwards…" Warai paused while obviously
reliving painful memories. "In…in… the initial stages of his
coup….Uragiri had approached Dento and his clans about joining
forces and crushing Seigi. He argued that with Seigi's new power it
would only be a matter of time before he would try and take over the
other territories…that to preserve the power and dignity of the Ryu
he had to put him down….It…it was a compelling argument ….but…it
didn't work out. Dento…Dento was just as wary as I about Seigi's
new power… the balance of power had been broken and… if he had
wished… we knew he could probably conquer us….BUT…but he also
knew Seigi personally just as I did…….. that he was trustworthy,
honorable, and a friend… that he believed in justice and never once
had he attacked out of aggression …….Dento knew as did I that,
yes, he was powerful….but no…he was not a threat… With that in
mind he …turned down Uragiri…"</p><P>"...so Dento <I>didn't</I>
help the scorpion?" asked Naruto.</p><P>Not receiving an answer
for quite some time, Naruto crawled towards the gate and put his arm
on Warai's kimono covered shoulder. "Warai?"</p><P>"…no…" she
whispered. "…not at first…but…som..something came up…"
Naruto was about to ask what happened once again when she lifted her
chin and, while looking into his eyes, continued. "Uragiri…had
been furious when Dento turned him down….he knew that with nothing
more than the power of his own forces against Seigi's, victory was
impossible……..so…he schemed on how to turn Dento against 
him……..He…he tried a few measly plans here and there…but
nothing ever stuck……Dento just wouldn't buy it…" Warai
paused to look away and stare into the black of her cage. "Eventually
he gathered that if it he was going to sway Dento and his clans he'd
need to find it in the one point that neither Seigi nor I could ever
sway Dento, a topic with which he was fanatical…….he would have
to find …something… that had to do with the breaking of clan law
and contracts…more specifically…something that had to do with
interbreeding…'</p><P>"but wait…I thought
you said it ended the war… didn't that mean Dento's clan and
the snakes and serpents interbred as well?" Naruto questioned.</p><P>"Them?" She replied
in a tired and sarcastic manner with one eye brow raised. " I <I>don't</I>
think so…Oh it ended the war alright…but you have to remember who
was fighting the war…It was essentially Seigi's tribes and my
northern tribes versus Uragiri's from the west…Dento was never
actively involved in the combat." Sensing a lack of understanding
and a need for more information, she continued. "What was the
reason for him training his own forces? Well that one's quite
easy…there was the combination of a potential threat in other
trained humans and the possible loss of territory like what happened
to Seigi and I…….but…what was more important to the Ryu than
even territory was …pride … it was no secret by then that we had
come to pride ourselves on the power and advancement of the humans
underneath us… and Dento always was a bit full of himself …always
bragging about the dragons and such and what their humans were
like….….but….As for going back to the inter-mixing, no…..like
I said earlier….Dento was a stickler for clan law…and can you
ever believe THAT was against the law……Such things were entirely
forbidden to his own clan…despite how some of them felt…and as
for the snakes and serpents…well…it wasn't his clan, it was his
alliance. They were free to do as they pleased…though it was looked
down upon harshly…"</p><P>Now confused, Naruto
spoke. "Okay I get that now…but what would hanyous and law have
to do with Seigi…I mean…I got it that Seigi thought it was great
for them to mix and all and that Dento didn't …but you also said
if it wasn't inside HIS clan it didn't matter…so how could that
help Uragiri?…"</p><P>"Naruto…do you
remember…what I told you earlier about the laws being created by
the four of us…that in return for the binding contract for the
protection of humans and established order on this plane we had to
acquiesce to the demands of both Uragiri and Dento?" Warai asked.</p><P>"ummm..yeah?" he
replied in an obviously 'yeah, so?' manner.</p><P>"Dento and his clan's
demands…well…they were related to clan laws and the balance of
power in the new world. The Ryu were a very ancient clan of demons
back on the home plane. There they held considerable power
…and…upheld equal prejudice……for …Dento… to gain enough
power and support within his own clan to overthrow his predecessor…he
had to make promises, promises to uphold those older prejudices and
maintain the purity of demon rule… those promises focused on the
preservation of the demonic clan lines… The Ryu wanted a known
power structure…something…absolute and inescapable… They feared
that the other clans cut off from the demon plane would join forces
and through breeding as well as the sharing of clan techniques,
consolidate their power … This…this was not something they
wanted…and like I said…we had to agree to their demands for the
greater good." Warai explained in a resigned manner before she
began anew.</p><P>"<I>This</I> is the
reason I told you Uragiri, Seigi, and myself were banned from
teaching humans our clan seals. The law we agreed to for Dento's
sake stated many things. First was the fact that while clan <I>members</I>
were allowed to mix if they should so choose, clan LEADERS were
limited to pure blood mates within their own clan… or WERE
permitted to mix if they would step aside for another to take their
place… As for we, the Kyubi, and our clans? Well, we couldn't
step aside…we were the absolutes in the new
world…….the…consequences… for us breaking the contract were
the total voiding of the binding contract…and possibly the start of
the wars once again…" Warai paused to take a breath and collect
her thoughts on the issue.</p><P>"The passage of clan
techniques also fell into these laws… The clans were not to share
their techniques with any demon outside their own clan in the first
place…The only ones that WERE permitted were the ones that might've
been bound in by mating…As for the humans…" Warai's mouth
tugged up into what might be a small smile. "Uragiri was not the
only one to play the law….Seigi and I both clearly understood that
for our minor clans there was room to bend the laws. It stated they
weren't supposed to share with other <I>demons</I>….it never made
ANY sort of mention of humans… Apparently, the Higher Ryu never
thought that one up...but…but for us…the Kyubi……things were
not the same…" What once might have become a smile on Warai's
tear stained cheeks died quickly. " Like our future mates…we were
to teach absolutely no one from outside our clan our techniques…even
then…because they were of the Kyubi, our own personal techniques
were to be shared only with our mates or children, those who would
possibly become the next Kyubi should something happen to any one of
us…As for our clan techniques in general, like I said, they were
not for those from outside the clan….In fact, should a member bring
in a mate from outside the clan of the particular Kyubi…the new
member and their progeny were never to be taught the skills of the
clan…………it was wholly unfair and limiting….but…..this…this
is what we agreed to….this is what was law….and this is what
Uragiri needed to be broken." Warai finished while wiping yet
another tear from her eye.</p><P>"You said that he
found what he needed earlier…so …what happened? Did someone else
finally teach an Ookami or some other demon skill to another clan's
member or human …or did one of the demon lords marry and refuse to
step down? What happened?" Naruto pressed, now hungry for the
truth.</p><P>"…yes.." was
Warai's cryptic answer.</p><P>"What do you mean by
yes? Was it one or the other?"</p><P>"…both…"</p><P>"What? Who?"</p><P>"…who do you
think…" was Warai's near silent reply.</p><P>Naruto pondered it for
a moment in silence. 'An infraction so great that it would lead to
war? A leader that would refuse to leave his position after taking an
outside mate? Someone that would teach techniques to outsiders? Who
could it be….A regular lord would just step down rather than
bringing war to Seigi after he had taken them in…A regular lord
wouldn't risk teaching his techniques at the possible cost of a
war….Whoever did it…they thought they could either stand toe to
toe with the kyubi …or that they wouldn't mind…that they'd
just bite the bullet….Who would be so arrogant as to think they
could take on the Kyubi?...what kind of….' Naruto stopped in mid
thought as some pieces clicked together. '…oh no…the one who
was attacked…the one who Uragiri wanted to crush…the one that
became the most powerful demon on the plane and the actually still
trusted those around him to the point that he thought they could be
reasoned with….'</p><P>'Seigi'</p><P>He was nearly stunned
into silence when his brows rose in shock and the truth dawned on
him. Still, he managed to stutter out a few words. " Wha what! I
thought you said if a Kyubi were to break those laws then total war
could erupt because of the Ryu's strictness on tradition! 
Seigi…Seigi knew the rules! Why would he do that? How…how did it
happen? Who did he do it with?"</p><P>Warai stretched her
arms and legs out and leaned back against the gates as Naruto waited
impatiently for an answer. After seeing him spaz somewhat and
gathering her own thoughts and feelings on the issue through the
painful memoires, Warai spoke. "He did it…because… he was in
love….he did it because he had faith in the goodness of others…
and he did it because he believed in his own strength…"</p><P>"But!" Naruto began
only to be cut off by Warai.</p><P>"No Naruto…he…wasn't
wrong. Seigi did so much for those around him…and his heart was
pure… He honestly thought that even Dento would allow his
interbreeding with enough pressure and argument…that given enough
time he could plead his case and try for the changing of the
contract…but Naruto…like I said …he thought wrong……especially
so once it was discovered WHO he had taken as his mate…a human
woman of all people…" Warai's eyes closed and her visage went
neutral just as Naruto's eyes grew in size and his face contorted.
Before he could stutter out his reaction though, she resumed.
"…his…'mate' was indeed a human woman. Apparently, after
spending so much time amongst your people trying to bring both sides
together, he became fond of your kind…very fond. In particular, his
fondness grew into affection during the wars… He saw the strength
and potential of your kind…what could be with a little effort and
instruction" Warai paused and turned her head to make sure Naruto
had taken what she'd said so far. "He fell in love with your
people first…it was only a matter of time before actually took one
your kind for his own…and…eventually, it happened. While he could
not teach techniques himself, he could observe their training and
point out small things, the basics as they were, and how to improve
them. It was during one of these occasions that he met a young woman
training with the Toad clan…and no, she wasn't a hanyou to any
sort of degree… I suppose it was during his 'pointing out'
session that he grew to like her and she him… from…from…what
Gamabunta told me, he was so taken with her that he actually began to
secretly train her in the ways of the Ookami and not just any Ookami,
but indeed his own personal skills…and that…from there…things
just skyrocketed off..."</p><P>The fox demon now
turned fully around and sat in a meditative position as Naruto move
to mimic her. "They were able to keep it secret for many years…even
when they were wed…but …eventually it was impossible to hide any
longer. It just can't be done…not when there's a hanyou baby
born with all the marks of the Ookami…….so…it was only a matter
of time before word was leaked, despite his alliance's efforts to
keep the knowledge suppressed."</p><P>"so…did they attack
as soon as they heard…?" asked Naruto.</p><P>"…<B>no..they
didn't…"</B> Warai replied as the glowing, crimson color in
her eyes increased in its intensity. " As soon as Uragiri found out
he planned his scheme and then set to work….he didn't want to
take any chances against the power of a ten-tail so he first
contacted Manda to come up with the right way to manipulate Dento...
After speaking with one another and figuring out how to do it best,
they set out….Their goal…was no longer just the defeat of Seigi
and the Ookami…they…they wanted to destroy his entire country and
alliance…they…wanted to murder his clans, enslave his humans, and
take over the northern lands for themselves…"</p><P>Warai snarled before
speaking through tight lips. " They ….they went to Dento…and he
agreed to go to war…he was…infuriated…just as they had
hoped…and it took only a few small efforts to convince him of the
need for the destruction of the north in its entirety. Their …final…
argument… was against Seigi's own offspring and its possible
power…they were fearful of the possibilities…after all…if Seigi
was able to transcend the limits of a demon, would they be able to
transcend the limits of humanity? Would it be possible for a human to
obtain a ninth gate? Would they soon be greeted by humans with the
powers of nine-tailed lords?" Warai stopped and clenched her eys
shut. Turning face down she ended. " …that was all it took for
them to sentence Seigi, his family, and his people to death…"</p><P>Warai stayed silent as
her fists clenched and her teeth grinded against each other. She was
angry, very angry, and it showed… It's hard to miss bright red
flames shooting off someone after all… Naruto sat in between a
mixture of fear, awe, and mortification. As the flames began to
lessen in their intensity she growled out the full measure of
Uragiri's plan.</p><P>" It didn't take
long for them to come up with something that utilized their full
power… Their… strategy… was to attack the Ookami first while
unprepared with the full measure of their forces and crush Seigi and
then move on a genocidal campaign against the other clans… or…
Have their forces hold him back until his family could be secured
and…well…I think you can guess the rest…"</p><P>"Is…Is THAT what
happened?" Naruto questioned unsurely.</p><P>Warai's grimace
shifted somewhat into a foreboding snarl before she replied.</p><P>"No, not exactly…it
seems that even some insects have honor… One of Uragiri's
underlords, Katsuya of the Snails, was disgusted by Uragiri's plot
and warned Seigi and his people of the coming storm… it wasn't
much, but it at least allowed them a short time to scramble their
forces beforehand and…and…well…they…they were able to prepare
to some degree…"</p><P>Warai's flames now
fully rescinded and sense of depression and grief became apparent in
her demeanor.</p><P>"When…they finally
did attack… Seigi and his boys were already waiting for them…"
Warai gave a dark chuckle. "Oh yes, they got one <I>hell</I> of a
surprise when the sneak attack turned into a trap."</p><P>Warai lifted her face
too look Naruto in the eyes.</p><P>" Seigi may have been
trusting, but he wasn't an idiot to any degree. He knew that as
soon as Dento had agreed to the genocide the battle wasn't about
territory or even pride any more. It was a fight…a struggle...for
survival and the right to exist on this world…It was then that any
thoughts about pulling punches or a defensive campaign stopped
completely. It was kill or be killed. So…he set up his forces for
maximum leverage and efficiency. He had them fight their natural
enemies. He ordered the lord of the birds to take his kin and duel
against the spiders. The wolves and dogs were to face off against the
dragons and serpents. The frogs under lord Gamabunta along with the
defector Katsuya and his kind were positioned to take on the Mantis
and Snakes… As for Seigi himself…he…he had to battle with both
Dento, Uragiri, and the entirety of the scorpion clan…and…all…all…by
himself…" Warai finished in tears with her eyes once more to the
floor though this time they did not rise once more.</p><P>"Wait a minute! What
about you Warai? I thought you were his friend and stuff? How come
you didn't help them? Was it because you were worried about your
own people or that they didn't want to go or what?" Naruto asked
confusedly.</p><P>"Oh god Naruto…I…I
…I wish I could say that…I…I want to say that… but…but …"
Warai trailed off as she burst into open sobbing and hugged her
knees. Naruto didn't know what to do. The fox woman had been nice
to him, had seemed deeply regretful about her actions, and had been
spilling out her whole life story. He was just so confused. He was
usually so lonely that having anyone willingly talk to him without
insult was a real treat, but…this woman was the demon that caused
that. Should he comfort her? He had placed his hand upon her shoulder
before to steady her in hopes of hearing what had happened…but he
still hadn't heard exactly why…perhaps…perhaps a little more
and the truth would come out. It didn't really matter either to a
certain point if she had caused his pain anyways…he had made a
promise to himself, on the same level of his dream to become hokage,
to help those in pain. To do for others what none would do for him…….
Also… it didn't hurt that she already could've killed him, but
chose not to…With that in mind, he slowly approached the cage,
turned to the side, and pushed through…</p><P>Warai was already in
sorrow after having drug up so many painful memories, but…having to
recall her own part it in hurt so much more… It reminded her of her
first great failure and then of those after….She probably would've
stayed a wreck much longer if it hadn't been for the sensation of
thin arms wrapping themselves around her body. Completely surprised
by the physical contact, She abruptly stopped her sobbing as tears
continued to slide down her cheeks. Looking down she saw exactly what
she had felt, the thin arms of a child… "Na Naruto-kun ?" she
stuttered out.</p><P>"Listen
Warai…it's…it's okay. You…you still haven't told me
why…but having learned all that I have so far…and by judging your
character I…I don't think you're so bad. I…I am still angry
with you yes, but I …I think you really are sorry. I… haven't
completely forgiven you yet…but I also think…that with time…I
might… so…please… Warai. Don't cry…if you…don't want to
tell me what happened now…it's okay. I'm not going anywhere
anyways…but…if you do want to continue, the easiest way to get it
out is to just spill it and then deal with it…"</p><P>"Oh Naruto." Warai
cried out as she took him into her own arms and hugged him tightly.
"Thank you Naruto…thank you…I…I think I can continue now…."
Warai released her embrace as a now red-faced Naruto backed away from
her and moved to brace his back against the cage. Warai took notice
of his coloration and blushed a bit herself after realizing what she
had done. Moving back to the topic of conversation, however, sobered
her up quickly. She was nearly in tears all over again as she began
to speak, but maintained her composure to 'simply spill it out'
for Naruto…With that, she started once again.</p><P>"Seigi…he…faced
them alone…because I would not come to help him… Uragiri hadn't
just planned to get Dento to work with him…he had also worked to
keep me from helping Seigi…and…he succeeded….Why Naruto? Why
wouldn't I help him?...It…it was because I was bitter and I…I
felt betrayed myself…" Warai paused to calm her nerves and keep
from breaking down. "Before…before we came over… Seigi and I…we
were already very close…we…we both reached our powers as
nine-tails together…we…both spent so much time together…we
started to become intimate, involved with one another…but…but
when we came…we had to separate to keep the balance… As I said
earlier…the laws…those DAMN laws we agreed to… kept us apart…
Over time Seigi…he moved on…but I…I never did… I always
thought that some day, the laws might be changed so that we could be
near one another again…it was what I hoped for…….when I found
out about Seigi and his wife…I …I was heartbroken…I…was so
angry I didn't even think about what I was doing….He…he came to
me for help Naruto…he…begged me Naruto. He BEGGED me to help save
his family and people…and….and I said no…My people, the Tanuki
and the bears…the inu and Ookami were their friends and in some
cases family…they wanted to help save them…….. when I said no
many were disgusted. They cried out and yet I refused…Eventually I
gave in to their pleas….but by then….by then…it…was too
late…" Warai looked upwards to try and keep herself from crying
anymore.</p><P>"The battles were all
over… the spiders had mostly won against the birds though both
sides had sustained heavy losses… The Frogs had managed to force
Manda and his kin to flea while the Mantis were wiped out… and the
battle between the wolves,dogs, dragons, and serpents…." Naruto
could see tears streaming down Warai's face despite her upturned
chin. "There…were bodies everywhere Naruto… The Dragons had
been fanatical while the Wolves had fought for their homes and
family…they…they tore each other to pieces …there were barely
any left alive and…none left whole…it…it was horrible. A
massacre, the likes of which had not been seen since the darkest days
of the demon world…Between the dogs and serpents…losses were not
nearly so great…but the majority were casualties on the side of the
serpents…As…as for Dento,Uragiri, the scorpions, and Seigi…….by
the time I got there Uragiri was already dead, the scorpions were
also all but destroyed, and …Dento and Seigi both were taking their
last breaths…" Seeing their faces and hearing their voices travel
through her thoughts, Warai stopped only to start again a second
later. " Dento was heaving…but he would last a little longer
while Seigi…Seigi was spent and moments from death…he …had his
wife next to him crying over his body. When…he saw me… he
signaled me to come to him…he…he begged me to protect his
family…to make sure that they'd be okay through hthe times that
were coming…after that…the strain of the tenth gate proved too
much for him…and…Seigi died…….I wanted to weep, to say I was
sorry, but any apology would've been meaningless…If I had
come…then… there was the chance his death could've been
avoided… so…I kept my grief inside and went to Dento…"
Warai's shoulders slumped as the explanation of Seigi and Dento's
final moments began.</p><P>"In the end…he was
sorry for what he had done to Seigi…that…that is where I learned
of all that happened…of all of Uragiri's scheming and…of the
battles… how they got Seigi… He told me that while He and Uragiri
used eight gates worth each to hold back Seigi, the scorpions went
for his family…He…he realized the only way to save his family was
to use his tenth gate…His tenth tail was proof that he had survived
before…but when he had to face off against the two others and THEY
had activated THEIR ninth gate…things only went down
hill…Apparently, most of the scorpions were actually slaughtered
from errant techniques and collateral damage…but the ones that
neared his family had been utterly crushed… As for Seigi's
injuries…when…Seigi moved to protect his family…Uragiri was
able to poison him with all nine of his tails…….even for him it
meant death…."</p><P>By now, Warai was once
again greatly upset but she carried on. "After the war…I was the
only Kyubi left…it was up to me to become the high lord and leader
of the plane….but… I just didn't have it in me any longer. I
promised to protect Seigi's family and that was all that I intended
to do forever more… When I refused to take the lead….I also left
my own clan to do as it would…I left my own sister Tala in
charge…as for the other clans…my own were disgusted with me and
the other's were broken irreparably. With that…then end of the
age of demon alliances and rule came to an end… the clans separated
and went their separate ways. My bears traveled into what you now
call the lightning country, the Tanuki traveled west to crush what
was left of Uragir's alliance in the Wind country, and the
Kitsune…they roamed free. The same sort of story occurred with all
the others demon clans… They either picked up and moved or stayed
on to instruct their hanyou kin and clans… As for the Ryu…as per
Dento's dying declaration…their clan laws were abolished for what
few remained…he wished only for them to live freely and
happily…Many of them…felt a need to atone for their past sins and
THAT is how your people obtained the seal of the Ryu… More or
less…this established the structure of what your world is
now…though with minimal changes and trends"</p><P>"So…did you stay on
and protect what was left of the Ookami and Seigi's family?"</p><P>Warai was quiet and
didn't answer Naruto until he spoke up again to gain her attention.</p><P>"Warai?"</p><P>"Sorry…but…yes…I…I
tried to..for a while…"</p><P>"tried?" Naruto
questioned carefully.</p><P>"Things…things
didn't work out the way they were supposed to… I…I was still
feared as a Kyubi, but it wasn't enough to keep certain individuals
away. With the new order becoming dependent on bloodlines…many
feared the potential strength of Seigi's child… and the other
possible children of the Ookami…they wanted to get rid of the
threat before it materialized… while we were still weak and I was
still grieving….I… I couldn't save them Naruto…" Warai
burst into heaving sobs and coughs once again. " I…I failed him
again Naruto… he died for them and I…let it be in vain…"</p><P>"It's okay Warai…"
Naruto comforted her as he moved to hug her once again.</p><P>"No…no it's not
Naruto…" she cried. "when the clans attacked I… moved out to
face them… I didn't think about it being a decoy…when I got
back I couldn't find them anywhere Naruto…they were gone…the
only ones I saw were a pack of wounded hanyou retreating……I…
knew they were dead… Seigi's wife had been strong…to be able to
fight so many and to actually seriously wound so many as well…but
she was only human…she had her limits…She couldn't have
survived……I was angry then and slaughtered the party and moved
back to save what few Ookami were left only to find none of them
alive either… I…I had failed them so miserably Naruto…Seigi…I
… failed him in every way possible… the world of peace he
envisioned with demons and humans living and working beside one
another was lost…and it…it…didn't even end there… Bloodline
wars ran rampant as a race began for domination and whole clans were
being wiped out… that's why there aren't that many bloodlines
around now… they were killed… I tried desperately to restore
order…but the world had turned into a living hell."</p><P>"Wh..what did you do
Warai?"</p><P>"I did the only thing
I thought I could do to preserve some hope for the world he had
wanted… a world of peace for humans…I gathered the clans and
forcibly sent them back to the demon realm… Then … I put a seal
on the rift and made it so that only through a special ritual of
invitation could demons once again walk this world…it's what you
humans call summoning now……Since then, the only demons that have
walked this world have been myself, a few errant lords that refused
to go and ran, and some that were summoned occasionally…"</p><P>"What happened to you
when you were left all alone Warai?"</p><P>"After all that had
happened Naruto? I was just too sad…too depressed, too caught up in
my grief to deal with the world any longer…As soon as it was
stabilized I retreated to my lair here in the Fire country…and…I
went to sleep… At the time…I was hoping that I would never wake
up…."</p><P>"Why did you wake up
then?"</p><P>Silence reigned.</p><P>"Warai?"</p><P>Warai pulled herself
away from Naruto moved a small distance away from him.</p><P>"…I…was
summoned…" she replied darkly as the flames of her anger appeared
once more. " I was summoned out of my lair, forcibly awakened from
my slumber, by a human who would seek my power… I…I'm not quite
sure how he did it… when I placed the seal on the rift I never
imagined that your kind would learn how to manipulate its energies
with your own to such a degree that it would be possible for you to
summon things as well as people across this plane…I had only
created it lock my kind out…I never imagined the power it would
yield within… he…the human… he used it to call me into a
chamber he had prepared… He had even managed to procure demonic
binding seals… they held me at bay so I was able to see …wh…what
he …ha had done …t-to get me there…he must've perverted a
summoning contract from somewhere…reverse engineered it in some way
to discover its roots and the way in which to summon whatever he
would desire…he…he had called my own family… the Kitsune… out
from the home plane…and…worked his way up through the ranks…"
Warai's anger rose to new heights as her demonic features
intensified and she punde her first against the ground making the
sounds of contact reverberate throughout the enclosure. " They were
CHILDREN Naruto…he…called the kits …and tortured them to give
incentive for their parents to come when he called them…he…worked
through my whole family Naruto just so he could sap them of their
life energy and power so that he could summon me to use for his own
plans…. I …saw their bodies Naruto…the first thing I saw after
waking up from the failure of my friends and loved one was the
massacre of my FAMILY…I saw my…sister dead…I could…tell…she
had struggled against the seals, but even for a five-tail they were
too much……the seals were complex…far too complex for any human
to have known…but…he had them……I would've been completely
under his power as well if I had not been at least an eight-tail…"
Warai slammed her knuckles against the ground once more as her nine
tails came to move and pummel the ground and bars much the same way.
"<B>THAT FOOL! THAT MONSTER! HOW COULD HE HAVE DONE THAT!</B>"</p><P>Warai sat shaking in
fury until her demeanor calmed some what once more and her dark, cold
voice emitted out through the cage…</p><P>"He got one hell of a
surprise when I was able to break the seals and make a move towards
him…he didn't stick around long though…he ran as soon as he
knew I was uncontrollable…I don't why he was so surprised, he
should've known that those demon seals were known to incite rage
and mental imbalance in their targets… and…after he slaughtered
the only precious people I had left in either world what did he
really think I was going to do?...He actually thought that I, the
Kyubi no Kitsune would be stopped by such a thing and bow down to him
AFTER THAT? Hmmphh. Arrogance…it only slowed me down….and…I…I
wanted revenge…so…so badly… I could taste it…I wanted to make
him and everything he cherished suffer…not just for my clan…but
for everything that I'd seen…I wanted to lose my self in
destruction and become fury incarnate… I wasn't right in the mind
completely…but..I…I WANTED to do it…so I … I followed him for
weeks through Fire Country to Konoha …your home… when I got there
and saw who lived in the village… my fury only grew even more
…….Konoha's proud bloodline…the HYUGA…they…were
different, but I still recognized them… they… they were the ones
who had attacked Seigi's family… I saw them and I thought that
the massacre of MY family had been only another play for power… I
…I wanted revenge even more then… I wanted to destroy the whole
city for not just my own family now ….but Seigi's as well… I
wanted closure….and so…I attacked…"</p><P>Naruto was now sitting
with his own back to the bars and his arms held round his knees.
Warai sat a ways downs looking at him, trying to pick up on his body
signals while he was in thought… Would he accept her?... She
wondered…</p><P>'So…so that's
what happened…" Naruto thought. "She…lost everyone she ever
cared about… she failed the one she cared about most, then she
failed him again in his last wish and the protection of his dreams,
and THEN she was awakened only to learn that what little she had left
in this world or the other had been taken from her… She was
overcome with grief and anger … and… she said that the seals that
had held her affected her mind in a way……..but she also said that
she HAD wanted to attack, to do what she did…. And now she's
sorry though… She said she was sorry because of what has happened
to me… I wonder… why? … well, I guess I ought to say
something…'</p><P>"Warai… I… I can
understand now what happened… If I ever had anyone precious to me …
and they were taken away … I would be angry and probably want
revenge too…but what you did was wrong and nearly unforgivable…"</p><P>Warai's somewhat
hopeful plummeted. "I… I can understand you also Naruto-kun … I
wouldn't forgive me either if I was you … after everyth…"</p><P>"BUT " Naruto
interrupted. " You have said your apology, you have trusted me with
the truth, and you have shown sorrow… both for what you did… and
for what has happened to me… so… I guess no major hard feelings…"</p><P>"but…why Naruto?"
Warai asked with barely restrained tears in her eyes.</p><P>"Because… I made
another promise to myself Warai… that… I would help others in
pain. That I would do for others what no would do for me … and…you,
Warai… definitely fit that bill… You were hurt just as badly as
anyone in the attack … and the Leaf nin was foolish enough to track
you into the village and use his comrades as shields for his
actions…Konoha was a victim of circumstance…. Also, the truth is…
I … I can't find any real faults in you that I couldn't see
happening in myself…"</p><P>"OH THANK YOU
NARUTO!" Warai cried out in joy as she grabbed NAruto and took
him into a tight embrace once more…though this time his face was
unfortunately muzzled deep into her…'mounds'. As the tears of
joy swept down her face Warai noticed that Naruto had gone unusually
silent… "Naruto-kun?" she asked unsurely. "Naruto?" she
asked once again. It was then that she looked down and realized what
was happening. With a shriek she pulled back and a blue faced Naruto
gasped for breath.</p><P>/ ……….
 / ………… / ……….. /
…………. / …………. / ………..</p><P>Whoo hooh. Got that
over with… It took me forever to figure out exactly how that was
going to go, but damn, this chapter felt like it had no end.
Personally, I felt it was too long, but I didn't think anyone would
want to read my fic anymore if it ended up as the first 30,000 words
being nothing but intro! I sure as hell wouldn't. GAH! Well, as to
what happens next? The long-awaited meat and potatoes of course! I'm
still considering exactly who to have him perform one activity with I
have in mind…</p><P>I won't tell you if
it's a pairing or not, but just b/w us… it's not. Okay? Just
vote for:</p><P>T or H</p><P>That simple neh? Trust
me; you're probably not expecting what will come of that little
vote. AND, if only like 2-3 people vote on it? Well, hurray for them!
Now, as to answering questions…</p><P>I can't.</p><P>Or at least I'm not
supposed to… Doesn't that suck? Well, to be perfectly honest, I'd
just ignore that little rule anyways. The truth is I can't remember
any question at the moment… so negative hurray for me. Well that
about does it… This Madnarutofan – OVER / OUT.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><p align="center">DISCLAIMER:
Every time I write this dislaimer…. a small part of my soul dies….
I don't own Naruto… just all that junk you spent the last few
chaps reading about…</p><p align="center">'never
alone'</p><p align="center">CH.7</p><P>It
was once again a beautiful day in Konoha. The sun was shining
brightly, the birds were singing, and the people were out in throngs
enjoying the pleasant warmth of the sun and a steady breeze. If not
for a few tell tale signs of danger, death, and destruction, no one
would ever be able to tell that things were far from perfect. For
instance, in one remote corner of Konoha, smoke still wafted up into
the air in huge pillars as the last vestiges of what was once a
housing complex smoldered. Not too far from that complex and another
large pile of ash and debris lay one Uzumaki Naruto…</p><P>As
the sun's heat began to beat down upon his covering of trash,
Naruto started to stir. Sitting up slightly while wiping the sleep
from his eyes, Naruto smiled as the events of the night before ran
through his mind.</p><P>Kyubi,
seals, an age of demons long gone by, bloodlines, and Warai…</p><P>All
these things ran through his mind and he continued to smile despite
the fact that his home was destroyed and what few earthly possessions
he'd acquired had also been lost. He smiled because he now knew
something that warmed his heart more than anything else had ever
done.</p><P>He
learned that he had never been alone.</p><P>He
had learned that someone had actually always been there. That someone
had seen every thing…</p><P>That
someone cared…</p><P>It
felt great.</p><P>When
did he learn this? Only after he had 'disengaged' himself from
Warai's 'features' of course. She had told him all of her inner
feelings, about how she felt miserable for what had happened to him,
how she had grown to care for him and how she was saddened that she
had only been able to heal him by flooding him with her chakra, how
she admired his determination, and most importantly…</p><P>How
she wanted to help with his dreams.</p><P>'Yep'
he concluded to himself. 'It's pretty kick-ass to have an eons
old demon that wants to help you out!'</p><P>He
was giddy with excitement. He couldn't wait to learn more about
everything she'd told him. He also couldn't wait to USE what
she'd shown him…</p><P>It
appeared that Warai had been rather studious in her observations of
the other ninja around Naruto through his memories and as such she
had taken great care in learning their techniques in the hopes that
one day she could share them with Naruto. To both of their delights,
that day had come... to a point at least.</p><P>He
still remembered her other instructions …</p><P>(scene
change)</p><P><I>Warai
put one hand on Naruto's shoulder as he got ready to travel back
outside the cage and into the real world. " Remember Naruto, I've
only taught you the most basic principles of chakra and the henge
technique and even then your control isn't all that great. Don't
think you can take on anyone… They'll mob you and then even all
my abilities won't be able to heal you completely… Your best bet
is to make it into the Hokage's tower through disguise and wait for
him there in secret before any of the nins in the group consider the
possibility of you using ninjutsu… You're on a timer… be safe,
okay?</I></p><P><I>Naruto
grinned at his new friend and gave her a quick hug.</I></p><P>"<I>Don't
worry Warai-chan I'll be careful. I know you only showed me the
absolutely most basic stuff and since I've never really molded my
chakra into anything it won't be that good, but I ought to be able
to do it enough to pass if I'm quick. Now as for the training
thing… How come you want me to try and get the old man to teach me
stuff too when I have you? "</I></p><P>"<I>Listen
Naruto, right now we've made contact and that's great… but from
here on out, we'll only be able to speak and meet through your
dreams when you're asleep. That's just not going to do for
serious training. I'd have to be able to speak to you consistently
through your mind to give you all the pointers and information you'd
need and even then, I'm inside your body. I can't see if you have
the correct stance or anything… the most I can do for right now is
to observe your memories and comment to you on your performance when
you sleep. Later, maybe we'll see about altering the seal a little…
I don't want to mess with it too much, you can never be sure when
the Shinigami are involved…" Warai trailed off momentarily.</I></p><P>" <I>Anyways,
it's obvious you need to learn to protect yourself. Even IF the
hokage goes out and executes or arrests all of the mob members,
there's going to be a lot of bad blood about this. The fact is…
you're always going to be under fire for one reason or another as
my container… You need to learn to protect yourself now…and…
when you do, you'll be preparing yourself for my own training later
on..."</I></p><P><I>Warai
broke off into evil laughter as lightning randomly flashed behind her
in the cage. Subsequently, Naruto sweat dropped.</I></p><P><I>Coming
back to her senses, Waria continued on. " Seriously though Naruto,
I want to help you become the strongest nin ever to walk this earth
and to make sure your dream becomes true….but you're just too
weak right now to undergo my type of training… you need to build up
first. Besides,I already gave you a good reason to use with the old
man… just kind of tweak it when you need to or something…and
don't forget, I want to you to specifically ask for someone to help
teach you the basics of swordsmanship…okay?"</I></p><P><I>Naruto
looked down, nodded his head, and continued on out of the cage.
Turning his head just slightly, he called out and waved a goodbye as
he disappeared…</I></p><P>(scene
change)</p><P>Quietly
closing the door to the hokage's office behind him, a young chunin
vanished into smoke revealing the form of a blonde seven year old.</p><P>'Hmmm,
that wasn't as hard as I thought. I guess no one even…'</p><P>Naruto's
thoughts were cut off as he heard a few mumbled voices and the
movement of approaching feet near the door to the hokage's
chambers. Thinking quickly (spazzing out) he did the only thing that
seemed logical to any other seven year old. He jumped about four feet
into the air and then scurried off to hide behind the old man's
desk….</p><P>The
door opened and one brown haired jounin c and one black haired chunin
entered.</p><P>"Listen
to me Kansanshi, there's no way he's in here. We were watching
this place the whole time in case he forgot the Hokage was out of
town and tried to come here for safety or something, the dumb
brat…Listen, The only person that left the area was some drunk that
happened to be sleeping behind a bunch of garbage! The damn demon
brat was probably somewhere hidden in the complex we all torched."</p><P>"But…but….
The byakugan found no trace of…."</p><P>"Bullshit,
and you know it…The Hyuga aren't really all seeing… and
besides, with everything that was going on, I clearly doubt that they
were completely focused. Plus, as hot as those fires were… do you
really think even his ashes would be left?"</p><P>"but…"</p><P>"Listen,
I'll stay and keep watch myself… Alright? "</p><P>"…are
you sure?" Kasanshi questioned. When he received a nod he smiled.
"okay then."</p><P>And
with that both stepped outside as Naruto let out a small sigh of
relief.</p><P>(scene
break)</p><P>To
say the least, the Sandaime Hokage was pissed. How pissed you ask?
Why, pissed enough that the overwhelming waves of killing intent
rolling off of him were more than enough to cause the weaker captured
nins and villagers involved with the attack on Naruto to pass out.</p><P>He
had just returned from a meeting with the Kazekage of the Sand and
what is the first thing he find when returning home?</p><P>Murderous
mobs out in force…</p><P>A
housing complex left in ruins…</p><P>The
aftermath of a bonfire that had once made up the few comforts of a
lonely child's life…</p><P>And
a missing child…possibly dead…if not likely.</p><P>Gathering
his wits and considering the facts at hand the Sandaime Hokage spoke
to the Wolf masked ANBU member beside him.</p><P>"Kakashi-san…I
am doubtful as to what you will find but…" The older man trailed
off as his desperation and hopelessness surfaced.</p><P>Thankfully,
the wolf-masked ANBU known as Hatake Kakashi interjected…</p><P>"No
problem Hokage-sama it's the least I could do for him now… all
things considered…" Kakashi himself trailed off as memories
bounced aroubd in his head. " I will take three squads to scour the
city. If he is still alive and in the village we will find him."</p><P>"Thank
you…Kakashi…"</p><P>The
ANBU made no further remark as he backed up slightly and then
vanished in a puff of smoke.</p><P>Moving
wearily towards his desk the old man couldn't help but let out a
shudder as he considered the grim possibilities of Naruto's fate.</p><P>'Was
it worth it?' he thought to himself. 'Was the security and unity
of this village worth the life of an innocent… worth the life of a
child? I allowed so much to go on unchecked merely because I needed
to maintain absolute faith in my capabilities as their leader… to
maintain their trust… but what have I really done? Yes, I kept
their faith ..by…turning a mostly blind eye… and I have restored
the village mostly but…now what? Isn't it the truth that I
abandoned the one person in Konoha who needed me more than anyone
else…that I have failed HIM in every way. You wanted him to be a
hero Arashi… not a daily sacrifice to the hate and anger of
Konoha…I…am sorry…"</p><P>With
that last thought, the old man sat himself down behind his desk.
Moving his chair forward he came across something blocking his way.</p><P>'What
in the devil could that be?' the old man pondered. As he finally
brought himself to look underneath his desk, his heart swelled with
joy and his eyes filled with tears as he gazed down upon the form of
a drooling blonde. 'Thank kami you're safe Naruto' the old man
thought as he smiled. His smile quickly turned into a determined
grimace however when his thoughts took a slightly darker turn. ' I
promise you Naruto, things will NOT be the same. I never moved
against them in a major way before for fear of a civil war…but that
won't happen now. I swear to you Naruto… the ones who have done
this to you… they will pay. I don't ever want to see this happen
again… though I wonder… will you ever be the same…'</p><P>As
the Hokage finished his line of thought the young blonde turned over
in his sleep and grasped the bunched up cloth of the bottom of the
Hokage's robes like a pillow for comfort, thus causing a genuine
smile to once again come over the old man's face.</p><P>"I
promise you Naruto" he whispered so as not to wake the boy up.
"Things will be different from now…"</p><P>(scene
change)</p><P>Roughly
three hours later a somber looking Hataki Kakashi knocked at the door
of the Hokage's office. Hearing an affirmation from within, Kakashi
entered and stood before the third hokage himself.</p><P>"I
am sorry Hokage-sama… we have found no evidence of Uzumaki Naruto's
presence. It is… believed… that he burned to death in the inferno
of his housing complex and that his remains have also been reduced to
nothing more than ashes…" Kakashi paused to express his regret at
having not been there to save the boy but trashed that idea when he
got a look at the hokage. It just didn't make sense to the ANBU
member… The hokage cared for the boy and yet…upon hearing of his
death he sat there and smiled off into nothing? After considering the
facts and the kage's odd behavior Kakkshi spoke.</p><P>"Ummm,
Hokage-sama…do you know something that the search and rescue teams
do not?</p><P>"Hmmm?"
said the hokage as he sat back in his chair smoking his pipe</p><P>" I
asked if you know something I don't" replied the man in the wolf
mask.</p><P>"Oh,
yes… Naruto is not dead. He's actually in quite good care at the
moment." Seeing the ANBU's incredulous look and the obvious line
of questions just waiting to be asked, he cut him to the chase. "He's
in my care Kakashi. He's sleeping right here underneath my desk. As
for how he got here or when? I don't know. I only discovered him a
few minutes after your last departure."</p><P>"Has
he awoken at any point yet?" asked Kakashi.</p><P>Remaining
silent for but a moment, the Sandaime replied in kind.</p><P>"No
and to be perfectly honest I'm not even really sure I'd want him
up yet. I still haven't decided what to do with all those involved…
there's a substantial amount… and this time their intentions were
quite obvious… not too mention all the damage they've caused,
both to property and to Naruto. I don't know if he'll ever be the
same carefree child again Kakashi. Who knows how he will turn out
now? A human being can only take so much and…"</p><P>"As
young as he is it's been even worse." Kakashi finished for the
old man. "Yes, it's doubtful he will ever be able to truly love
Konoha now. All we can do now is try to stem any more damage or
attacks from occurring… But how will you do that Hokage-sama. We
thought the law and prosecuting select individuals would be enough to
turn aside many but now…"</p><P>"But
now they seem as if nothing?" The Hokage grumbled. " Yes, I've
noticed Kakshi-san. The trouble is… that for the longest time we've
tolerated all sorts of abuse on the boy. We were afraid that too
strong a reprisal would spark a civil war or worse. This whole time
the peace of Konoha has been aid with the blood and suffering of a
child. No more Kakashi … no more. We've allowed this to go on for
far too long already. The villagers and rebellious nin have become
too bold… You know what I want you and your squads to do…"</p><P>"Are
any to be spared Hokage-sama" questioned the Anbu in a now
stone-cold business manner. The old man was hesitant to answer and
the ANBU had to prod him for a response. "Hokage-sama?"</p><P>"No
Kakashi…this… has to be done."</p><P>"Hai
Hokage-sama." Replied the ANBU. With that, he once again
disappeared into a puff of smoke.</p><P>Whispering
only to himself and the silent room the old man spoke once more.</p><P>"For
the future…for Konoha…for him"</p><P>Well
hello there every body. I bet you're still wondering what the whole
T or H thing was neh? WELL GUESS WHAT! You find out next chapter.
Seriously though, I thought I kinda said it wasn't pairing related.
I got a bunch of vote for either Tenten, Temari, or Hinata, Jesus
etc… ha hah a, I bet you guys will be surprised. Oh well. As to
some negative comments about the length of the intro… well to
answer you. YES this will be epic length. I've got BIG plans for
Naruto and his world. Although, it will take awhile to get there and
a lot will occur along the way. I always love reviews both negative
and positive… 'hint hint' .</p><P>reposting
Whoops! Sorry about the confusion. I put in scene breaks but for some
odd reason they were removed in the data transfer grumbles oh well.
I just did this really fast to fix this. Now, I've had time to read
a couple a' reviews. My my my, aren't WE all out for a little
vengeance? Hmmm, well, I'll say this. You won't see it first hand
but it will be obvious when it's happening and I think you will
find the after effect "enlightening" to those in the Naruto
world… 'borrows thunfer and lgithning background from Warai's
earlier evil laughter' HA HA HA HAH HA HAH HA….yeah….. time to
go to class.</p><P>Well
this is Madnarutofan signing of for now!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><p align="center">DISCLAIMER:
…….. I do not own Naruto… if I did…</p><p align="center">…</p><p align="center">I'd use
it to get free food from ninjaburger.</p><p align="center">VISIT:

enlightening ninja-tastic experience!</p><p align="center">'never
alone' ch.8</p><P>Finding himself once
more in the dark caverns of his inner mind, Naruto realized he
must've been asleep. Considering his options and the fact that he
knew he was hidden underneath the old man's desk, he decided to use
the opportunity to go see Warai again. After a short walk, he arrived
at her cage and slipped through the bars once more, though 'slipped'
might not have been the correct term in this text. The fact is,
Naruto WALKED in between the bars this time.</p><P>'Strange' he
thought. 'It looks like the whole thing changed to hold something
else…I don't get it. What else could be in here with Warai? AND
speaking of her where is she?'</p><P>Pausing in a moment of
thought, Naruto raised a hand to scratch the back of his head.</p><P>'oh well' he
thought. 'might as well…'</p><P>A second after, the
tranquility of the now enormous chamber was shattered as Naruto
bellowed his 'greeting' out.</p><P>"HEY WARAI! WHERE
ARE YOU! I CAME TO SAY HI!"</p><P>Hearing a loud 'THUD'
just to his left he turned and gasped. Right before him lay a giant,
nine-tailed, fox figure…shaking in agony…in the fetal
position…with…its paws over its ears?…and… tears coming from
its closed eyes?…while making whimpering noises?</p><P>Sure it was an odd
sight and all but what was Naruto's reaction after his initial
gasp?</p><P>"AHHHHH, WHERE THE
HELL DID YOU COME FROM GIANT FOX? WHAT DID YOU DO WITH WARAI?"</p><P>The Giant nine-tailed
fox visibly cringed and whimpered once more before its eyes suddenly
opened to reveal two huge pools of what looked like the very fire of
hell itself. Quickly jumping on all fours the fox took an attack
stance and unleashed its tails on the area behind while snarling.</p><P>"<B>WHERE THE HELL
DID I COME FROM?" </B>the titanic demon roared. <B>"WHAT THE
HELL? HAVE YOU COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN OUR CONVERSATION? YOU KNOW THE
ONE ABOUT ME BEING THE FREAKING <I>KYUBI NO KITSUNE </I>AND BEING
SEALED INSIDE OF YOU!" </B></p><P>The towering she-demon
paused to hear Naruto's amazing reply.</p><P>"Oh."</p><P>Demon eyes stared down
blankly into their human counterparts</p><P>" <B>OH? OH? YOU COME
IN HERE BELLOWING AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS RIGHT INTO MY FREAKING
EARS <I>WHICH</I> BY THE WAY ARE <I>THOUSANDS</I> OF TIMES MORE
POWERFUL THAN YOUR HUMAN ONES AND ALL YOU CAN SAY IS <I>OH</I>!"</B></p><P>"So you <I>are</I>
Warai right?"</p><P>The Demon's face
contorted into an unidentifiable mix of anger, confusion, and
hopelessness before all its tails dropped limply down and its head
sunk down beneath its shoulders.</p><P>'My gods' thought
the she-demon. 'Is this what happens when a child is fed solely on
ramen? I can guess what the new step to Naruto's 'training'
is…' Coming out of her thoughts, the demoness deigned to answer
Naruto's inherently stupid question.</p><P>"<B>Yes, Naruto it's
me…"</B> she let out exasperatedly.</p><P>"Oh… hey then!"
Naruto said in a normal greeting tone as he waved and smiled up at
the nine-tailed fox.</p><P>"<B>Hello
…Naruto-kun…"</B> replied the twitching giant. <B>"Listen,
could you turn around for a moment while I transform into my human
form?"</B></p><P>"What? Umm why?"
Naruto asked in genuine interest.</p><P>"<B>Because I doubt
you want to see me naked and that's exactly what I'll be when I
first transform. I'll tell you when I've summoned by clothing.
Okay?"</B></p><P>The demoness chuckled
out in a hearty laugh as Naruto blushed deeply and then flew around
with his hands on his face and his head pointed to the ground.</p><P>A few seconds later the
change was complete.</p><P>"It's okay now
Naruto-kun." The now human fox-woman stated.</p><P>"Are-are you sure?"
stuttered out a still beet red Naruto</p><P>"I'm sure
Naruto-kun." cooed Warai as she came in from behind him and gave
him a small hug, thus eliciting an 'Eep!' from the young boy. "So
what are you doing down here anyways? Did you make it to the Kage's
tower and office yet? I haven't checked your memories or looked
through your sight for awhile…"</p><P>"Yeah" replied the
blonde. "I made it there all right but it was so tiring… I know
what you mean now with the weak thing…It's a good thing too that
I henged into a drunken bum. It was really hard and some of the chaka
illusion messed up and looked like a burn mark on me. If they hadn't
thought that I was a dirty homeless person they might have stopped to
wonder why I was covered in soot and stuff. I guess I also kinda got
lucky that no one found me in my hideaway while I was practicing at
first. I think they only saw me when I actually came out…thank
goodness. Anyways, by the time I got there I was so tired I almost
felt like dropping. I was really worried for a moment when two nin
came in. I had to hide under Ji-san's desk till they left.Actually,
I'm still a little worried…"</p><P>Now weary of the facts
at hand the fox woman questioned the boy. "Why?"</p><P>"well…you see…"
he began while grinning and scratching the back of his head. "I
kinda got comfortable down there and fell asleep underneath the
desk…and…um…I think they're still right outside the door…"</p><P>Silence reigned in the
chamber.</p><P>"WHAT?" shrieked
the demoness. "What are you doing here then? Somebody could be
there right now ready to kill you or something! Get out! GO! SHOO!"
cried out the fox woman as she literally tossed Naruto over her
shoulder, ran to the gates, and then lobbed him out…though for all
her 'fear' she happened to have a smirk on her face.</p><P>As Naruto flew through
the air and out of the cage he considered the possibility of Warai
being right.</p><P>'yeah, right.' He
snorted. 'she was just mad about the ear thing'.</p><P>Coincidentally, a
certain fox-demon was thinking. 'Well, it could be true…they
might've found him.'</p><P>Naruto hit the ground
of far outside the cage and dissipated as he skid to a slow stop.</p><P>'Ouch. I guess I
misgauged the distance…' thought Warai.</p><P>(SCENE CHANGE)</p><P>Slowly bringing his
senses into focus Naruto realized five things:</p><P>One: He was still
underneath the old man's desk.</p><P>Two: He was still okay.</p><P>Three: He now had a
pillow</p><P>Four: The pillow was
actually the end of someone's bunched up robes.</p><P>Five: The current
'pillow' was being worn by someone that happened to be sitting
right in front of. A person, that he could tell was now aware of his
consciousness, and probably was there to kill him.</p><P>With this is mind, and
no other logic evident to him other than Warai's previous prophesy
of doom, he did what came up first in his list of things to do as a
last act of defiance. He let loose his battle cry and attacked….</p><P>…with his teeth.</p><P>(PERSPECTIVE CHANGE)</p><P>The old man had been
there still smoking his pipe and thinking about the future of Konoha
when all of a sudden Naruto began to stir. Laying his pipe down, he
adjusted himself to his desk so that when Naruto emerged he would see
his face and know it was okay. He remained there waiting for Naruto
to gather his wits and come out, but Naruto didn't move. Instead,
he just kept still. Realizing that Naruto couldn't tell who he was
just by his robes and the fact that he was probably very shaken up,
he began to move down to make contact and soothe the child. Naruto,
however, apparently had other plans.</p><P>"ARRGHHH, YOU'LL
NEVER TAKE ME ALIVE!"</p><P>…and with that, he
wrapped his little arms around the old man's leg and sunk his nice,
big, shiny set of teeth firmly into the lower calf of the third
hokage of Konoha, drawing blood…</p><P>The old man had his own
cry, though it wasn't for battle…more like horror, and let it
screech out.</p><P>"AHHHHHH! GET IT
OFF GET IT OFF GET IT OFF!"</p><P>(PERSPECTIVE CHANGE)</p><P>Grinding his teeth into
the enemy, Naruto realized he had drawn blood and he smiled. At least
he would go down having done that much damage. He was sad though,
he'd just met Warai really and it would've been nice to get to
know her more…to learn new things…it just wasn't fair… he'd
just made his first friend and now?</p><P>His thoughts were cut
off as the enemy began sweeping his leg back and forth under the desk
trying to knock him off on either of the sides that housed cabinets.
His head bounced against the sides and made him feel dizzy but then
he would only bite back down with renewed vigor.</p><P>If the bastard thought
he was going to get rid of him that easily he had another think
coming all right! Uzumaki Naruto was NOT going to go down THAT easily
at all!</p><P>"TAKE THIS" he
yelled</p><P>(PERSPECTIVE CHANGE)</p><P>He had tried to cry out
against Naruto, to stop him non-violently, but the child just bit
down so damn hard and he couldn't even stutter anything out! IT
HURT LIKE HELL ON HIS OLD BONES AND FLESH!</p><P>'I'm sorry
Naruto-kun, but I'm sure you'll forgive me later for this…'
thought the hokage as he took up a new tactic and began to knock the
blonde against one side of the desk and then the other. 'It's
working!' thought the thankful hokage. But then something went
wrong. The child dug in with even more force than before. 'DAMN IT
NARUTO!' screamed the old man inside his head. He then rammed the
child even harder but once again it only resulted in increased force
on his own body.</p><P>And then…for a split
second…he could feel it… the dull throbbing ache that only THAT
organ can produce when prophesizing its own injury…</p><P>"TAKE THIS!"
roared the child.</p><P>'No' he thought in
fear. 'He wouldn't…'</p><P>His thoughts betrayed
him however and he was caught wholly unprepared when Naruto flipped
his own lower torso and legs out from underneath the desk and then
lauched his heel into the most precious and protected area of a
man…and all while sinking his nails and teeth even deeper into his
calf's flesh.</p><P>(PERSPECTIVE CHANGE)</p><P>'SUCCESS' thought
Naruto gleefully as his blow landed at the man's 'core' and all
his enemy's movement halted to a dead stop. Quickly releasing all
of his holds he fell to the floor and hurried to stand and run out
of the office in hopes of finding other cover to wait out for the old
man. His progress was quickly halted however when he felt an iron
grip at the back of his neck…</p><P>"I DON'T THINK SO!"
yelled the voice of his assailent.</p><P>Naruto barely had time
to register an 'oh' let alone a 'shit' before he was flung
backwards through the air towards the plushy chair at the desk</p><P>(PERSPECTIVE CHANGE)</p><P>As the blow landed many
thoughts passed through the mind of Sarutobi, the Third Hokage of
Konoha. Among them were KILL, DESTROY, MAIM, and VENGEANCE! The
others, the ones that prevented the death of the sealed child, were
PROTECT, DUTY, LOVE, COMPASSION, and KILL SOMEONE ELSE LATER! The
tug of war had been close, but the mental promise of physical release
on another individual had finally won out on the side of life.</p><P>The boy however….he
was running the hell out of the room already…</p><P>'I…I..' stuttered
the still furious hokage in thought. 'D-Didn't go t-through all
that j-just to have him r-run away…no…NO..'</p><P>"I DON'T THINK SO!"
he roared as he dashed with his blinding speed and grasped the back
of Naruto's jacket only to hurl him up, over, out , and at the
chair he had previously been relaxing in.</p><P>'ENOUGH!' thought
the old man. 'JUST STAY THE HELL DOWN FOR A MOMENT!...please…'</p><P>Panting as the full
measure of Naruto's attack came to bear, he could already feel the
swelling and an urge to puke rise. Out of necessity however, he kept
it down. Keeping his distance from Naruto though, he hoped he would
come to his senses…he didn't know if he could take another tussle
like that with the boy and NOT kill him…</p><P>(PERSPECTIVE CHANGE)</p><p align="center">"OOOOOMPHHH"</p><P>Was the sound that
flooded out of young Naruto's lungs and mouth as his small body
collided with the chair. A moment later, his small, beaten, and
upside down form slid down into the crook of the seat.</p><P>'oOoOh' thought the
boy as his senses tried to pry each other apart from the swirling
sensation that had become his consciousness. When they finally HAD
settled down Naruto remained in his slouched form with his eyes
closed. 'I guess this is it. Oh well, at least I got him REAL
good…' mentally snickered the boy as he listened to the ragged
wheezes of his supposed enemy. 'I guess I should at least get a
look at who's going to do me in… If…if I'm going out damn it
I'm at least going to face it proudly…'</p><P>With that, he slowly
opened his eyes and observed the figure of his opponent at the
opposite end of the room. In a single moment he realized how wrong he
had been…and er eh…what he had done…</p><P>Tears quickly began to
pool in his eyes and drip down his face…</p><P>"'J..J..JI-SAN!"
cried Naruto as he flung himself out of the chair and at the old man
nearly as fast as he himself had been sent to the chair.</p><P>The old man felt the
impact of a small body against his own reeling form along with the
sensation of small arms wrapping tightly around his body. Slowly, the
old man knelt down to embrace the child in his arms. The boy quickly
moved his arms to latch around the old man's shoulders and it was
only a matter of time before the third hokage could feel his robe
becoming drenched in tears…</p><P>"Naruto…" the old
man whispered out, almost cracking up himself at the sight of the
boy's fear and tears…</p><P>"Ji-san…Ji-san"
the little boy cried out over and over again as all the recently
events passed through his mind.</p><P>All the fear, the hate,
the danger, the destruction…</p><P>He cried it all out on
the old man's shoulder.</p><P>Eventually, though, he
settled down and actually began to engage in conversation with the
old man hokage…</p><P>"Are you okay
Naruto-kun? Are you injured anywhere?" asked the old man with worry
apparent in his voice.</p><P>"N-no…I…I am
okay…They…they… never even got a-a hold of me. I…I was able
to hide while they….." Naruto trailed off as the images of
murderous mobs and sharpened weapons danced through his head.</p><P>The old man knew it
would be hard for Naruto to recount the recent events. He knew they
were now probably some of the most traumatic yet…but…he had to
know, as someone that cared AND as the hokage….</p><P>"Naruto-kun" the
old man began gently. "What happened while I was gone?" As soon
as the question was out he could feel boy shudder. "Please, Naruto…
I know it's hard but I have to know…"</p><P>Naruto remained still
in thought for a moment before he answered.</p><P>'Yeah…a lot has
happened… I wonder though… should I tell him the truth about
Warai and the Kyubi no Kitsune? Would he even listen or would he wig
out… He never bothered to tell me before…and…he let all that
crap happen to me… BUT I know for a fact he felt bad about it and
all…I just don't know…maybe…maybe later I'll tell him…but
for now…he gets the 'amended' version…'</p><P>Forcing his spirits to
raise to the point where he could at least speak normally, Naruto
answered.</p><P>"A lot has
happened…Ji-san…" Naruto stopped momentarily to break the
embrace with the old man and move back some. Turning his back to the
old man, he brought his arms up and used them to hug himself while in
thought. "When you left…you told me to stay in…but …I…didn't."</p><P>'Naruto…this is why
I didn't want you outside… I knew seeing you out alone without me
in the village would be a bad thing…They were just waiting for such
an opportunity…' thought the wizened old man.</p><P>"It's a good thing
too…" Naruto added right before he turned around to make eye
contact with the Hokage. "If I hadn't, I'd be dead right now."</p><P>"What?" gasped the
Hokage. 'I don't understand…'</p><P>"I went out into
Konoha… roaming the back alleys and all…you know I can't go out
into the main throughways without…well…unpleasant things
happening to me…" the third grimaced for a moment before Naruto
continued.</p><P>"Anyways, I happened
to pass by a certain shop when I was… detained…anyways, I woke up
a little while later and tried to get home to my complex…" A
flash of visible anger rushed out over Naruto's features and the
old man had a siking feeling in his gut. "When I got there… they
were waiting for me. I think they were expecting me to already be
there when they rushed in…"</p><P>'Damn…I was right…I
thought there might've been a leak in my office chunin, I guess
I'll just have to have Kakashi look into that later as well.'
Thought the enraged Hoakge.</p><P>"…so…" went on
Naruto. " I hid behind some garbage and stuff before they knew I
was there…I…I had to sit there and watch as they burned it all
Ji-san…everything…they wanted to kill me…and destroy everything
I've ever touched…everything I ever was…please Ji-san…"
Naruto once again broke down into tears as he stared into the old
man's eyes. " Please…help me…I… I don't want to …I…
I'm afraid…Please…"</p><P>Naruto couldn't even
stutter out his plea but the old man knew what he wanted.</p><P>He wanted to know that
he was safe for once…</p><P>That he wouldn't be
sent out into that alone again…</p><P>That it wouldn't ever
happen again…</p><P>The old man moved
towards the scared child and hugged him once more.</p><P>"I swear to you
Naruto… As long as I breathe, I will not allow anything like this
to ever happen to you again…"</p><P>"So…so…they…they
aren't coming back again?" Asked a hopeful Naruto.</p><P>"No…Naruto-kun…
they aren't coming back…ever…trust me." He continued in
thought in his head. ' and as for the others in the village…I'm
going to make damn well sure that this time the <I>point</I> gets
across.'</p><P>They remained that way
in each other's embrace as Naruto slowly began to fall asleep once
again, though this time, he wasn't afraid. He was, in fact, just
about to drift off completely when a loud 'POOF'sound erupted
into the air and a figure emerged from the smoke. Naruto tensed at
first but seeing that the old man wasn't afraid he began to relax
some. Upon further inspection he saw that the new individual was none
other than the Wolf-masked ANBU he'd been thinking about sometime
earlier.He also noticed there was no small amount of blood on his
person. His thought were broken though by the voice of the Sandaime
Hokage.</p><P>"Is it done Kakashi?"</p><P>"yes…hokage-same."
Replied the man in a wolf mask.</p><P>"How many were there
and of what status were they?" asked the old man in a now grave
tone.</p><P>"I'd say about
fifty to sixty. Among them were several elder Genin, some mid level
Chunin, and one Jounin."</p><P>"Resistance?"</p><P>"Some. The nin put up
a fight, but were easily put down. The villagers though…they ran
quite a bit once they realized what was happening. For the most part
though, it wasn't difficult. They happened to be regrouping near
the initial site…and…" Kakashi slowed down to a halt in speech
as he realized what he was about to debrief in front of an already
traumatized child.</p><P>"Hmmm, do you wish
for me to …continue…this debriefing later Hokage-sama?"</p><P>Looking down the child
in his arms the old man answered.</p><P>"Yes, yes, very well
Kakashi-san. We will continue this at a later date…for now though…
I have to ask two more things of you. The first is to
exe…er…'interrogate' any suspicious chunin that work here in
the tower and could've possibly revealed my leave to the masses…
as you know., that information was supposed to have been kept in
secret… After that though…I was wondering if you could take care
of Naruto-kun here for awhile…until… things settle down. I've
arranged for another apartment for him. Here are the keys and
information."</p><P>As Kakashi simply
nodded his head with a "Hai Hokage-sama" the keys and information
were handed over by the old man.</p><P>"Don't worry
Naruto-kun." Said Kakashi. " Things have been dealt with. Things
might be rough for awhile, but then things will smooth down and
they'll be better than ever for you." 'though that's not
saying much' thought Kakshi.</p><P>Warai's words of
warning flashed through Naruto's mind. 'bad blood' 'danger'
'protection'</p><P>Standing up, the Hokage
brought Naruto with him and began to make his way towards the door as
Kakashi followed. The old man had just opened the door and was
turning around to reassure Naruto and thank Kakashi when a voice cut
him off.</p><P>"You're wrong…both
of you."</p><P>Turning around, both
were shocked to find the normally vibrant blue pools of Naruto's
eyes turned into frigid lakes of ice.</p><P>'no...' thought the
old man. ' I was too late… He is changed… I'm sorry Naruto…'</p><P>'I was right…'
thought Kakashi. 'He is changed. Even his heart couldn't take on
all of this and not be changed… I'm surprised he lasted as long
as he did.'</p><P>"Even if you killed
or arrested everyone that attacked me…" he began, not noticing
the look of surprise at his assumed awareness on the faces of the two
older men. " Things will never smooth out… they aren't ever
going to be that great. The best I can look forward to in the short
run is them just ignoring me or just the stares." The others were
about to say something about his prior statement regarding the
executions when he continued. "I honestly don't know what you've
really done to them…I doubt anything much at all…but there's
only going to be one way I'm ever really going to feel safe in this
place from now on ." 'time to tweak it' thought Naruto.
"There's only one way I can keep this palce as home in my heart…
and that" he stopped momentarily as the two others held their
breath. "Is for me to become stronger…to learn how to defend
myself. I.. I know I'm just a kid…I'm seven… but they're
out there…and they want to hurt me. I don't know why…" 'Well,
actually, Warai told me…'he thought. "…but I only feel it's
going to get worse down the road …what's ahead of me. I need to
become stronger now for then… I need to learn how to protect
myself. So…please… Hokage-sama…"</p><P>'He's dead serious'
the other two thought at the same time knowing the boy.</p><P>"…please help me to
become stronger. I know you're busy… I know you don't have time
to train me yourself but please help with this… Just help me find
someone to train me at least… I don't expect them to train me to
be at your level or anything insane like that…I just want to learn
the basics… to take my first steps on the road to my dream…to be
able to stand up for MYSELF without having to worry about having
protection around me always…"</p><P>The old man and the
ANBU were silent for a few moments considering their own personal
thoughts. Both came to the conclusion that they had been
unfortunately correct in their assumption that Naruto's affection
for Konoha would be tenuous at best. The Hokage, however, in
considering Naruto's request, also realized the truth in the boy's
argument. Indeed his life would be one filled with pain and struggle…
It was also his own personal opportunity to atone somewhat for his
past deeds…or rather, lack thereof.</p><P>He agreed.</p><P>"Okay Naruto-kun. If
this is what it takes to give you the confidence and security you
seek…I shall find instruction for you. "</p><P>Naruto was now grinning
from ear to ear, happy that Warai's plan had been put into place
and that the beginning of his trip to the Hokage's seat had begun.
The old man, however, only knew that the child was rejoicing. Seeing
the brilliance return to Naruto's eyes assured him of his
judgment's correctness. Now as for Kakashi…he had already seen
twice what advanced training had done to other children. Himself the
wolf, and the other the weasel… He was … to say the least… not
as enthused. The Hokage could tell as much from where he stood.</p><P>"Hokage-sa-"
Kakashi began to argue.</p><P>"Silence
Kakashi-san." The old man interrupted with a stern voice and
motioned for him to come near so that Naruto wouldn't hear.. "It's
true Naruto-kun here is very young, but he has valid points. There's
no point in denying the truth about people's treatment of him any
longer OR what his destiny is likely to hold. Also, giving him basic
nin training will only raise him to the level that many of the clan
youth are at prior to entrance into the Academy. More importantly, it
will boost his confidence. I'm sure this is the right choice."</p><P>"Hai…Hokage-sama."
Kakashi resigned dejectedly as he moved back to collect the child.
"Come on Naruto. Let's go get you settled in, I'm sure the
Hokage here has things to do… another of which is now to find you a
<I>suitable </I>instructor. Let's go."</p><P>With that Kakshi
stepped out of the office.</p><P>"Okay." The young
boy chirped back, somewhat glad to be leaving the confines of the
office. Turning around before exiting Naruto called back to the old
man. " Hey Ji-san?"</p><P>"Yes, Naruto-kun?"
the old man replied back.</p><P>"I would really,
really like to have someone good teach me the basics of
swordsmanship. Preferably, someone well versed in the katana and its
'applications'…soooooo, if you could do that I'd be
ultra-thankful!"</p><P>"Okay, Naruto-kun…
I'll see what I can do… but if you're trying to get some
special training like that it might only be for a short time. Skilled
weapon masters are hard to come by and are usually rather busy…but
I promise you I'll do my best…"</p><P>"Okay, as long as
they're strong and can teach me well! THANKS AGAIN OLD MAN!"
Naruto spoke and then yelled as he ran out</p><P>'Naruto…' the old
man thought as he chuckled. ' Okay…now as to whom I have who can
teach you what you'd like… Hmmm, I know I said just the basics,
but to be perfectly honest I'd like you to have the BEST
basics…something tells me you'll need it… Now that leads me to
the best of Konoha's blade masters…'</p><P>The old man stopped to
reach down and pull some files out from a drawer in his desk.</p><P>'Hmmm, I guess we
better update these files…I know for a fact that my student isn't
coming back anytime soon and that's been confirmed for years…I
guess some Chunin data specialists have been slacking off. Maybe I'll
have Kakashi deal with that too? No…no, can't go to the absolute
option EVERY time, can we? Oh well…Now as to the other two
possibilities… I don't know… one's relatively young, but
highly skilled. The other is older and more experienced with nearly
equal skill…hmmm… I guess it comes down to who's on a mission
and who's not. Let's see…'</p><P>The Sandaime Hokage
pulled yet another set of files from his desk.</p><P>'So… <B><U><I>H</I></U></B>ayate
is out on a long term surveillance mission is Wind country….rough…
the winds there can tear your lungs up what with all the sand and if
you don't know how to protect yourself…I guess that leaves…him…'</p><P>"So" the Hokage
announced to himself. " Ikegata <B><U><I>T</I></U></B>omo it is…"</p><P>'Hmmm, doesn't he
have a child?' pondered the old man. 'Oh yes,yes, I remember now,
a nice little girl…but what was her name again….hmmmm.'</p><P>'Ah I have it now!'
elated the hokage.</p><P>"It's Tenten, her
name is Tenten."</p><P>(END CHAPTER)
/</p><P>WOOHOO, another chapter
bites the dust! Well, I can honestly say that I feel kinda saddened
with myself in this chapter. I tried to include a humorous scene
intermixed with the serious stuff but I don' think it flew off too
well. Jeez, you know something has occurred to me? I am way too damn
descriptive in my mind. If I keep this up I'll be updating at the
same speed as the manga progresses and even then I'll be behind by
like ….oh ..lets see…. 278 chapters or so! Which means I ought to
finish my fic ….about three or four years after the manga ends!</p><P>O-O'</p><P>BAH! I HAVE TO
REFINE MY WRITING PROCESS OR MY FIC IS DOOMED!</p><P>WOE IS ME! WOE IS ME!
WOE IS ME!</p><P>…</p><P>okay enough of that.
Anyways, Get a load of my T or H thing guys and gals! If you couldn't
figure it out before, the T or H actually stood for Ikegata Tomo or
Gekkou Hayate. Now, now, listen. As far as Tenten's surname goes…
I don't know where this came from. It's somewhere in the back of
my subconscious and I FRIGGIN KNOW I got it from somewhere, but for
the life of me I can't remember…'hits self with spatula' damn
it. Anyways…thanks for all the support and reviews. It's a real
kick to reach the 100+ mark with reviews. I'm hoping someday to top
a 1,000. Oh well… dreams..</p><P>And now, for some
speculation…</p><P>I'm just curious
what you guys think I'm going to do with this little character
interaction? Granted, I've already got the whole thing planned out…
but for those of you who remember how they got along in ch.1 …..I
think things will prove to be interesting… 'Thunder and lightning
in background' BWA HA HA HAH ! BWA HA HA HA HAH!</p><P>Yeah.</p><P>I guess this is the
madnarutofan signing off.</p><P>PEACE!</p>
