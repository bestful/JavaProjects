the Kyuubi's attack, and the Yondaime, Arashi Uzumaki, was watching
his darling wife, Hotaru, sleep.</p><P>A good friend of his,
Hyuuga Hizashi, walked into the hospital room where Arashi's wife
lay, sleeping, & pregnant.</p><P>Hizashi tapped Arashi
on the shoulder, effectively getting his friend and leader's
attention.</p><P>"Arashi, come on you
need to get all you gear by the village gate; ALL of it. The Kyuubi
is coming tomorrow." Arashi nodded, his eyes still on the beautiful
woman sleeping in front of him.<p></p><P>Hizashi knew that
Arashi wondered what would happen to his wife and unborn child, whom
they would name Naruto, if it was a boy, and if it was a girl,
Haruhi, or another nice name.</p><P>Hizashi, who cared
about his life-long friend and village leader, dragged said leader by
the ear towards Arashi's house, helping him collect all his
important weapons, stuff, and gear.</p><P>After they put their
assorted ninja gear into piles with their names on them by the North
Gate, Hizashi bid the Yondaime farewell and they headed their
separate ways: Hizashi to the Hyuuga clan complex, and Arashi headed
to the hokage's office on the other side of the village, to think
about the destruction and death that would come about tomorrow.</p><P>He contemplated what he
would do when the powerful demon, known as the Kyuubi no Kitsune (1),
headed toward his village. The Yondaime knew he might have sacrifice
his life to protect the village and the family he loved. He had a
technique that he read about in the ancient Scroll of Sealing that,
if worst came to worst, would seal the mighty demon away. As he
drifted off to sleep, he knew he would willingly die to keep his
village & family safe.</p><P>Still, he couldn't
help but think about his unborn child, and his wife, who he may never
see again.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Uzumaki Arashi woke up
with a start. It was raining outside his cold, dark office. He looked
around to see who, or what, woke him up.</p><P>It was then he saw his
friend and former sensei, the Toad Hermit, Jiraiya. He was grinning,
a maniacal grin not usually directed towards him, and he wasn't
sure of the reason it <I>was</I> directed towards him.</p><P>Arashi, never one to
beat around the bush, put it bluntly.</p><P>"What's wrong with
your face, Ero-sennin???"</p><P>"Look at your head
kid."</p><P>Arashi shook his head,
causing a small orange book to fall from its place on the top of his
head. He grinned sheepishly as Jiraiya stared at him, starting to
laugh maniacally.</p><P>"AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA!!!!
AND YOU SAID YOU WOULD NEVER READ MY BOOKS!!! DOES HOTARU KNOW???"</p><P>Jiraiya, still
laughing, waited for his former student to answer.</p><P>"Yes, and she's
okay with it, just like I'm fine with her reading yaoi manga. Now,
is there any REAL reason you woke me, Ero-sennin?"</p><P>The sannin stopped
laughing, his face becoming stern and serious, and he faced his
attentive ex-student.</p><P>"It's here."</p><P>"The Kyuubi?!"</p><P>The Yondaime was up
instantly, walking towards his closet. He pulled open the mahogany
doors, revealing a battle outfit consisting of a flak vest, a cotton
over-shirt with an iron mesh outside, a pair of titanium bracers, and
the Yondaime's white and red ANBU fox-mask.</p><P>After pulling the
armor, he glanced over to his mentor and friend, Jiraiya. He was
getting ready and making sure he had all his scrolls and kunai and
stuff.</p><P>Then, nodding to
Jiraiya, he headed outside the Hokage's Tower, noticing a dark
shape forming in the distance.</p><P>He stopped Jiraiya
after a while.</p><P>"Hold on; I need to
see her one last time, before I fight what may be my last battle. It
won't be more than ten minutes." Arashi said almost distantly. He
wandered over to the hospital, summoning three scrolls, each of which
carried the Yondaime's seal, a fox with the symbol of Konoha
instead of the eyes. He entered the empty hospital, walking to his
wife's room.</p><P>His kind eyes swept
over the machines in the room, noting that his unborn son, Naruto,
would be born in a few hours.</p><P>He set the three
scrolls down by the machine, one labeled '<I>To Naruto'</I>,<I>
'To Hotaru'</I>, and the last labeled <I>'To Konoha â€“ THIS IS
A LAW!'</I></p><P>He walked over to his
wife, sleeping peacefully, and knew that she would miss him, but was
sure she would make it through the night.</p><P>He walked over to her,
staring at her peaceful form. He stroked her long blonde hair,
causing her to wake up.</p><P>She smiled at him as
she asked, "Is it here?"</p><P>"Yes, and I might
have to sacrifice my life to save this village."</p><P>"I know. This may be
the last time I see you. Anyway, how are you going to defend the
village, Arashi-kun?"</p><P>"I know you might not
like it, but I have developed a jutsu that will turn the kyuubi into
a newborn child. Will you look after the Kyuubi-child and Naruto as
if they were brothers? Will you do that for me Hotaru-Chan? His name
will be Kyu."</p><P>His wife looked
thoughtful, then her face changed to one of grim determination.</p><P>"Yes, I will."</p><P>"I want you to know
that if you die, Naruto must read this scroll." Said Arashi,
gesturing to the one labeled 'To Naruto.'</p><P>Arashi looked at his
wife again, saying, "And if I don't make it, you need to read
that scroll and give that scroll to the new Hokage, Sarutobi-san."</p><P>At that point, Jiraiya
walked in, and motioned Arashi to leave.</p><P>The Yondaime looked at
his wife, and gave her the biggest kiss he could muster. It was
filled with longing, passion, and seemed like a sort of farewell.</p><P>"I'm sorry to
leave, Hotaru-chan, but I must. The fate of the Land Of Fire depends
on me."</p><P>"Do your best,
honey."</p><P>They both disappeared
in a poof of flame and smoke.</p><P>Off in the distance, a
large rumbling was heard, and a cheer rose from those who were
defending the village of Konoha from the Nine-tailed monstrosity that
was the Kyuubi no Kitsune.</p><P>Thousands of Leaf-nin
cheered as the Hokage and the Legendary Toad Hermit arrived a top
Gamabunta, the Toad Boss.</p><P>As the Yondaime got
everyone's spirits up, he and Jiraiya looked over the destruction
caused by the Kyuubi. He frowned at the damage; it would take them
YEARS to get back to their glory.</p><P>He looked up at the
blood-red-fur of the Kyuubi, now knowing for sure he would have to
die to save the village.</p><P>He grinned; he had one
hell of a battle ahead of him. It would be VERY fun.</p><P>He gestured to the
Kyuubi, looking at Jiraiya then Gamabunta in turn.</p><P>"Let's party." He
said, grinning his fox smile. (A/N: it's in his genes.)</p><P>HELLO!!! this is xan.tanuki here.
