Taking a mid-afternoon stroll?" A ten year old Naruto shouted at his inner captive. Naruto had known about his fuzzy prisoner for several years now. The fox had revealed herself to him, and her plan on forging him to be the perfect container. Well, she said she meant container but every so often he caught her saying Mate... At any rate, speculation as to the demon's feeling for him were currently forgotten as he ran from a small drunk, angry, shinobi filled mob. Birthdays were such a pain... The rest of the year they just ignored him, but every year on the anniversary of the Kyuubi attack some drunk mob thought it was a good idea to go on a demon hunt.</p><p>That brings Naruto to his current dilemma, running through a back alley with an armed mob on his heels. <b>"Dammit! Duck now!" </b>Naruto dropped, dodging a hail of shuriken, he grunted though, as one slashed it's merry way through his hamstring, a burst of red blood and chakra following it, healing the wound. <b>"Kit, healing you is NOT my idea of fun!"</b></p><p>"Oh shut up! Your not the one they're trying to make into shiskabob!" Naruto yelled back at his tenant as he jumped over a kunai. He whirled around another corner, hoping to escape his pursuers. However the color drained from his face when he saw a second mob waiting for him. This was definitely an unpleasant new twist. "Well fuck me."</p><p>()()()()()()</p><p>In the Hokage tower, Sarutobi Hiruzen paced in his office, his normal nemesis paperwork forgotten. "Naruto my boy... Where are you?" He had learned to keep the young jinchuuriki within eyesight on his birthday. He had sent one of his best ANBU operatives, Inu, to pick up the young Uzumaki. But the blond had not been at his apartment, that was never a good sign. A golden flash of light drew his attention to the horizon. He narrowed his eyes, there was something familiar about that...</p><p>()()()()()()</p><p>-5 minutes earlier-</p><p>"<b>FUCK FUCK FUCK." </b>Kyuubi screamed from her cage, all 9 tails swishing about her enraged form. Outside the seal her container was laying on the ground, doing his best to color the cement blood red. <b>"Damn you Naruto! I refuse to let all that work I've put into you go to waste." </b>She growled, she had invested to much emotionally into this boy to lose him now. She ran through options in her head until she settled on one, it wasn't her first or favorite option, but the process involved would release her from the seal and heal her host. <b>"Fuck it... I suppose sharing beats losing him... And dying, right cause that would suck to to." </b>Behind the bars of her damp cell her form shrank, a harsh red light consuming the mental landscape until a tall redhead with blood red hair, fox ears and a few tails was left. She dug a nail into her palm, wincing slightly as she ran through an ancient set of hand seals...</p><p>"<b>Blood Flesh Bone Death Life Love Life Soul Joy Lust Hate Blood Soul Love."</b> The demonic voice called out throughout the area, causing many of the drunk mob to wet themselves, they stared at the dying blond before them as he was consumed in a burst of golden energy. <b>"Dimension Technique: World Binding Souls no Jutsu!" </b>The golden energy burst forth, consuming the entire area in a nova of activity before eventually collapsing in on itself.</p><p>Sarutobi, the vaunted Hokage of Konohagakure could only stare on as he arrived at the scene as 4 forms of golden energy died down, one of them revealed a now fullyNaruto, though the Sandaime did notice a few things different, his hair had a slight, almost ethereal glow to it, and more while the whiskers on the right side of his face had deepened, the ones on the left side had disappeared altogether, in their place was an odd black tribal design of a wing. With his shirt burned off it was also easy to see what looked like a black barbed wire tattoo running around and down his right arm. The boy groaned slightly and rolled over into the lap of one of the other figures.</p><p>This one the Sandaime knew who it was almost instantly, from the burning red eyes, the blood colored hair, and the three swishing fox tails behind her body. The dark red, almost black, kimono she was wearing hugged her shapely form perfectly, she gave the Sandaime a fanged smile before looking down at the shivering blond in her lap. Her gaze softened as she ran a hand down his cheek, frowning a little at the black wing like mark on his face. The young blond instantly stopped shivering, instead choosing to curl closer into the red haired goddess. The woman looked up from the boy and gazed into the stunned crowd. Her eyes hardened, as her gaze turned cruel, she lifted her unoccupied hand. <b>"Burn." </b>In a flash crimson flames consumed the people who had assaulted the young Naruto. This act awakened, and drew the attention of the two remaining figures.</p><p>Seras Victoria, had been having a very odd day. She had been assigned to hunt down a rogue vampire, a rare solo mission for her. She had had the monster in her sights when this odd golden energy seemingly consumed her world, the next thing she knew she was on the ground, in some strange place, with people who she didn't know around, speaking Japanese of all things. Which oddly enough she had no problem understanding. But the weirdest thing, was upon a brief self inspection, she appeared to be around 15 years of age. She lifted a hand to feel the comforting weight of her Harkonnen rifle. She was about to ask where the hell she was, and why she felt an odd attraction to the young blond sitting in the red headed womans lap when she was beaten to the figurative punch.</p><p>"WHERE THE FUCK AM I?" Hiyori Sarugaki wasn't a friendly person under the best of circumstances. Being kidnapped by a strange blast of golden energy was not helping her mood. Especially since it appeared to have dropped her into a puddle. Filled with Blood. Well, at least her tracksuit's color hid the crimson blood fairly well.</p><p>The fox eared woman looked at the two new arrivals. <b>"Both blond. Figures..." </b>She put on her best 'I'm not going to eat your soul' smile, and turned to the pair of blond females, <b>"I believe I can answer you questions, thought it would be best to do so in a place with more privacy." </b>She turned to the still stunned Sandaime,<b> "I believe you can help there Hokage-san."</b></p><p>Blinking Sarutobi nodded, made a few <u>Kage Bunshins</u> and had one each grab a girl and perform a <u>Shunshin</u> into his office.</p><p>()()()()()()</p><p>The five figures arrived in a swirl of leaves in the Sandaime's office. A quick set of hand seals and a brief blue glow around the room signified the privacy seals had been activated. Kyuubi turned towards the other two women in the room, as they both fund chairs to sit in. She herself was sitting on the couch, Naruto still curled up in her lap. <b>"I believe you two have questions?"</b></p><p>Unsurprisingly Hiyori was the first to answer, "Damn straight I do! Where the hell am I? How the hell did I get here?"</p><p>Kyuubi held up a tail silencing the small blond, she turned to Seras, <b>"I presume your questions are the same?" </b>The young-ish, vampire nodded. <b>"Very well, my name is Kira, most in this world know me as Kyuubi no Kitsune. I used an ancient technique as a last ditch effort to save my chosen mate." </b>She indicated Naruto with a nod of her head, <b>"What this technique does is traverse the dimensional void, looking for suitable... Companions if you will. It then uses parts of their souls to help mend the targets, binding them all together. I assume you two were chosen because your souls were the most compatible, and your abilities the most useful for ensuring young Naruto here's survival. In the process I have sacrificed my own power as the medium binding your souls. Where I was once 9 tails, I gave 2 to each of you, leaving me 3."</b></p><p>Seras raised her hand, and Kira rolled her eyes. The vampire took that to mean she could ask her question. "So, were bound to that boy?"</p><p>"<b>Yes."</b></p><p>"Is there a way for us to get back from where we came from?" She asked tentatively.</p><p>"<b>No. To my understanding of the technique copies of yourselves were left in your place, or vice versa... At any rate you are hear for good now."</b></p><p>Hiyori scowled, "So I'm stuck here bound to this chibi?"</p><p>Kira raised an eyebrow, <b>"And who are you to call someone chibi?"</b> The elegant kitsune snickered as Hiyori's face burned red. <b>"Fear not... His is a life meant for interesting things. Especially if he has this..." </b>She said, looking again at the black wing on the sleeping child's face.</p><p>Sarutobi coughed, "If I may ask a question..." Kira nodded, "So, are you still bound to him?"</p><p>Kira sighed, <b>"I said as much didn't I? My fate is entwined with his just as much as it was first. Only now I can express myself far more... Physically." </b>She gave a perverse giggle on par with Jiraiya at that. The others stared at her. <b>"What? I've looked into his genetic code, I know more or less what he's going to look like as he gets older, and I'm laying claim to his virginity now."</b></p><p>Sarutobi sighed and rubbed his forehead. "What is with that mark then?"</p><p>Kira became serious, looking down again at the blond boy that had captured her heart. <b>"It signifies he had died Hokage-San. His soul belonged to the Shinigami when I used the technique. The fact he still lives means that fickle God has taken an interest in young Naruto and has given him his mark. Not necessarily a bad thing... But it is doubtful he will ever have a peaceful life. All previous receivers of this mark have led lives that changed the world... The last one that I can think of was called the Rikudo Sennin."</b></p><p>Sarutobi's eyes went wide, "Hmm, I always knew little Naruto-Kun would be special... May I ask Kira-Sama what your plans are?"</p><p>She glared at him, <b>"As much as I would like to say that after burning this place to the ground we would be leaving... For Kami knows why, Naruto loves it here. So here we shall stay. I want a secluded compound to stay in though as I feel people would not take well to my presence."</b></p><p>The Hokage nodded and glanced towards Seras and Hiyori, "I suppose you two will go with them."</p><p>Seras merely nodded while Hiyori sneered, "Not like I have a choice at the moment."</p><p>Sandaime nodded then fished through his desk, pulling out a sealing scroll with the Uchiha fan on it. He tossed it to the Kyuubi who caught it and looked at him puzzled. "The keys, deed and other things needed to get into the Uchiha compound. Young Sasuke has not lived there in sometime and no one else wishes to buy it... So it's yours. When Naruto wakes tell him it's a birthday present.</p><p>Kira smiled at the irony of her living in the Uchiha grounds. <b>"I imagine we will speak in the morning Hokage-San, until then." </b>With that she and the 3 blond's disappeared in a swirl of flame.</p><p>Sarutobi sighed as he slumped into his chair. He brought out a bottle of whiskey and volume of Icha Icha and groaned, taking a swig from the bottle. There would be more paperwork then the sands of Suna because f this, he could just tell.</p><p>()()()()()()</p><p>0</p><p>9</p><p>8</p><p>7</p><p>6</p><p>5</p><p>A/N: And so ends the prologue! Hope you all liked it so far... Hmm... Nope nothing to add here.</p><p>-I'll have pictures of the girls and of Naruto's tattoo in my profile soon! Gotta find them all again...-</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>A/N: And without
further ado here comes the second chapter of NPNC. Odd I'm updating
so fast you say? -glares at Killjoy- lets say I have some extra
motivation.</P><P>KEY:</P><P>"Normal Speech"</P><P><I>'Thinking'</I></P><P><I><B>'Demon Thinking'</B></I></P><P>"<B>Demon Speech"</B></P><P><U>Jutsu</U></P><P><I><B>Chapter 2</B></I></P><P>Naruto awoke slowly, his head pounding, his teeth aching, and the
rest of his body in general pain. He had dreamed the oddest thing...</P><P>Opening his eyes he immediately noticed the older woman sharing a bed
with him, with her long hair, whisker marks and tails... "Well fuck
me." He said softly so as not to awaken the former Kyuubi. He had
seen her human form a few times over the course of knowing her, and
seeing it up close and, ahem, personal caused a blush to creep up the
young boys face. All thought was lost as he stared at her, he could
hear her heart beating, pumping blood through her veins... He could
almost taste the sweet red liquid. He opened his mouth, revealing
large fangs, and stared hungrily at her wrist. Overwhelmed by
instincts he sunk his teeth into her veins sucking hard.</P><P>...</P><P>"<B>OW-
WHAT THE HELL?"</B>
Kira's rather vocal scream woke both Seras and Hiyori, leading them
to poke their heads from their room and find out what the commotion
was about. Across the hall, the door to Kira and Naruto's room was
flung open, <B>"All
right, I'm guessing one of you two is a vampire, or something like
that."</B></P><P>Seras raised her hand as she gawked at the odd sight. Naruto was
latched onto Kira's arm happily draining it of blood. "So that's
what you mean when it searches for people with useful abilities..."</P><P>Kira
nodded as she attempted to detach the blond haired leech. <B>"Indeed,
without me in his body he lost a rather useful healing ability. I'm
going to assume this touch of vampirism gives him a new one." </B>With
a nod from the blond female vampire Kira continued, <B>"I
imagine though, it would be without any weaknesses inherent to you.
From what I understand the jutsu only takes the best of one's
abilities and combines it with the target. Though, it isn't a one way
street, I can tell you've gained a chakra system, from Me no doubt,
and you've probably lost any weaknesses you may have had."</B></P><P>Seras raised an eyebrow at that, "No weaknesses huh?
Interesting..." She smiled in a way reminiscent of her, now
previous, master Alucard. Only briefly mind you... But long enough
for Kira to catch note of it.</P><P><I><B>'She's going to
be a fun one I just know it...' </B></I>Kira
turned towards Hiyori, <B>"And
you, What do you do?"</B></P><P>The Vizard sneered at Kira, "Not that matters to you, I'm a Vizard.
A soul reaper that has the powers of a hollow."</P><P>Kira
sighed, <B>"I have
no idea what that means... I trust your powerful though yes?"</B></P><P>Hiyori smirked and reached a hand up to the handle of the sword on
her back, "I dunno wanna test it out with your body?"</P><P>The
former Kyuubi laughed, <B>"Good
attitude... I trust your all fine staying here?"</B></P><P>"If
what you say is true I have no where else to go." Hiyori said,
dropping her hand back to her side. She sighed and looked at Naruto,
"Besides... I do feel some sort of pull to that kid, so I might as
well stick around."</P><P>"<B>You
feel the same way?" </B>
Kira said to Seras.</P><P>The blond vampiress nodded, "I do, I feel a stronger pull to him
then I did Master... So I suppose he will be my new Master."</P><P>Kira
shrugged, <B>"Whatever
works for you. But to help you understand a little more about who he
is... Here." </B>Her
tails raised up, and each one tapped the forehead of one of the other
girls, letting them see all that Kira had witnessed in Naruto's life.</P><P>Hiyori pulled back after the memory upload had finished, looking the
blond boy over with a more appraising eye. "He has a very strong
will for one so young... Maybe this won't be to bad after all."
Seras nodded in agreement.</P><P>It was around then Naruto finally detached himself Kira's arm. He
smiled as he wiped a trickle of blood from his lips. "Mmm,
perfectly spicy, with just a hint of sweetness." Kira raised an
eyebrow at that, and Seras laughed to herself. Naruto turned to the
other two women, "So... You are the other two my soul is bound to
huh? Not bad, could be far worse..."</P><P>Kira
raised an eyebrow, <B>"Wait,
you know? How do you know?"</B></P><P>Naruto smiled, baring his long fangs and touched the wing tattoo on
his face. "I was paid a visit last night in my dreams by the one
who gave me this. He explained everything to me... Even one of the
powers he gave me."</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>-Flashback to that Night-</P><P>Naruto blinked as his eyes opened taking scope of the landscape
around him. He recognized it as the sewer that once held Kyuubi, save
that it looked like someone got playful with explosive tags around
here. The bars of the cage had been blown apart, the twisted metal
scattered across the damaged sewer line. Everywhere he looked there
were pockets, and flare ups f this odd golden energy. It felt
something like chakra, but also... more.</P><P>"<B>Ahem."
</B>Naruto
whirled around at the sound of the voice to find a particularly well
dressed man standing there. He had spiky black hair, a dark pinstripe
suit, a cane, monocle and top hat.</P><P>"Who
the hell are you?" Naruto asked without thinking.</P><P>The
figure shrugged, <B>"I'm
what you mortals call Shinigami. My friends, theoretically, call me
Death."</B></P><P>"I'm
talking to Death..."</P><P>"<B>Indeed."</B></P><P>Naruto paused, as an awkward silence crept up. "Talking to Death...
Doesn't seem like a good thing to me.</P><P>Death
shrugged, <B>"Normally
it's not. However in your case you will find it to be most
fortuitous. After all It is because I allowed it you are still
alive." </B></P><P>Naruto cringed at that, flashes of him bleeding out onto the ground
going through his head. "So I uh, Died huh?"</P><P>Death
nodded, <B>"Yup. You
were dead, as a door nail. Dead as roadkill, dead as William Shatners
acting career."</B></P><P>"Wait
what?"</P><P>"<B>Umm,
never mind. The point is when your fuzzy little girlfriend did her
cute little technique, you were mine. I allowed it to work." </B>He
smirked at that, leaning on his cane.</P><P>"So
I suppose that begs the question why did you allow it work?" Naruto
asked.</P><P>"<B>Whim
mostly, I have seen how your life should have played out... But now?
Now it should be far more interesting. Far more... Entertaining."
</B>He
cackled at that.</P><P>"So
that's what my life is? Entertainment?" Naruto scrunched up his
face at that.</P><P>"<B>Aye,
and with 3 soon to be girlfriends, in a couple years it's sure to be
XXX rated entertainment." </B>Death
giggled perversely before straighting up. <B>"But
hey don't look so down, it beats being dead doesn't it?"</B></P><P>Naruto paused and tipped his head to either side before nodding, "You
have a point I guess. Say, can you tell me why I feel so...
Different?"</P><P>Death's
grin grew larger, <B>"Oh
you've become an interesting being. You've become part vampire, part
soul reaper, you have access to part of Kyuubi's chakra still, and I
might add you'll be able to use it a lot easier now that it's been
limited to 2 tails worth. Plus you have my little gifts."</B></P><P>"And
what are your gifts?" Naruto said, still mulling over the whole
vampire thing.</P><P>"<B>Well
this golden energy you see around you is a combination of chakra, and
reiryoku, the spiritual energy of the dead. Plus a little bit of
extra... It's what's replaced your chakra system. As for what else
I've given you..." </B>He
chuckled here and motioned Naruto closer, <B>"All
has to do with your left eye..."</B></P><P>-flashback end-</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>"<B>So
what does your eye do?" </B>Kira
asked impatiently, looking down at Naruto.</P><P>The blond smiled mischievously. "Oh, that's a secret... All I'll
tell you is it has three levels... He also mentioned I would get a
zanpakuto eventually, and to talk to Hiyori-chan when I do."</P><P>The blond Vizard nodded slightly at that. "All right... He said you
have reiryoku? I can teach you how to use that until you get your
sword then."</P><P>Seras nodded in agreement, "And I will teach you how to use your
vampiric abilities."</P><P>"<B>I'll
teach you everything you need to know about chakra... And pleasing a
woman." </B>She
cooed seductively wrapping a tail at him. She could feel the glares
of the other 2 women on her, she sighed loudly. <B>"Fine
dammit I'll wait until he's older for that." </B>They
both nodded, <B>"But
not much older..." </B>She
giggled like a certain Gama Sennin at a hot spring at the image. The
blonds just sighed.</P><P>Naruto looked around, "Where the hell are we anyways?"</P><P>Kira
smiled at the young blond, <B>"Sandaime
called it a late birthday gift. We are now the proud owners of the
Uchiha Compound."</B></P><P>Naruto whistled in appreciation at that. "Whoa... That's nice. I
remember this place being huge." He paused, then got a huge grin.
"Lets go explore the place!" He jumped up and dashed out the
door, clad in nothing but his slightly shredded pants. The 3 girls
chuckled at the young boy's antics and followed him out.</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>An hour later the small group was back at the original location
discussing future plans for the compound when they heard a knock at
the door. Naruto ran over and opened it revealing the Sandaime,
"Jiji!" He said tackling the elderly man in a hug.</P><P>Sarutobi smiled and patted the young boy in the head. "Hello
Naruto... I brought you a new set of clothes." He said pulling out
a small package.</P><P>"Sweet!"
Naruto smiled at the man before dashing into the bedroom to try them
on.</P><P>The aged Hokage looked fondly at Naruto before turning to the three
women, "Come let's sit and talk." He said motioning to the living
room. The girls nodded and followed him in each sitting down. "Now
then... I suppose I would ask what your plans are?"</P><P>Hiyori
and Seras looked at Kira who sighed, apparently being nominated group
speaker. She glanced coldly at the Hokage, <B>"We
are staying in Konoha. I believe Naruto would like to remain in the
academy and eventually become a ninja of this village. He no doubt
still wants your hat." </B></P><P>Sandaime chuckled at that. "It is my dearest hope to give it to him
one day. But how about the rest of you?"</P><P>Kira
looked at the other two girls who both nodded at her. <B>"In
the books you can sign us as a provisional squad. Not official
shinobi as such... But we will task ourselves to the protection of
Naruto. Maybe other tasks that may require us. In the long run... We
would like to apply to start a clan once Naruto is older."</B></P><P>Hiruzen nodded, "It'll be difficult... But it will be done."</P><P>"<B>Also,
any attempts on our lives will be met with deadly force." </B>She
glared at him, her ruby eyes sparkling with ferocity, <B>"That
is non-negotiable. AM I understood?"</B></P><P>The Hokage could feel the cold sweat the ran down his back when she
said that, and he was once again reminded of her once held status as
strongest demon. "All right..." They paused when the heard the
bedroom door fly open.</P><P>Naruto burst into the room and tackled Sarutobi in a flying glomp.
"Thank you for the clothes!" He said stepping back allowing
everyone a better look at him. He was wearing black cargo pants, a
black muscle shirt and over that was a black military vest with the
symbol of Konoha stitched onto the back in gold. Kira liked her lips
as she imagined the older version of him wearing that. Having seen
the image in Kira's memory, Seras and Hiyori also smiled imagining
the older version of him.</P><P>Sarutobi sweat dropped at the sight. He shook it off and looked at
Naruto. "Shall we get you to the academy now?"</P><P>Naruto nodded happily, "I can't wait to show off my new clothes!"</P><P>It was at this point Seras spoke up, "Umm how are you going to
explain his glowing hair?"</P><P>Naruto glanced at the Hokage who just shrugged. "Meh, emerging
bloodline. It's almost true after all." They all nodded at that.
"Now come on Naruto."</P><P>Naruto smiled as he followed the Sandaime out of the house. "Bye!
See you guys later!" He called happily to the three girls.</P><P>The three girls smiled and watched as Naruto left. A few minutes
later Hiyori frowned. "Now what the hell are we gonna do?"</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>At the academy Iruka was watching the students come in, a worried
look on his face. Last night was Naruto's birthday and he hoped the
young boy made it out fine. His worries were dispelled with a cry of
"Iruka-sensei!" He smiled as he heard Naruto yell, his eyes
widened however as he caught sight of the blond. The odd new tattoo
marks, new clothing and was his hair glowing?</P><P>"Hey
Naruto, now go take your seat class is just about to start." He
watched as the blond smiled all the way to his seat at all the stares
he was getting. Iruka looked and saw the Sandaime watching outside
the window. Guess whatever happened to Naruto wasn't to bad then...</P><P>...</P><P>Naruto just smirked at the looks he was getting, he never got
attention like this before. He saw Sasuke looking at him and he
smirked. The Uchiha boy snorted, "What happened to you Dobe?"</P><P>Naruto shrugged, "Awakened a bloodline. Cool huh?"</P><P>"Tch,
I doubt it's anything special compared to the Sharingan." Sasuke
snorted out, indignant that the Dobe had managed to awaken a
bloodline.</P><P>Naruto shrugged, "Who knows. Shame you can't activate your to find
out."</P><P>Sasuke glared, "Why you..."</P><P>He was interrupted by Iruka, "All SHUT UP. Class is starting. Now
turn to page..." Sasuke grunted as the scarred Chunnin started to
drone on. Naruto was nothing special... Not compared to him. Well,
we'll let the Uchiha to his own delusions.</P><P>The rest of the class, specifically many of the girls, were looking
at Naruto in a new, more stalk worthy light. Poor boy eh?</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>0</P><P>9</P><P>8</P><P>7</P><P>6</P><P>5</P><P>A/N: And thus ends chapter 2! Got that out fast eh? Hope you guys

chapter 3 already... Holy crap... Whats up with that? It's like
I'm... Motivated or something.</P><P>KEY:</P><P>"Normal Speech"</P><P><I>'Thinking'</I></P><P><I><B>'Demon Thinking'</B></I></P><P>"<B>Demon Speech"</B></P><P><U>Jutsu</U></P><P><I><B>Chapter 3</B></I></P><P>2
years passed, and life had changed drastically for Naruto. First off
he dressed much, much better. This produced it's own set of problems,
in the form of fangirls. His two biggest fans, were Hyuuga Hinata,
and Yamanaka Ino. Mind you, he had to respect the ones that stuck
with him, especially after the brutal beat down Hiyori had laid on a
girl who got a little to frisky with Naruto a few months after she
arrived. That was one of the other changes, both Seras and Hiyori had
recognized their own attraction to the young blond, and the Vizard
was fiercely territorial, so to speak.</P><P>There
was only one attack on the small family. One that was brutally put
down by a madly grinning Kira. Due to the lack of survivors, the rest
of the village still doesn't realize the Kyuubi they all hate is out
of it's seal. Oh well, ignorance is bless after all.</P><P>Naruto's
skills had sky rocketed from what they were, he was proficient enough
with hand to hand combat, more so then most people, but less then say
a student of Maito Gai. He more then made up for that with his
vampire strength and regeneration, the hits he did score were always
devastating. But where he truly shined, and his overall favorite
thing, was a gift from Seras and the Hokage. A pair of guns, altered
to fire chakra bullets. You channeled chakra into the weapon and it
split it into different elemental types for different effects. Wind
chakra made shredder rounds, water chakra produced rounds with a
similar effect as a rubber bullet, fire chakra produced incendiary
rounds, lightning rounds produced a shock equivalent to your standard
taser, and earth chakra produced a deep penetrating rounds. His
weapons of choice? A massive coal black 'pistol' based off Seras'
previous Master's Jackal pistol, except it had in stylized gold
lettering 'Atreides' written on the side. His other weapon was based
after a Winchester Model 1894 lever action shotgun. It, like the
pistol was coal black, in gold writing on the side was 'Corrino'.</P><P>Needless
to say those were his favorite weapons. He still hadn't managed to
gain his zanpakuto, but he was a little to gun crazed to care. He had
taken to using a few of the more destructive Hado spells Hiyori had
shown him. I mean, who doesn't like the idea of shooting glorious
exploding death from your hands?</P><P>Sasuke
still looked down on Naruto, but that wasn't surprising. The blond
boy was about middle in the class marks wise, he aced his practicals
but his book work didn't do so well. Let's face it, it's Naruto,
he'll never be book smart. Mind you the Uchiha would probably respect
Naruto a bit more if he watched the blond go at someone with those
guns of his, then drink their pooled blood. I mean, that's just a
sight you can't not respect. Or it'll haunt your dreams for life.
Needless to say living with a former Demon Queen, Vampire, and an
irate Vizard the blond boy had turned out a little unbalanced,
leaning heavily towards excessive and brutal violence. Well, he
didn't go around kicking puppies or anything, he just had a short
fuse and a hair trigger paired with high caliber weaponry.</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>The day of the gennin
exam, was irritatingly sunny in Naruto's opinion. That could just
have been remnants of his vampire weaknesses, but he figured he just
wasn't a morning person. He paused to shoot a rather irritating song
bird outside of his window, lest it attract others and cause a
musical number to happen. He'd seen it done before, twice. He glanced
outside at the former Uchiha grounds and smiled. Many of the houses
had been destroyed, only 3 buildings remained. The main Uchiha manor
which was quite large, easily fitting into the mansion size, another
heavily reinforced building that served as a bunker, weapons storage
and maintenance and a rather large jutsu library taken from the
Uchiha's. The last building was a large dojo. The rest of the area
had been converted into a scenic park and forest.</P><P>The blond smiled as he
rolled out of bed and headed sleepily into the hallway towards the
kitchen. He made it about halfway there when a soft and fuzzy red
tail coiled around him, drawing him in between one of the nicest pair
of breasts he'd ever had the pleasure of seeing. <B>"Good morning
Naruto-kun, sleep well?"</B></P><P>Naruto
smiled as he rubbed Kira's tail, "I did."</P><P>"<B>Today's the big
day huh?" </B> She asked, running
a soft hand down his cheek.</P><P>Naruto
was about to answer when he was interrupted by a loud irritating
shout. "OI! No molesting him until he's older! Those are the
rules!" Hiyori yelled, swiping at Kira with a large frying pan.</P><P>Kira
snorted in indignation, but backed away all the same. She shrugged,
<B>"After today he becomes a gennin, which makes him an
official adult, that makes him a perfectly molestable target."</B></P><P>Hiyori
sneered, "That's tonight, this is now. So paws off the goods!"</P><P>"<B>Pfft, your just
jealous your the third favorite." </B>Kira
said, smiling cruelly as she snatched a strip of bacon from the
stove.</P><P>"I'm
WHAT?!? At least I don't feel so desperate I need to throw myself at
him every chance I get you three tailed whore!" Hiyori yelled back.</P><P>Kira's
eye twitched, <B>"What did you say you zero height flat
chested monkey?"</B></P><P>"I'll
FUCKING KILL YOU BITCH!" Hiyori screamed and lunged at Kira. The
fox demon snarled and dropped into combat stance.</P><P>"BOTH
OF YOU SHUT UP AND SIT DOWN!" Naruto hollered at the pair, causing
them to freeze. He sighed and walked between the two, cupping
Hiyori's cheek in one hand, and taking Kira's hand in the other. "You
know I love you girls all equally yes?" They both nodded, "Good.
Now say your sorry."</P><P>"Sorry...
Whore."</P><P>"<B>Sorry... Midget."</B></P><P>They
both stared at each other and started growling again. "GIRLS!"
They both looked sheepish and turned away embarrassed, tossing out a
mumbles sorry each. "Now you two play nice while I go give
Sera-chan her breakfast and get dressed. They both grumbled while
grabbing breakfast and sitting on opposite ends of the kitchen
glaring silently at each other. Naruto just threw up his hands and
sighed before grabbing two helpings of eggs and bacon, along with a
pack of blood from the freezer before heading upstairs. He knocked
lightly on Seras' room.</P><P>A
muffled "C'mon in." Was heard as he slipped into the room. Naruto
smiled at the sleepy form of the female vampire. He set one plate of
food down before tossing her the pack of blood.</P><P>"Here,
something to wake you up." After all when your out of coffee blood
works as a great substitute. Naruto chuckled as Seras, clad in a
fuzzy bat pajamas, pounced on the packet, sucking it dry with a
contented look on her face. "Better now?"</P><P>Seras
nodded with a smile on her face before motioning for one of the
plates of food. "Was a little watery, but all together not to bad.
Bacon looks good."</P><P>"Thank
Hiyori-chan for that. And well, it wasn't like I could go out and
grab a fresh young virgin..." They both paused at the thought, a
small trickle of drool running from the corner of their mouths.
Vampire thing.</P><P>"So
your test is today right?" Seras asked between bites of the food.</P><P>Naruto
nodded as he cleaned up his plate. "Yup, I gotta be there in..."
He glanced at the clock beside Seras' bed. "Fuck... 25 minutes."
He jumped up and gave the teenage looking girl a quick peck on the
cheek before dashing out of the room. "Seeya afterwards Sera-chan!"</P><P>Seras
stared after him, a small blush on her face. "Good luck Naruto."
She whispered quietly as she finished her food.</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>20
minutes later Naruto stood outside the academy. His dress had changed
little in two years, just had the addition of a set of black, thin
leather wrappings on his arms coming up to his elbows. He dashed into
the classroom, minutes to spare. Iruka looked up at the noise,
glanced at the clock then Naruto before giving a slight nod in
approval.</P><P>The
blond flashed a smile back, before heading up to his usual seat
between Aburame Shino and Inuzuka Kiba. Between the creep factor from
Shino and Kiba's smell it was generally enough to keep fangirls away
from his immediate location. He watched as a few more students
trickled in before the buzzer went off. Iruka slammed a ruler onto
his desk instantly getting the attention of everyone in the class.
"All right, as you all know the Gennin test is today. We will start
off with a hundred question written test, you'll have 1 hour to
complete this..." As he spoke Mizuki handed out the test papers,
stopping to glare at Naruto who blissfully ignored him. "All right,
start!"</P><P>Naruto
glanced down at the paper and suppressed a cheer. <I>'Multiple
Choice! Score!' </I>Naruto
mentally cheered. An hour and much random dot filling later the class
moved outside for weapon testing.</P><P>Iruka sighed as he had the class line up, "All right, you have ten
targets, ten shots..." Naruto zoned out as his teacher droned on. I
mean, it was throwing sharp pointy objects at a target, not a hard
concept. He groaned as he watched student after student take their
sweet fricking time, all trying to pull of some sort of cool throw to
impress the class. It's not like they were being judged on style...</P><P>When it came to the Drama Queen's turn Naruto groan as Sasuke turned
and smirked at the blond, before he did a little wrist flick, thing,
and nailed 7 bulls eyes, the other 3 shots not being far from the
center. "That Dobe, is how you do it." Sasuke smirked and walked
over to the group of students who had finished. His fan girls ooo'd
and aww'd at the young Uchiha, swarming him as he approached.
Naruto's fangirls turned and looked at the blond expectantly.</P><P>Iruka sighed, just once could they not have a proverbial pissing
match? "All right Naruto your next."</P><P>The blond sighed and stepped up, his first 3 throws were all slightly
off center, extremely close to where Sasuke's had been. Naruto
smirked and walked onto the field and adjusted the last seven targets
so they were all in a row back to back. The class looked at him
puzzled as he walked back to the throwing line. He smiled and waved
to a few of his fangirls, causing many to faint, and the rest to
cheer.</P><P>After suitably wooing the audience, he picked up a kunai, weighed it
in his hand, reared it back and threw it with all his might. It tore
through the bulls eye of every target, embedding itself in a tree
several yards behind the throwing range. "That Teme, is how it's
done."</P><P>Sasuke glowered, "Still only counts as one."</P><P>Iruka groaned, figured Naruto would do something like this. "Well,
technically speaking it doesn't say anywhere you have to use all 10
throws to hit the targets, just that you have to hit ten targets,
which he did." Naruto smiled and stuck his tongue out at the
growling Uchiha.</P><P>Mizuki clapped his hands getting everyone's attention, after Ino had
gone of course, "All right, time for your Taijutsu exam. You have
two minutes to land a hit on Me in a spar."</P><P>The students did... All right. Most of them getting in just barely
under the two minute limit. Naruto narrowed his eyes as Mizuki went
far easier on Sasuke, and let the Uchiha get a hit 40 seconds in.
Mizuki got a strange light in his eyes as he motioned for Naruto to
step up. The young vampire smiled internally as the Chunnin dropped
into a far more serious combat stance. The vampire merely curled up
into a defensive stance and waited. Mizuki was good he would give him
that, but the silver haired man had nothing on vampire reflexes and
speed, 50 seconds into the 'spar' Naruto saw his chance, and
countered a hit with a viscous elbow to Mizuki's solar plexus,
knocking the examiner out of the ring, and out of breath.</P><P>Iruka sighed and shook his head, he was one of the few that knew
about Naruto, so he wasn't to surprised his partner got knocked out.
"All right, time to test your ninjutsu."</P><P>Naruto sighed at that, he wasn't that good with ninjutsu, none of the
people teaching him used it. Kira had simply taught him chakra
manipulation, and he wasn't quite willing to whip out a few of the
Hado spells Hiyori had taught him. He barely scraped by that portion,
making 3 somewhat lively clones, and suitably using a kawamari and
henge. Sasuke had beat him there, something that gave the Uchiha no
small amount of pride.</P><P>Iruka smiled, looking at all the graduates wearing their shiny new
hiate-ate, "All right class, tomorrow you'll be split into teams,
and we'll announce the rookie of the year."</P><P>As the class filed out, Naruto caught the disappointed look in
Mizuki's eyes as he walked by. The vampire smiled cruelly to himself,
his hunt tonight might just be a little fun...</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>(A/n: I almost ended it here, but that would be to cruel.)</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>Needless to say, when Naruto walked through the door to his home
wearing his headband Kira immediately pounced on the blond, cuddling
up to him. Hiyori started a screaming match with the red headed
kitsune while Naruto talked with Seras, who was wearing a proud smile
on her face. Internally Naruto beamed, 2 years ago he couldn't have
imagined how his life would turn out, and he was eternally grateful
to have the chance to have this, somewhat, family with him now.</P><P>As
the sun went down and the moon started to rise though, he smiled,
baring his large fangs. He went up to his room and grabbed the
Corrino and Atreides before opening up his window. The three girls
followed him and Kira looked at him strangely as he tied a black
bandanna over his glowing hair. <B>"Where
are you going?"</B></P><P>Naruto smiled as he shouldered the shotgun, and placed his obscenely
large handgun on hip holster. "Out hunting, I suspect theres worthy
prey out tonight."</P><P>Kira
sighed, <B>"Fine...
Just don't get blood all over your stuff, it's a pain to clean."</B></P><P>The vampire smirked, "As you wish..." And with a wave good bye he
silently dropped from the window, disappearing into the night.</P><P>...</P><P>Naruto silently crept through the tree tops in the forest, having
finally located his prey.</P><P>Mizuki was running hard, the forbidden scroll tucked underneath his
arm. He had to laugh to himself though, he had gotten it! A mere
Chunnin had managed to steal the forbidden scroll! He glanced at his
watch, it was an hour or so until he was to meet up with Orochimaru's
agent. He smiled and stopped, leaning against a tree. "Ha! Those
pathetic fools. I can't believe I got away so easily."</P><P>"Got
away from what so easily Mizuki-sensei?"</P><P>Mizuki froze and turned around to see the silhouetted form of Naruto
standing against a tree. "Naruto? What the hell are you doing
here?"</P><P>The blond slowly walked forward, a small grin played across his
features. "Oh... Just hunting."</P><P>Mizuki snarled, he couldn't let the boy leave here alive lest he told
a patrol where the Chunnin was. He then smirked, not that he hadn't
wanted to do this anyways... "Hey Naruto, wanna know a secret?"
The blond cocked his head in the darkness and nodded, "It's a
secret dealing with you, and the day you were born. You see, the
Yondaime didn't kill the Kyuubi, he sealed it! Into you Demon!"</P><P>Of all the possible reactions the Chunnin thought he would get, a
sharp laugh wasn't one of them. "That's it? I already knew that
fool." He un-shouldered the Corrino, and started to spin it in his
right hand. "And for your information, she both hasn't been sealed
in me for several years..." Mizuki gaped at that, "And I'm not a
demon... I'm a Vampire." He laughed loudly at that, his elongated
fangs glistening in the moonlight. He leveled the shotgun at Mizuki's
head. "Oh... And your dead." Click, BOOM.</P><P>Pieces of silver hair, brain matter and other assorted gore scattered
across the forest as the now headless body slumped to the ground.
Naruto walked over to the body, an almost lust filled look in his
eyes as he dipped his hand into the bloody remains of Mizuki's neck
and scooped some of the still hot blood into his mouth. He frowned
and narrowed his eyes slightly, "Bah, you barely know anything
interesting. Though, if you had a curse seal of Orochimaru's you
should have used it fool." He said, scowing at the corpse.
"Orochimaru... There's a man I want to eat... The knowledge stored
in him must be incredible." The vampire cackled to himself as he
cleaned the blood off his hands, licking it slowly. He picked up the
large scroll Mizuki had been carrying and opened it up to the first
entry. "Kage Bunshin huh? Sounds easy..."</P><P>An hour later Naruto started to walk out of the forest, dragging the
headless corpse with one arm, the scroll tucked under his other. A
few miles back towards Konoha he came across an injured Iruka, the
scarred Chunnin turned, and winced, "Run Naruto! Mizuki is some-"</P><P>"Dead."
Naruto deadpanned and lifted the corpse into view. Iruka flinched at
the sight. "C'mon, let's get you to s medic, then return this."
Naruto said, tossing the Forbidden scroll to his teacher, before
easily lifting the man with his now free hand. Together the pair
walked back towards Konoha for what was sure to be an interesting
debriefing...</P><P>()()()()()()</P><P>0</P><P>9</P><P>8</P><P>7</P><P>6</P><P>5</P><P>A/N: And now I'm done! Hope you enjoyed the chapter... The whole time
I was writing this I was listening to Ultimate Fight of Ultimate
Destiny. Plus it was really late when I started, and I've had a lot
of caffeine, so I hope that explains any weirdness/randomness.</P><P>Digital cookie goes to the person who figures out why I called
Naruto's guns what I did. Oh, any team suggestions? I'm still not
totally sure what I'm gonna do for them...</P>

my computer over and starting again. In the process killing so many
pages of writing.... I'm very pissed about that,</P><P>Very very VERY pissed
