was the dark of night when a dark shape leapt from shadow to shadow.
<I>'Almost there. Soon you'll be gone. Just a little farther.'
</I>The young boy clad in black thought to himself. Finally he
arrived at the gates, his freedom.</P><P>"What
goes there?" One of the guards asked. The black clad Genin smirked.
The last thing the two jonin saw was a pair of blood red eyes. He ran
out the gates before any alarms could be set off. The village was
quite pathetic. He was amazed that it had managed to survive all this
time. <I>'Oh well, that ends tonight.'</I> The figure kept
running without turning back. Finally he reached the meeting point.</P><P>"I
have a proposition for you." he called out.</P><P>"That
would be?" Asked the leader of the rogue ninjas.</P><P>"I
will give you what you want in exchange that you and the rest of your
group burn Konohakagure down to the ground."</P><P>"I
thought you wanted to be Hokage, Naruto-kun?" The infamous Uchia
Itachi asked with the trade mark Uchia smirk. The blond haired
jinjuriki gave a crazed smile that showed his pointy teeth.</P><P>"I
am only giving them what they wanted. They wanted a demon, now they
are getting one." he threw his head back and let free a demented
laugh.</P><P><U>In Naruto's

Naruto's genuine, 100 watt smiles was sent to the tall, pale man
with long blood red hair.</P><P><U>'<I>Don't

Kyuubi.'</U></I></P><P>'<I><B>Don't

the two longed to no longer have bars to separate them from one
another.</P><P>x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x</P><P>a\n:
don't ask me what that was because I have no idea I blame it on
lack of sleep and Snapple. Although I did want to write a dark
Naruto. I meant it to be an oneshot, but it has room for more
chapters. So if anyone wants to write a sequel or continue this story
let me know.</P>

of the Hunt</U></P><P>It was my fifth birthday and there was a large party. I had always
wanted to go, but the old man never let me go. So I snuck out and
went. I had so much fun until I was caught. The men were drunk and
larger than me. It was then that I knew I was different than everyone
else. That I was a demon. From that day on my nights were spent
cowering under my bed until the men would find me; and beat me. The
fact that I healed fast helped. I was strange, a monster or so they
told me. But how I got to this point wanting to kill had more to do
with my 'bonds' that I had then anything else.</P><P>During the days before I kicked Sasuke's ass and brought him home I
turned inward for comfort. Often escaping to my mindscape so I
wouldn't hear what was said about me, so I wouldn't see the
looks. I just wanted to flee from my life. I tried to kill myself
one, but I healed before it could work. Kyuubi was the only one
there for me. Slowly we built up a friendship; which soon became
something else. Something more. Kyuubi like any tailed-demon could
take a human form. He was tall and pale with waist length blood red
hair, his eyes are red with a slit for a pupil. He has long, claw
like nails and strong arms. I often would slip into his cage to be
held by them.</P><P>After
I brought Sasuke home people still blamed for his leaving and treated
me like I was the traitor. I would go to Kyuubi for comfort and love.
The day I finally found out a way to bring Kyuubi out Sakura ran over
to me shouting.</P><P>"Naruto,
Sasuke-kun is going to become Hokage. Isn't that great." At first
I was shocked then all I could see was red and Sakura was just
blabbering on. Apparently the council didn't think Tsunade was
doing a proper job anymore so they voted her out of office. The
villagers couldn't be happier to the sole Uchiha would be the
leader of the village. Leaving dashed and dreamless was a plus side. 
The night of Sasuke's coronation I left Konoha they never wanted me
and I didn't want them either. Not anymore.</P><P>Suddenly
a hand is on my shoulder pulling me out of my memories. I recognize
the pale hand it used to be Itachi's, but now it's Kyuubi's.
When I released him we need a body and Kyuubi liked Itachi's. He
was the first of the Akatsuki to die. We killed them slowly and
painfully. I enjoyed every minute of it. I get up from the pile of
dead bodies around me. I look behind me. I can still see the smoke
rising from the pile of rubble that once was Konoha. I take Kyuubi's
hand leaving behind a trail of smoke and destruction and walk with
him down the path of blood and death.</P><P>Xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>a\n:
