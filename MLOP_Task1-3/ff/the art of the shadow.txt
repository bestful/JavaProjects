As he was going out of the west gate, he made a promise, that one day he would exact his revenge on the village hidden the leaves. He would destroy every last person that ridiculed, despised, or hurt him in any way.</p><p>The first thing he needed to do was to get some new clothes, his trademark orange would be a dead giveaway. He went to one of the smaller villages and there he got an all black suite. While he was there, he did some research, and found the whereabouts of a rouge Nin from konaha by the name of aku kage (evil shadow), who was currently in the land of fire, looking for a job, usually as a hired assassin, or bodyguard. That night, naruto devised a plan to get the rouge Nin to be his apprentice. When he first ordered the room in the inn, the lady had asked him for his name, since naruto would give him away, he made up a new name, "m...my…my name, its Jigoku Gekido (hell's fury)." He stammered. The lady gave him some suspicious looks, but finally conceded and gave him the room key.</p><p>As aku kage along the forest, a boy dressed in all black, and with a konaha Nin headband with a slash through it on appeared in front of him, he said, "hay, kid get out of my way." The boy just stood there, then finally the boy said, "Would be my sensei, aku-san?" The man busted out laughing and said, "what gave you a crazy idea like that!?!?" The boy replied, "I need to get stronger so I can exact my revenge on the village hidden in the leaves." He stated. The man replied, "You are not worthy." Angry now, the boy shouted, "Want to bet, ill fight you right now!" the boy said as he launched a couple of kunai at the man. Aku kage caught the kunai in mid air and sent them back at the boy. They hit him, but he turned into smoke. Before he could analyze what happened, he heard "kage no bushi" and all of a sudden a hundred kids in black surrounded him, then together they said, "kage no bushi!" all of a sudden there was a thousand kids in black in the tree and on the ground, then one walked up to him and said, "want to reconsider that proposal?"</p><p>'Holy crap!' he thought 'this kid is pretty good, but not good enough' he thought. "Shi no kage!" (Death shadow) he shouted. All of a sudden he stepped into the shadow of one of the clones and vanished. The shadow clones started talking amongst themselves when aku kage suddenly appeared in the middle of the group. The second he appeared, the clones disappeared simultaneously, all of them destroyed. The real naruto jumped out of a tree while he was trying to figure out how he destroyed them all of them instantly, and without effort, when felt the cold steel of kunai against his throat. "Crap!!" he thought. "Where did you learn that jutsu, you aren't that old, and only jounine level have enough charka to create ten clones, let alone a thousand, but still you aren't good enough for me to train. "before naruto could protest, the kunai slit his neck, but to his surprise, his knife just sank into a piece of wood, before he could realize what happened he had four clones in front of him, four behind, and one on each side, all ten had a rasingan . "Bad idea kid, shi no kage!" he yelled, but nothing happened. "What the…" but naruto cut him off, "the sun is directly over our head, so I don't have a shadow, and since you have to use my shadow to suck the life out of me, you're jutsu won't work. " "All right, what do you want?" he asked. "all I want is for you to take me in as you're apprentice, and to teach me in the art of shadow, so I can exact my revenge on the village that scorned me for so long. "Ok, but what do I get in return?" he asked. "Well first of all," he said, "I wont give you disfiguring swirl-shape scars all over you're body, and second, I will offer my complete services in anything you do. He considered these to reasons, especially the first one, and finally said "ok."</p><p>A/N my first fanfic, please, constructive criticism, no flames. Not sure how many chappies this will be</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p align="center">Art
of the shadow</p><p align="center">A/N
<B>hi kuubi talking</B></p><P>Ch2:
defacing the monuments</p><P>"So
you know the shadow clone jutsu, but do you know any other shadow
jutsu?" Looking puzzled, Naruto answers, "No…hey, aren't we
headed towards Konaha, do you want to get caught?" Annoyed at his
little faith, Aku Kage says "How do you think I have evaded konaha
all these years? Konaha would never suspect me hiding near it, and
other villages would be too scared to sneak around Konaha for fear
that Konaha would suspect something and declare war on them."
Surprised, Naruto replies "Oh, so where are we going?" "Do you
know how to climb up trees by using charka in the soles of your
feet?" Aku asked. "Of course, but what does that have to do with
it?" replied Naruto. "I have to teach you a new jutsu Jigoku."
Aku said. "It's called kieru no kage jutsu. Watch." he said as
he stepped into the shadow of a tree. "Kieru no kage jutsu!" he
said and instantly vanished. A couple of seconds later, he appeared
in the shadow of a tree behind Naruto. "As long as there is a
shadow covering your body, you will be completely invisible, even
Beakuyagon can't see through this jutsu, nether can the sharingan,"
he said. What does this have to do with anything?" said Naruto. 
"Well, you will have to use it to get into the fourths nose."
"The fourths what!!!" "There is a secret door on the inside
of the fourths left nostril on the monument." No there isn't, I
would have noticed, I've been up there tones of times," argued
Naruto. "I know" says Aku, "you defaced them about five times
last year. What you failed to understand is that you have to make a
certain sign on the stone for it to open up. Even then, it will not
open unless it recognizes you're blood. Otherwise, I would have
been discovered years ago. I have a stockpile of weapons, clothes,
food, and other equipment there. When I run out, I just go into
Konaha and get some more stuff. The place is catacomb all through
the monument, and inside the first head is one big training ground."
 In absolute amazement, Naruto exclaims, "When do we leave?" Aku
shakes his head, "Not so fast! You must first learn jutsu. You
will need it to get to the doorway unseen." They spent the next
two days mastering kieru no kage jutsu. At first, he was only able to
make him self a little hazy. It didn't take long for him to get
better. After only two days, he was completely invisible. "All
right, its time to go." "Kieru no kage jutsu!" they said and
instantly disappeared. A couple of seconds later they appeared on the
inside of the fourths nose. Aku kage pulled out a kunai, cut his
index finger, made some strange symbols and a block of stone slid
back. "Memorize these symbols, as you will use them to get into
the hideout. Now, what is you're real name? You were excessively
quick to tell me your name in the forest. What is your real name
Jigoku Gekido?" Aku says in an irritated tone. "It's Naruto
Uzimaki," he said flatly as he walked inside. 'Don't<I>
trust this guy kit, he's bad news.' </I>
Narto knew Kit was right, but all he needed from him is the shadow
jutsu he knows. Then he could lose this guy. Narto whispers to the
fox demon as he marveled at the majesty of the catacombs, "I'll
probably end up having to take him out. However, with him, I can
fulfill my favor to the akutsu. I'll have to send for kisame to
pick him up." "All right Jigoku, go get some sleep. We will
start training tomorrow." Said aku kage, still in deep thought. 
"Hi, aku-sensei, see you tomorrow," and with that, he started
walking towards a hallway marked bedrooms. Slowly he walked to a
door that felt right, entered, and locked the door behind him. He
sat down in a meditative position on the bed. In deep meditation,
the gates of Kuubi appeared in front of him. "All right," Naruto
said, "you want to get revenge on konaha for imprisoning you? 
'<B>Yes, I want to
crush every one that hated and tried to scorn me. It was an accident
that I stumbled onto konaha, but nevertheless they attacked me, so,
naturally, I fought back.' </B>Narto
replies to Kuubi "I have found a way to make it look better in
here, but you have to promise me that you will train me so I can be
ready for when I have to get rid of Aku. Give me your word Kuubi,
that you will train me so I can take my revenge on the village of
konaha." '<B>Yes!
Yes I will.' </B>"Ok
then, watch this" naruto said! As he continued in his meditative
position he concentrated until the sewer turned into a forest of
sakura trees with a small waterfall flowing into a tranquil, clear,
pool with a few coy swimming around in it. '<B>Nice
job kit and now for my part of the deal. Every demon has its own set
of special jutsu that only it knows. I will teach you one of my most
powerful jutsu, you have to watch closely!' </B>At
that timeshe
transformed into a human form and yelled,<B>
'akurei yoshiki, Jigoku-ho uzimaki rasingan (demon style, hellfire
vortex spinning sphere) </B>and
then created two rasingan, one in each hand. In the left hand she
infused fire based charka, and in the right hand she infused wind
based charka. She then ran at one of the sakura trees and thrust her
special rasingan at the tree. Instead of destroying the tree, it
started to get bigger. The tree began to disperse and continued to
grow until it consumed the tree and completely disintegrated into a
massive flaming vortex, which sucked everything in it, annihilating
everything, and finally exploded. Naruto almost pissed himself.<B>
 'The only problem is it takes immense amounts of charka to sustain
it, but the upside is that if you use it like chidori, it will
absorbs all the charka of the enemy. This will add to its immense
power. This is the third strongest jutsu I have. This should be
more than enough to take out half of konaha, and surely more than
enough to take out a lowly konaha nuk-nin. Ok, Naruto, lets get to
training.' </B>Naruto
says nothing and just stares in disbelief. <B>'Uh,
Naruto, why are you staring at me?' </B>"I…I
just never realized you were a girl." <B>'Are
you kidding me? Just because I'm so strong you automatically label
me as a guy? That is so stereotypical!!! </B>Naruto
did a sweat-drop, "I'm so sorry! I did not mean to hurt your
feelings; it is just that… well… I was staring because you are so
pretty!" The simplicity of it hit her like a brick.For the first time
in the kuubi life, a young konaha nuk-nin made her blush. '<B>Why
don't you make about three hundred clones, half will concentrate on
making a rasingan with fire based charka, and the other half will
concentrate on making a rasingan with wind based charka. Naruto,
while your clones work on the jutsu I want to talk to you – just
you. </B> "Ok, tasu
kage-no bushin jutsu!" yelled a now blushing naruto. <B>Over
here, I need to talk with you, it concerns aku kage, he is a lackey
of the akutsu, before you ask, I know because he has purple nail
polish, and he has a tattoo of the word akutsu on his upper left arm.</B>
 They sat conversing with each other for about four hours, while
drinking a bottle of sake naruto had sealed inside of a scroll.
Naruto finally said that's enough training, and with that he pulled
all of his clones back to him. He then gained all of there collective
knowledge and said, "all right, watch and be amazed. <B>"</B>Akurei
yoshiki, kage Jigoku-ho uzimaki rasingan!" He created two
rasingan, one in each hand, then infused fire and wind based charka
into each one, he then slammed the two rasingan together, creating a
massive rasingan with a miniature flaming vortex in the center, the
only difference, the flames were black. He slammed it into the tree
and the same thing happened as when the kuubi did it, the only
difference, the flames didn't go away<B>.
What's wrong with the flames, there not going a way, naruto you
BAKA, what did you do!?!?</B>
 Never losing his calm naruto answered, "Watch, kori yoshiki,
bakuhatsu suru-no hono'o (ice style, exploding flame jutsu) all of
a sudden the black flame froze, and then exploded, sending senbon
shaped shards of charka infused ice every where. <B>Holy
crap, that was ingenuous, I would hate to be the one on the receiving
end of that jutsu.</B></p><P>Somebody
opened the door as naruto got out of his mindscape with the kuubi,
and a man stepped in who looked a lot like a shark. The shark man
finally said, "my name's kisame I'm going to bring you to the
akutsu whether you like it or not. Naruto gave him a glare that
reminds kisame of ititchi and said, "Aku kage, I am no longer in
need of your services, I'm going to kill you both."<B>
Watch out kit, that sword that kisame carries is called samhida, it
eats charka, so be careful.</B>
 "All right, I will make it quick,akurei yoshiki,
Jigoku-ho uzimaki rasingan!" he yelled. He smashed the two rasingan
together and created his ultimate trump card. He ran at kisame who
rolled out of the way, but aku wasn't that lucky, the vortex
rasingan smashed into his heart and he was completely consumed,
naruto then pointed his rasingan towards kisame, who started to run,
but he was to late and the rasingan exploded, sending black flame
everywhere it startled the villagers in konaha, because the fourths
head exploded in a cloud of black flame. It was then when naruto
yelled"kori yoshiki, bakuhatsu suru-no hono'o" the flame
promptly froze then exploded, completely destroying the monument. 
Naruto then whispered, "Kieru-no kage jutsu." He then vanished
into the night. The hokage was heading towards the doors of the
hokage tower when naruto appeared in front of him, the startled man
pulled out a kunai and threw it, because of instinct. Naruto deftly
caught it and threw it down saying, "that was one fourths of my
power, I shall destroy akutsu, then I will destroy this pathetic
little village, and with that, he vanished, but not before saying,
"naruto has gone, and Jigoku Gekido has taken his place, enjoy your
life while you still can, it will soon be at its end. <B>That
was pretty good, you scared that guy pretty bad, and by the way, kit,
I think you and I are going to get along pretty good from now on</B><I></I><I>
 But before we leave, there is something we have to do. </I><B>What
do we have to do? We have already declared war on konaha, not to
mention completely destroyed the monuments.</B><I>
 We have to take the konaha secret</I>
<I>scrolls; I was
planning to make a visit to every hidden village in the few years. I
was going to take every secret scroll from every village</I></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p>Steelman300 here. Look people I am so sorry that I have not updated
in a long time, but I lost the flash drive with my latest chapter. Not
to mention that I just learned (in the last 4 months that we are moving
to Norway. I have changed something in chapter2. I want you to vote on
how evil naruto will be, will he be:</p><p>1: Completely and utterly evil</p><p>2: Evil, but has a chance of redemption</p><p>3: Or evil to those who hurt his precious people</p><p>If
you choose three, naruto will have precious people and his attitude
will be a little like naruto's in "black flames dance in the wind, rise
of naruto" which is a very good story, and I would like to praise the
author about that.</p><p>Look, if you people have any ideas, just review and let me know, because I am in a major rut here.</p><p>Until next time, see ya, steelman300</p><p>votes are at:</p><p>1.)5</p><p>2.)3</p><p>3.)9</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p align="center">The
art of the shadow</p><P>Ch4 new
friends</p>Hay, tenatibi, I was thinking that I could go to
sauna, do you think gara would join me. I mean its not like he is
just absolutely loved in his village.<B>
 I don't know, kit, he probably will, but doesn't put all of your
eggs in a basket. I mean, he does owe you one. But what about his
siblings, ii means they wont want you just taking their brother away,
especially if he has started being more open towards everybody.</B>
Yea, you are right, I guess that they could come along. Hay, can you
give me a bloodline? I've heard stories of demons giving humans
bloodlines when thy do favors, plus, that would give me the edge when
fighting enemies, like the akuskui, which will probably be after me
sooner than later, on account of I killed one of their members. So,
please.<B> Ok, </B>but
you have to do three favors, and I can call on those favors whenever
I want to, do you agree to my terms. Yes, I agree to, your
terms, so what is the bloodline called and what does it do?<B>
 It is called chains of earth released, and it allows you to
temporarily alter the gravitational field in certain areas. I will
also give the foxes eyes, which will allow you to cast gengutsu
without making handseales, all you have to do is make eye contact
with the intended target and it concentrate on the desired affect. 
Then after you do that, all you need to do is focus your chakra into
yore eyes. It will take a while to get used to it, but once you
master it, you will be a force worthy to be reckoned with. Also,
about the other one, the strength of the field, and the size can be
altered by the use of charka, the stronger the field, where as all
you have to do to enlarge the field is to simply concentrate on the
size, visualize the field where it is supposed to be, and concentrate
the chakra into your eyes. </B><B>Thanks so much kyuube</B><B>!
 Will you please stop calling me by my title, it gets annoying after
the first couple of thousand years. Call me by my name, its
tentaibi</B> Tenatibe, why are you helping me, I
thought you hated me<B>. I used to,
but seeing the way you are treated, I couldn't bring myself to. You
have lived a horrible life, and it's my entire fault! You deserve
to be treated better, and…I have grown attached to you over the
years. It is amazing that you have gone through what you have and
still come out sane, or mostly and still smile. Because of that, I
will stick with you forever. Even if I were released, I would stay
with you.</B> Its ok Tenatibe, I don't blame you for what
happened. You have been done a great injustice, we both have. I'm
just glade that we both have each other you deserve another chance,
and if I have the chance, I will give you that chance.
<B>To say that kyuubi would
be like saying sauske loved itiche I mean here was this person whose
whole life she had ruined, say that she deserved a second chance, her
respect fore him gust kept growing, he never ceased to amaze her. </B>

<P><I><U><B>Mindscape</B></U></I></p><P><B>Come
here kit., I am about to bestow the keki genki onto you, as well as a
few other surprises, namely making you half demon </B>Naruto
walked over to where she was sitting by the waterfall He noticed her
sad a tear rolling down her cheek. <B>I'm
sorry kit.</B><I> For what… was</I>
all he could manage before he started screaming as Tenatibe started
pumping her charka into him. His charka pathways started to
dissolve, and were replaced with demon charka as tenatibis charka
started to mix with his human charka, creating a purplish charka. 
Then his muscles and bones started dissolving, being replaced with
newer, stronger ones. His heart exploded, growing back, but twice as
strong, the same fate awaited all of his other organs. After the
ritual was finished, naruto finally passed out. His eyes then boiled
out and then they grew back, but instead of his normal sky blue eyes,
this whole eye was read, except for the pupil, which looked like a
black chain that ran the length of his eye.</p><P>Real
world</p><P>When
naruto awoke, his senses were overloaded, apparently they had been
supercharged. He then felt something soft brush past his legs. He
looked down and gasped, he had four tails sprouting out of his hind
end. They were red with black tips, he also felt his ears, which
were just like fox ears. They were on top of his head and, just like
his tails; they were red with black tips. He also had claws, and,
instead of his whiskers birthmarks, he had real whiskers. Hold on
kyuube, I have an idea before tenatibi could say anything, he
screamed kage bushin no jutsu, and instead of his chakra, he pumped
the kyubis chakra into it. When the smoke cleared, there stood a
girl, about 14-15 years old, wearing a red shirt and cargo pants, she
had fox ears, whiskers, claws, and 4 tails .<B> 
Holy crap naruto, you are a genius. That was amazing , I would have
never thought that that would work, but how did you know that that
would work.</B><I> To tell you the truth,
actually didn't think that it would work. So, if you are ready,
lets head to sauna, lets of.</I></p><P>About
halfway to sauna, Naruto felt a presence behind them. He
concentrated and then realized that he recognized the chakra signal. 
Quickly he used his foxes eye to condense the chakra around his face
in the shape of a mask, the mask had the picture of a fox on it. He
then stopped and waited calmly.</p><P>About
five minuets later, he saw three figures appear and immediately
surround him. "what are you doing here, and who are you. <I>Come
on temari, I cant believe that you don't recognize the only person
to beat your brother . </I>"Naruto, is that
really you?" asked temari. <I>you better
believe it. I was heading to sauna to ask you something, but I guess
that since you are already here, I can save myself a lot of trouble.</I>
 "what did you want to ask us Naruto?" asked Gaara with an
indeferant look.<I> Well as of now, I am a rouge
ninja, probably a-class at least, but I wanted you to come with me. I</I>
<I>an going to be starting my own village
eventually, not to menton that a group of rouge nin called akutsuki
are going to be trying to kill you an take your bijju. Their group
contains members such as sassori of the red sand, along with ititchi
and the late kisame…</I> what do you mean late,
<I>well late as in I just killed him. I rammed a
black flame rasingan through his chest them made it explode,
basically destroying the hokage monument in the process, so I am
pretty sure that he is dead, although there is a slim change that he
could of used a blood bushin and then sushined away, bet the
probability of that happening is like eight million to one. so how
about it, will you join me. I mean it not like you are absolutely
loved in sauna, speaking of that, how many assignation attempts have
you survived sine the dchunine exams.</I> "only
about two hundred-fifty so far." State the demons red head coolly.
" I think that I will join you, I mean its not like i am going to
be missed. Temari, konkuro, do you want to come along. I really
don't care either way though."</p><P>"No
thank you, gara, I don't want to become a missing Nin." "neither
do I ." stated conkuro. "Fine, say that I was killed by some
rouge s-classes Nin that used water jutsu, they will probably not
believe you so Naruto could you create a blood clone for me.<I>"
 Gladly blood bushin no jutsu.</I> A copy of
gara stood there looking at everybody then Naruto simply looked at it
and it started screaming like craze it then took out a kuni and slit
its own heart. Everybody looked at Naruto quizzically and Naruto
said<I> I put him under a gengutsu that he was
slowly being eaten alive by fire ants.</I> 
Everybody shivered at how Naruto was able to make up suck a
horrendous gengutsu without handsalaes.</p><P>Just
like he was reading their minds the young blond stated<I>
the fox gave me my own bloodline that allowed me to cast gengutsus
without hand seals.</I> Naruto decided that he
wouldn't tell them everything about him just incase they went and
ratted about him to anybody, he didn't want them to have an idea
about just how powerful he had become. <I>Ok, I
hope I will see you guys later, by </I>then he
and gara left <I>so gara, was thinking we would
head to lightning country. There is supposed to be another r
jinruken there that holdes the nibi. That would be very useful for us
to have. So, I didn't tell your sibling s the true extent of my
powers, as of now, is should be able to take out a sannine at full
strength with the kyuubis help, but without their help, I could
probably take out at least dedria of atkusuki going at full strength.
 I didn't tell them the full extent of me bloodline, it also gives
me the ability to control the gravitational field of objects for as
long as I have chakra to sustain it… speaking of that, I will place
that power on me body so that my weight is dramatic increased, kind
of like training weights, except that much more affective. Would you
like one to?</I>gara
nodded his head in a yes so Naruto stopped and told him to take off
his shirt and pull up his pants leg. When gara had done that, Naruto
began to draw intricate seales on his chest, arms and legs. And when
he was done , he applied chakra to the seals and gara grunted front
the extra weight. Naruto did the same for himself.<I>
 Whenever you feel that you can move as freely with these weights as
you could regular, you can turn up the gravity. Right now it is at 3
times the gravity of the earth.</I></p><P><I><B>Time
skip 4 days later</B></I></p><P>Naruto
was training in a clearing with lots of grass. To anybody watching
it would seem as if the grass would all of a sudden flatten, then ,
couple of seconds later, it would straiten up. What was really
happening was that Naruto was using his dojutsu to flatten the grass
without crushing it. He then turned to a large rock, he then took a
small pebble and threw it op in the air, right above the large
boulder, he then narrowed his eyes and focused on the pebble becoming
fifty times heaver than normal. He applied chakra to be eyes and the
pebble shot towards the bolder, and when the pebble crashed against
the rock, the bolder was completely destroyed by the pebble. He then
sensed an incoming person and hid. As soon as he realized who the
person was, he jumped down.<I> Hay, Gaara, what
did you get for dinner, you didn't crush it with your sand agene,
did you, last time you did that, you ruined a perfectly good deer
with all that sand.</I> "no, not this time,
this time I got him with a kuni to the head." said gaara as he
dropped a couple of dead rabbets onto the ground. <I>Gaara
do you sense that? One very strong chakra source heading this way,
being perused by two even stronger sources. Come on lets hide and
will set some traps.</I> The blond then created
two blood bushins and set some quick but strong traps, including a
huge net. And then cast a gengutsu around the whole area. The
gingutsu made it look like there was g huge gorge and the only way
across was a rickety bridge. As they're his, they say the first
person come into view. Naruto immediately recognized him as sassori
of the red sand. He looked disdainfully at the bridge and seshined
across it . it was then that his peruses came into view. One of them
was ititchi, and the other was hidan. They started to walk across
the bridge when Naruto had a plan. <I>Gaara,
when I kill ititchi, I want you to kill hydan with your sand coffin,
ok.</I> "fine ." was all the redhead said. 
Naruto then put a gengutsu around hidden and landed in front of
itichi. Ititchi had , by this time just saw through the gengutsu
when he says Naruto as he dispelled it. "screw it, tsyukiomi!he
shouted, sending Naruto into the gingutsu of all gengutsus. So,
Naruto-kun, I will torture you for seven days straight. As he said
this , he stabbed Naruto whit a wakizishi, then two of him stabbed
Naruto, then six. Going all the way up to 50, ititchi said "you
now have 6 days, twenty three hours, and fifty nine minuets. 
<I>Kyuubi,is there anything you can do about this</I>
Naruto asked thought the pain.<B> No, but there
is something you can do. Look at him in the eyes an concentrate on
him and you switching places, then apply chakra to your eyes, but be
sure you have complete concentration, otherwise it wont work. </B>Naruto
then concentrated on him and iticthc said as he applied chakra to his
eyes<I> suck this ititchi. </I>He
and ititchi then switched places. Ititchi thought what the hell. 
Naruto then finished off the seven days, but he was the torturer
instead of being tortured. When he was done, ititchi collapsed and
Naruto then slit his throat. Gaara, true to his word, killed hidden
after he saw ititchi hit the floor. After that , he went over to 
the trap that sassori had sprung, which was a net that was made out
of chakra absorbent material and was uncutable, and released sassori.
 Sassori then knelt at Naruto feet and said "I am very grateful for
you killing ititchi and hidan for me.<I> why were
they trying to kill you?</I> "because quit
akutsuki. Now , is there anything I can do for you for saving my
life?"<I> actually, there is something you can
do far me. I want you to teach me in the art of puppetry.</I>
 "well then, what are we waiting fore."<I> 
Hold on, one second. Gaara, I have something fore you. </I>Naruto
then took out a syringes out of his bag and then stuck it in ititchis
eye, he then sucked out some blood and went over to Gaara, the then
told him to lean his head back an [prepare himself. Garra did as
asked, and then plunged the needle into gaaras eyes and<I>
said</I> <I>you now have the
sharangan dojutsu, o, and saddori, I want ititchi to be my first
puppet.</I></p><P><I><B>Timeskip 4 yeares</B></I></p><P>Naruto
and gaara had just arrived in lightning country. Sassori had long
since left the group, as naruto ha quickly surpassed hin in his
puppetering skills. As a parting gift, he gave him about ten of his
best puppets, and some scrolls describing how to seal weapons in his
body. Naruto had become so adept at puppetry, that he controls his
puppets with one finger. As they walked through the streets anybody
looking would see an s-class missing Nin walking behind somebody with
five tales and somebody with a large gourd. If somebody were to look
close enough, they would see the blond's finger twitching in
accordance with his puppets.. as he walked through the streets ,
somebody stopped them in the middle of the street, calling the two
ginrukins out. "are you the jegikido gekkido and gaara of the
group, the band of demons?" <I>gaara, its my
turn to handle the bounty hunter, right?</I> The
red head nodded a yes.<I> In that case yes I am. 
</I>"I am chigo tsuchi, s-class bounty hunter
and…argh" ht bounty hunter said as a three puppets squered him
with katanas. Naruto had had the puppets in the crows, disguised as
civilians. Naruto had never stopped walking and just stepped over
the body as gaara joined him. "You know, you could have just
crushed him with the chains of earth released. <I>Yea,
I know, but I wanted to make an example of him to diterr any other
cocky bounty hunters who wanted to confront me. </I>Said
naruto as he walked onto a training field. He saw a girl about his
age crying as she was being pelted with stones and kuni. Naruto was
instantly pissed and raised the gravity of the attackers about 5
times. As they all fell he walked over to them he asked them why
they were beating her and kid spat that she was different, she had a
demon locked insider, so therefore , she was a demon. Naruto then
looked at them all and they started screaming in pain he then waited
ten minuets and then had ititchi kill them with amaratsu. He then
walked over to the girl and asked<I> what is
youre name? </I> Y…Yu…yugito." She
stuttered through the tears. <I>Well, yugito, I
have come to ask you if you would like to join my friend in the red
over there. we have demons inside us, so we know what it feels like
to be picked on. </I>"ok, I would love to get
away from this place." <I>Perfect. We leave
tomorrow, so get your belongings, as meet us at this training ground
tomorrow at noon, ok.</I> "ok" said youito
with a huge grin.</p><P><I>Come
on, I have some business with the rikage.</I> "
 you are going to kill him aren't you." Said the emotionless
jinrukin.<I> Probably, I just might have to. he
would make a good addition to my collection of puppet kages. </I>Gaara
nodded in agreement although he thought that he really didn't need
another one, after all he already had the first and fourth hokage.</p>
