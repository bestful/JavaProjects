I hope you like my one-shot that I made This is another story that has Kyuubi in it and sorry, Kyuubi is a guy in this one to. I always make Kyuubi a guy. This is yaoi and your going to have to guess who our little Naruto-chan is going to be paired up with. This took forever to finish! Sorry if the chapters are pretty short.</p><p>"talking"</p><p>'thinking'</p><p>The main character is Naruto and this is a high school fic but they're demons and humans in the school. Naruto is a hanyou kitsune but has a fluffy fox tail with kawaii kitsune ears along with it. Naruto is 15</p><p>--------------------------------------------</p><p>It was a peaceful morning and for our young kitsune hanyou it was his first day in high school. His alarm clock beeped and beeped until Naruto crushed it and slowly went back to sleep.</p><p>It wasn't until a half an hour later that he woke up to find his alarm clock crushed. He got up with a yawn and sat there thinking for a minute and realized he was going to be late for his first day of high school. His eyes widened in horror wondering what the teachers would do to him since practically all of them are demons. He jumped out of bed and rushed to get dress.</p><p>"I'm going to be late! It's also my first day to!" struggling to put his pants on and fell on his ass for rushing.</p><p>After dressing and wrestling to put his shirt on he went to grab his pack and tripped over the coffee table and landed on his face.</p><p>'Great. First I land on my ass, I wrestle with my shirt, and now I've landed on my face.' Naruto thought quickly bouncing back, grabbing his pack, and running as fast as he could out the door.</p><p>He was only three minutes late so far. He ran down the hall not paying attention to where he was going and ended up colliding into someone and landed on his ass yet again with an "oof" along with the other person.</p><p>"Watch where your going moron!" the person yelled irritably.</p><p>Naruto's ears twitched in annoyance at the rude man. "Well sorry bastard but if you don't mind I'm late an-" Naruto stopped talking as he looked up into the saddest eyes he's ever seen.</p><p>The man of course was taller than himself, blood red eyes, moon light pale skin, wide dark whisker marks, full light pink lips, long kitsune ears with black on the inside(A/N: You know what Kyuubi's demon ears look like), nine long crimson tails, wild spiky crimson hair, black nails, black choker necklace, black long sleeve shirt with the words suicide on it in red, black baggy jeans that goths wear with all those chains, and black sneakers with red laces.</p><p>In other words he was HOT! Well to Naruto he was hot but the stranger still looked dangerous and deadly. Naruto just kept staring at the teen in front of him curiously but found he was starring, blushed, and looked away.</p><p>"S-sorry I wasn't paying attention and I'm late so if you don't mind I'm going to leave." Naruto said not looking at the teen and brushing off the invisible dust particles from his clothes. He smiled, "Oh, and my name is Uzumaki Naruto."</p><p>The teen gave him a dangerous smile that promised pain in the near future and narrowed his eyes, "Well Uzumaki congratulations, you have just made your first enemy and I'll be seeing you later."</p><p>The mysterious teen walked away leaving Naruto standing there mouth hung wide open. But Naruto realized he still needed to get to class and ran as fast he could to the room. As always tho, Naruto was late. When he reached the classroom he looked to the teachers desk and gave a sigh of relief to see the teacher not here yet and found his best friend with an extra seat beside him.</p><p>"Hey Gaara." Naruto said greeting his friend with a smile like always and Gaara gave his same old high to which had the red head nodding in acknowledgment.</p><p>Gaara was a Tanuki demon with tanuki like ears and a strange looking tail. He wore a red T-shirt, black jeans, and red sneakers.</p><p>Gaara and Naruto had been friends since they were in sixth grade. Naruto liked being around Gaara and Gaara the same. They went everywhere with each other they even live with each other which made Naruto start thinking.</p><p>"Gaara... WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME UP!" Naruto shouted eye twitching in anger.</p><p>"I didn't feel like it." Gaara said showing no emotion.</p><p>"WELL THANKS TO YOU I NOW HAVE AN ENEMY BECAUSE i ACCIDENTALLY RAN INTO HIM!" Naruto heaved and huffed out his breath in anger but calmed down and found the entire class staring at him.</p><p>"Great Naruto, who'd you get mad this time you baka." Sakura, the cotton candy haired girl with a huge forehead said.</p><p>"Yeah baka who was it." Sakura's friend/rival said, her name was Ino and she was just as annoying.</p><p>"For your information I don't know who the hell he is and I just ran into the guy." Naruto gave the two girls a bored look his ears drooping down.</p><p>"Well can you at least tell us what kind of demon he is. My brother does know everyone in the school and I will probably know who it is dobe." a raven, Sasuke, said giving Naruto a smirk that said you-know-I'm-better-than-you smirk.</p><p>Naruto gave a pout but said with a glare, "He's a nine tailed kitsune demon with red hair and blood red eyes."</p><p>Sasuke's eyes widen with shock but quickly went back to his stuck up look and said," Well your lucky to even be alive, that's Kyuubi. He's one of the strongest guys in the whole school. He's in a gang called Bijuu and they don't get along with anyone but themselves and kill people who get in their way or just for fun."</p><p>Naruto widen his eyes in realization that he could have been killed and he was to stupid to sense the evil demonic aurora coming from him. Naruto slumped in his desk wishing he was at home in his comfy orange bed.</p><p>Gaara looked at his friend worried for his safety. Naruto saw the worried look in his friends eye's and gave him a reassuring smile. Naruto was just about to start a conversation with his quiet friend but then the teacher just came in.</p><p>Naruto looked at his teacher and kinda was freaked out. The man before him had mismatched eyes and the left one had a scar over it, grey hair that stood out towards the left, a mask, white button up shirt, blue jeans, a wolf like tail, and elf shaped ears.</p><p>"Hello class, my name is Kakashi and I'm going to be your history teacher." Kakashi said his eyes turning upward in a smile.</p><p>Kakashi made his way towards his desk and started taking attendance. Once that was over he sat down and took out a little orange book that you usually see weird men carrying. Everyone just stared at their weird teacher and said weird teacher looked up and smiled at them through his mask.</p><p>"Oh, first day we don't do anything because I don't feel like it so talk amongst yourselves." then he went back to reading his dirty book giggling like a perverted old man here and there.</p><p>'This is going to be a weird year. Hopefully my other teachers wont be as crazy as this one.' Naruto thought but then decided to chat with his friend for the rest of the class time.</p><p>-------------------------------------------------</p><p>Next class is gym and trust me. This class is going to be chaotic. Guess who the teacher is guess I dare you to! But for gym they mix up the grades k. Please review they make me update faster I also promise to make the chapters as long as possible.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>The next chapter
to my story. I hope you like this one and I need some pairing ideas.
Ask for a pairing and you might see it but it can't be Gaara cause I
have an idea for him already. I thank everyone who has reviewed, you
have encouraged me to continue.</p><P>"talking"</p><P>'thinking'</p><P>-------------------------------------</p><P><I>red eyed

interrupted by the bell for his next class before he could finish his
poem. He gave a sigh and went to gym, he wondered what this gym class
would be like. He walked to his next class with Gaara walking with
him. When they got there they saw an old man with long spiky hair
standing there waiting for everyone to sit in the bleachers.</p><P>Once everyone
sat down and started to chat the old man cleared his throat to get
everyones attention to himself.</p><P>"Hello
class, my name is Jiraiya and I'm your gym teacher." The weird
looking man said.</p><P>"He looks
to old to be a gym teacher." Naruto whispered to Gaara and the
tanuki boy just gave him a nod as in an agreement.</p><P>"Oooohhhh!
Is that so little blond kitsune!" Jiraiya said narrowing his
eyes at Naruto, "Well just for that you all get nicknames and
you can all thank the blond right there!"</p><P>Jiraiya pointed
at Naruto and then everyone turned towards him and glared daggers at
him. Jiraiya got out the list of names to give out nicknames.</p><P>"Ok Blondie
I'll call you... Sunshine." Jiraiya said making Naruto
grumble, pout, and glare at him. "Gaara, You are Pandaman."
This made Gaara glare at him and wish death upon the old man.</p><P>This got a laugh
out of one of the students. Everyone knew it was one of the biggest
mistake to get Gaara mad but only an exceptional few got to make fun
of him. The one who was laughing at him was none other than the
powerful Shukaku.</p><P>Shukaku was
tanner than Gaara but not to tan, sandy blond hair with blue veiny
shapes in it that covered his left eye, black around his amber eyes
like Gaara's, blue tanuki ears, he is big and muscular, he had a
tanuki tail with blue veiny shapes on it, his nails blue at the end,
dull yellow t-shirt that says sand demon in blue letters, faded
ripped up blue jeans, and black and yellow sneakers.</p><P>Gaara gave
Shukaku, his older brother, a glare that could kill if looks could.
Shukaku was to preoccupied to notice his younger brothers glare and
continued laughing while his kitsune friend, Kyuubi, sat there
starring at him like he grew a second head.</p><P>"Ok...
Shukaku." said Jiraiya and then gave his famous mischievous
smirk, "If you think that names funny here yours. You are now
called Mr. Sandman."</p><P>Everyone went
silent and Shukaku immediately stopped his fit of laughs to give a
glare even scarier then Gaara's. Kyuubi smirked in amusement of the
name given to his friend but that smirk was quickly replaced with a
bone chilling glare and a frown that could scare off the bravest
warrior once he heard HIS nickname.</p><P>"Kyuubi,
you shall now be called... vixen(1)." Jiraiya said not noticing
the glare and killing intent aura from the kitsune.</p><P>Everyone sat
there scared to death to what Kyuubi would do. Shukaku even stopped
his glaring at the teacher to see what the kitsune demon would do.
But to Jiraiya's luck he was called to the office and left to let the
'children' talk.</p><P>Once the teacher
left everyone was still a little creeped out and scared because of
Kyuubi but still went on chatting. Naruto went to get a drink from
the water fountain but unfortunately he had to run into his 'enemy'
again. He looked up ready to apologize realizing who it was decided
to try and runaway, BIG mistake. Show fear to Kyuubi and he takes
advantage of it.</p><P>"Awww whats
wrong? Little mutt afraid of me." Kyuubi said taunting Naruto
into doing something foolish, but being Naruto he did.</p><P>"Shut up
bastard! Leave me alone!" Naruto shouted quickly covering his
mouth while berating himself in his head about how stupid he was.</p><P>Kyuubi stopped
surprised the half kitsune demon shouted to him. But surprise was
quickly smothered by the rage that boiled from underneath. Kyuubi
growled showing his gleaming white canines and his eyes glowed an
even darker shade of red.</p><P>Naruto squeaked
and realized he had to get away and now or who knows what could
happen. Naruto tried to get away but was grabbed by the throat of the
pissed off demon and gagged from his throat being squeezed harshly.
Naruto used his little claws to scratch at the grip on his throat but
to no avail, Kyuubi just squeezed harder.</p><P>Naruto gasped
out for breath trying so hard to get away from the iron strong grip
on his throat, fading into unconsciousness. He fainted from lack of
air just when the teacher came rushing over to his aid then
everything went black.</p><P>When Naruto
awoke again all he saw was a blinding light but everything became
clear within a few minutes. Naruto groaned when he sat up feeling a
slight pain in his neck but still not remembering what happened. But
when it all came back to him he went pale knowing he could have died
right there in the hands of, Kyuubi.</p><P>'Omg! I almost
died I almost DIED!' Naruto thought looking around noticing he was in
the nurses office but he still didn't feel very safe.</p><P>Naruto sprang
from the bed and was about to run out but was stopped by a scary
looking blond woman. She grabbed him by the back of his shirt yanking
him and throwing back onto the bed.</p><P>"Oi! You
can't leave here yet boy!" Yelled the woman her brown eyes
narrowing in anger.</p><P>Naruto was about
to shout back but decided not to seeing as what happened to him last
time he did. He looked upon the scary woman before him but the only
thing that really stood out were her huge... ummm... boobs...</p><P>"I-I'm
sorry. I guess I just panicked... Whats your name?" Naruto
asked his little kitsune ears twitching and tail wagging back and
forth to show how curious he was.</p><P>"Well I'm
Tsunade and I'm not suprised you panicked, you were after all almost
killed by Kyuubi. He even scares me at times." Tsunade said
remembering the first time he glared at her and shivered at the
memory.</p><P>"Oh, well
I'm Naruto! Uzumaki Naruto and my dream is to become hokage of the
town!" Shouted Naruto giving his famous foxy grin.</p><P>Tsunade laughed
at his action knowing who he reminded her of. She gave Naruto some
more medicine and told him his friend was waiting for him. Naruto
told Tsunade goodbye and went out to his friend. Gaara was sitting
there in one of the chairs in the office reading a magazine but put
it down when he saw his friend.</p><P>"Well ready
to go home you were out for the rest of school." Gaara said
looking at his friend noticing the bruise on Naruto's neck.</p><P>"Oh, ok
lets hurry and leave." Naruto said but noticed the worry in his
friends eyes, "I'm alright ok." Naruto gave him a
reasurring smile and started to walk out of the office.</p><P>Gaara sighed but
still followed his friend out of the office then outside of the
building. They were having a nice conversation until they spotted
something they didn't need to see right now and hoped they'd never
see again.</p><P>Naruto gasped
out the name he never wanted to say but still at the same time wanted
to, "Kyuubi."</p><P>--------------------------------------------------</p><P>Not a very good
chapter I know but I'll make the next one longer because I know some
of you actually like how this story is going. I'll update as fast as
I can until the read my other creations. This is also a school with
demons, half demons, and humans. Sasuke, Sakura, and Ino are so far
the only humans you'll ever really see interacting in my story with
demons. The others are to scared.</p><P>(1) Its supposed
to be like an insult to Kyuubi since female fox demons would be
called vixens. Kyuubi is feminine looking to put it simple.</p><P>review now or
you die!!!!!!!! Please</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p>Yay! People like my story! I thank all of you for reviewing my story so I give all of you cookies! Ok I have a question, do you guys think I need a beta? Ok that's it now on to the story! One more thing! I am now putting this on livejournal ok so if you see this story there then you will all know its mine!</p><p>"talking"</p><p>'thinking'</p><p>character change</p><p>----------------------------------</p><p>Naruto looked at the nine-tailed demon fox before him and just wanted to runaway as fast as he could, but he knew he wouldn't be able to get away. Kyuubi could smell the fear from the blond kitsune and gave a sadistic smile to show he knew of Naruto's fear of him. Kyuubi took pleasure from seeing the blond shake in fear of him, it made the demon feel... powerful and in control.</p><p>Shukaku stared on at what was happening knowing if Kyuubi wasn't stopped he would kill his brother's friend. He also knew his brother would never forgive him if he let it happen so he had to think fast before Kyuubi did something.</p><p>"Oi Kyuubi, don't you have to be home soon?" Shukaku said hopping to get Kyuubi's attention, "Didn't your father want to see you?"</p><p>Kyuubi bristled at the mention at his father but gave a grunt of agreement. He turned away quickly and disappeared within the confines of the shadows. Naruto let out the breath he didn't know he was holding in and gave a shaky smile to Gaara.</p><p>"Arigato Shukaku." Gaara said to his elder brother showing no emotion on his face but you could see the gratitude in his eyes.</p><p>"No problem, I didn't feel like seeing your little friend die anyway." Shukaku said smirking at his younger brother. "You'd probably kick my ass and never let me near yours again if I didn't help."</p><p>Shukaku quickly disappeared in a swirl of sand to dodge Gaara's cold death glare of doom that would freeze you to the spot if you looked directly into his eyes. Naruto just stood there in shock at what Shukaku just said.</p><p>"... Does this mean that..." Naruto said before giving a big foxy smile and bounding off towards their shared apartment shouting out, "Incest! Incest!!!"</p><p>Gaara did an anime fall but quickly recovered and followed his friend back to their home to teach the blond a lesson on what happens when you make fun of your friend for loving their brother.</p><p>Kyuubi came out of the shadows to stand in front of the mansion. He quickly entered to find his mother standing in the living room talking on the phone with a friend.</p><p>Kyuubi's mother was very beautiful, she has long snowy white hair that went to her waist, her skin a creamy white color, ruby red eyes that were bright and full of life unlike Kyuubi's dark blood red eyes, full lips colored with dark red lipstick, nice smooth curves to her feminine shape, ink black claws that are in fact natural like Kyuubi's, kitsune ears, nine long white fluffy tails, she wore a long red kimono that had cherry blossoms all across it.</p><p>She then noticed that her son came home and gave a quick hello and then went back to her call. Kyuubi gave a sigh to the lack of attention he received from his mother today, usually she said hello and tried to start a conservation with him but I guess today was different.</p><p>Kyuubi entered the kitchen to get a drink but quickly regretted it to find his elder brother in there fixing himself a sandwich. They glared at each other knowing a fight was going to start.</p><p>Kyuubi's brother, Eneku had shaggy black hair, light tan skin, dark violet eyes, wide dark whisker marks adorning each cheek(1), lithe form much like Kyuubi's with girlish hips to match(2), grayish claws, kitsune ears with three piercings in the right ear and one in the left ear, nine long black tails, a navy t-shirt, tan cargo pants, and blue sneakers on.</p><p>"You look like shit brat." Eneku said sneering at his shorter brother.</p><p>"Nothing you should know of slut." Kyuubi shot back with just as much force while getting a Dr Pepper(A/N:Dr Pepper rules all!!!!).</p><p>They glared at each other a few minutes more before Eneku figured Kyuubi had enough of him for the day and walked out of the kitchen only to have his younger sister but still older sister to Kyuubi enter. She walked in with all her glory only just to give her younger brother a glare that could send you to hell and back.</p><p>Her name was Yuki, she had black and white hair that went to the middle of her back, cold blue eyes, an even skin tone, thin lips covered in that glittery pink lipgloss(A/N: ewww I hate that stuff), kitsune ears with black tips, black and white tails, white tank top with devilish angel in red glitter on it, tight blue jeans, and white sneakers.</p><p>They glared at each other but instead of starting a fight with his sister he left the kitchen and headed towards his bedroom. He didn't have to talk with that man(3) until after dinner so he went to his room for some alone time with his computer. He went up the many stairs and went down many corridors to finally reach the black door to his room and went in to only lock the door so he wouldn't be disturbed.</p><p>In his room the walls are all black with a painting on the right wall of a bleeding demon like angel crying tears of crimson with the words monster all over the wall in red, his big black bed sat in the middle of his room against the back wall with black silky sheets and red pillows on the bed, his red dresser against the right wall, his computer beside his dresser, a TV on the other side of the dresser, on the opposite side from his bed was a desk with many drawings scattered across the surface of it, his carpet was a deep red color, and a door that led to his own bathroom.</p><p>Kyuubi took off his shoes and left the beside the door and took a seat at the computer desk. He opened up the internet and went to his favorite site, this was a site that let you write your own stories but it couldn't have real live people in it so Kyuubi disguised himself and everyone else with different descriptions and different names, basically, the story was about his own life.</p><p>He opened his account and started to type and type and type. It was hours until he finally stopped his typing, he skipped dinner, and noticed he should go to that man now. He put up the new chapter and turned off the computer once it was done and left to go to that man.</p><p>Kyuubi walked down the dark hallway to the room that he didn't want to enter. He opened the door as quietly as he could and quickly went in and closed the door behind him. He went a little closer to the man in front of him but not to close. The man looked upon the small kitsune in front of him and gave a bone chilling smile at Kyuubi.</p><p>The mans name is Ketsueki, he has long black hair in a low ponytail, dark blue eyes that were currently narrowed at Kyuubi, wide dark whisker marks, tan skin, kitsune ears, nine long black tails, black t-shirt, and black jeans.</p><p>"Wha-what do you want?" Kyuubi asked not making eye contact with Ketsueki.</p><p>"All I wanted to know is how my son was doing in school, are you doing ok?" Ketsueki said with fake concern in his voice.</p><p>"I'm doing ok... is there anything else I can do for you." Kyuubi asked while berating himself in his mind, 'That sick bastard! Look what he has done to me! I've become a little kit again from just being in the same room as him. I'm sick with myself.'</p><p>"Aww, I think your scared of me, aren't you boy." Ketsueki taunting Kyuubi into becoming defensive.</p><p>"Shut up bastard! Stop toying with me!" Kyuubi shouted, mad at what this man is making him into.</p><p>Ketsueki snarled at Kyuubi's outburst and in a flash was behind Kyuubi holding Kyuubi's arm so he couldn't get away. Kyuubi knew his action was going to be punished and was scared to what he was going to do.</p><p>Ketsueki used his dark violet chakra to rip and tare at Kyuubi's clothing leaving him naked and exposed. He threw Kyuubi on the floor and pounced on the boy in front of him and bit at the tender flesh of Kyuubi's neck. The dark red blood poured from the wound dying a spot in the floor red. Even tho the wound would heal it still hurt Kyuubi a lot at this.</p><p>But the thing that Kyuubi was fearing was coming true, he was going to be raped again, it happened when he was eight and it continued to happen. It happened so many times Kyuubi lost count of it all.</p><p>Ketsueki ripped at the tender flesh of Kyuubi's body leaving horrible wounds but didn't worry of anyone finding out for nine-tailed foxes were known for their amazing healing abilities. Ketsueki continued to torture Kyuubi but decided to go ahead with the rest and proceeded to remove his own clothing.</p><p>Kyuubi heard the rustling of clothing and started to thrash around not wanting this and tried as hard as he could to get away. But it was no use, Ketsueki held the squirming kitsune demon in place and moved Kyuubi's tails away from what he wanted. Ketsueki wanted Kyuubi to suffer so he skipped the stretching and lube and just drove his hard-on into Kyuubi's small entrance.</p><p>Kyuubi screamed from the intrusion feeling the blood run down his thighs and Ketsueki's rapid thrusts. Kyuubi screamed for help any kind of help, but know one could hear him. Maybe only his brother and sister but they didn't care, they hated Kyuubi as much as Ketsueki does.</p><p>For Kyuubi, it felt like it was never going to end. But it finally came to a quick end when he felt Ketsueki seed explode deep within him. His father pulled out with some more blood and some cum leak out after.</p><p>He teleported Kyuubi into his room to leave Kyuubi on the floor in his room. It was only after a half an hour that he got up to take a shower. In the shower he scrubbed himself raw to get the filth off him and to try and wash all the shame away too. When Kyuubi got out soaking wet he looked himself in the mirror.</p><p>He frowned at what he saw, he looked so perfect when he didn't feel like it. The only thing that stood out were the cuts on his arms and wrists. These ones wouldn't heal, only if he truly wanted them gone but they wouldn't go on their own. he got out the knife to add some more cuts to his collection.</p><p>As the blood ran down his arms he walked into his room to lie on his bed. You'd think someone would cry after all this, but Kyuubi couldn't. He could never cry, even when he wanted to. He learned it was only weakness, he also got punished by Ketsueki if he cried.\</p><p>He would have told his mother but... Ketsueki threatened he'd kill her if he told anyone. So Kyuubi dealt with all the beatings and the rapes, just as long as he still gets to see her smile. Its all worth it... just for that.</p><p>Kyuubi fell asleep, not knowing that someone saw him when he was teleported back to his room. Not knowing how hurt she was to know this happened. Not knowing she was crying for him, crying... and saying sorry.</p><p>---------------------------------------------------</p><p>Yesh! So much angst! Yes I know, I'm sick and twisted but this is how it goes ok and don't worry Kyuubi will have a happy life... sooner or later...</p><p>(1)Only male kitsunes have whisker marks</p><p>(2) There aren't that many female nine-tailed foxes anymore, its rare to find them, so now male nine-tailed foxes can produce babies. That's why they need female looking hips.</p><p>(3)Kyuubi can't think of Ketsueki as his father for what hes done to him so he'll call his father by his name or that man or this man.</p><p>Review now or Kyuubi will kill you and Naruto will cry!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>Hiya peeps! I
now have chappy 4 and I'm sorry for what I had happen to poor little
Kyuubi. I love him to bits but hes gotta have a hard life in this
story... I think in all of my stories he has a hard life...</p><P>"talking"</p><P>'thinking'</p><P>(author notes)</p><P>------------------------------------</p><P>It was morning
when Naruto awoke from his slumber to find Gaara just about to walk
into his room.</p><P>"What are
you doing?" Naruto yawned out and stretched his arms and legs.</p><P>"I was
coming to wake you up so we could walk to school together."
Gaara said in his monotone voice, still standing in the doorway.</p><P>"I thought
you'd leave me again!" Naruto accused the tanuki, pointing his
index finger at Gaara.</p><P>"Shukaku
told me it would be dangerous if I didn't walk with you since you
don't know any transportation jutsu's and Kyuubi would kill you if he
saw you again." Gaara said showing some worry in his cold aqua
green eyes.</p><P>Naruto smiled at
his friend showing his appreciation for this. He then proceeded to
get dress in his orange hoodie with a red spiral on the front and his
faded blue jeans. They left the house and quickly went to school,
avoiding Kyuubi the whole time.</p><P>First period was
very boring but it gave Naruto time to think about what has happened
to him so far.</p><P>'So far its been
horrible, I've made a deadly enemy, I have a lazy ass teacher, I have
now been named sunshine by my gym teacher that creeps me out, I was
ALMOST killed, I was almost killed again by Gaara for making fun of
him being together with his brother, I practically had a heart attack
because Shukaku decided to scare the shit out of me, I was mortified
when Shukaku and Gaara started to make-out in front of me, I fell on
my ass thirty times yesterday, I burned my tongue on my precious
ramen, AND my blankets choked me to death but luckily Gaara saved me
from the fiends!' Naruto thought all this sighing in frustration.</p><P>Naruto looked
around the room at all the people here finally seeing all his first
period class mates. There was Sasuke-teme, Sakura, Ino,
Hinata-chan(she's still human), Rock Lee(he is human), Gaara(You all
knew that), Kiba(dog demon), Shikamaru(deer demon), Neji(human), and
Kankuro(tanuki demon). Naruto liked almost all the people here except
Sasuke-teme, Sakura, Ino, and Neji.</p><P>Naruto looked at
the clock with a pleading look hoping that this period was almost
over... wait! 'I don't want this period over yet! I never want it to
be over!! I don't want to see... Kyuubi again! God, last time I saw
him I almost peed my pants!' Naruto thought panicking.</p><P>Gaara saw the
scared look on his friends face and asked whats wrong and Naruto told
him exactly what was on his mind.</p><P>"Don't
worry, Shukaku is going to be trying to distract Kyuubi and the
teacher is also on alert so your safe." Gaara whispered to
Naruto trying to ease his friends fear away with this information.</p><P>Naruto gave a
sigh of relief(Naruto sure is sighing alot) but some of the fear
crept back when the bell rang. Naruto got up and went to his next
class... gym. The teacher was still using their dumb nicknames and he
got a lot of glares from the students. Naruto still didn't like his
nickname, sure he had sunny blond hair but still... sunshine...
whats with that!</p><P>The teacher came
in and got everyone to do their stretches and run a few laps around
the gym. It was then that he decided to pair us up for weight
lifting. Unfortunately for sunshine, Naruto, the teacher decided him
and vixen, Kyuubi, needed to get along more so he paired the two up.</p><P>"b-bu-but I
don't wanna be paired up with him!" Naruto shouted at Jiraiya,
"He's scary and sadistic!</p><P>Naruto quickly
covered his mouth wishing he didn't have such a big mouth and that he
could keep it shut. He looked towards Kyuubi seeing the kitsune demon
smirking evilly at him. Jiraiya made the two go over there to the
weights but still kept a watchful eye on them.</p><P>"Hehehe...
Your not still mad about yesterday are you?" Naruto asked
nervously putting his hand on the back of his neck which Kyuubi
recognized as a sign of nervousness or embarrassment.</p><P>Kyuubi kept
quiet and sat in the corner away from the kitsune hanyou. Naruto knew
he wouldn't get an answer from Kyuubi and went to lift some small
weights. Naruto being curious and noticing a scar on Kyuubi's arm
immediately asked what it was, Naruto crept closer to Kyuubi.</p><P>Kyuubi went into
defense mode and said in a harsh snappy voice, "Nothin now go
back to your weight lifting before I decided to crush every bone in
your body.</p><P>Naruto getting
the message went back to weight lifting, but still glancing at the
scar every once and awhile. Class didn't seem to last long because
the bell rang but Naruto didn't know what his next class was. He
looked at his assign classes to see he had history class next and to
his pleasure his teacher was Iruka.</p><P>He got his book
and other supplies for the class and headed off. He reached the class
and instantly greeted his favorite teacher.</p><P>"Hi
Iruka-sensei!" Naruto greeted cheerfully.</p><P>"Hello
Naruto, I noticed you weren't here yesterday and I was worried is
everything ok?" Iruka asked going into mother hen mode.</p><P>"I'm fine
ok." Naruto said trying to get Iruka out of mother hen mode.</p><P>Naruto walked
over to the desk by Gaara and sat down then started to chat with
him... which wasn't easy. Iruka took attendance and talked about...
history stuff. He then told everyone to get with their partner to
talk about their project.</p><P>"What
project and I don't have a partner?" Naruto asked feeling left
out.</p><P>"Oh, your
project is to learn more about your partners family history."
Iruka said in his cheerful teacher voice, "Naruto, your partner
is Kyuubi."</p><P>... Silence was
all that was heard for a good few minutes. Naruto's world just seemed
to fall apart on him when he heard who his partner was. Naruto almost
fainted when he saw the smirk on Kyuubi's face.</p><P>'This can't be
happening, this can't be happening, this can't be HAPPENING!!!!!!'
Naruto thought starting to sweat in fear.</p><P>"Oh, and
you guys have to live with each other at your houses to." Iruka
added in smiling not knowing what Naruto was going through.</p><P>The rest of the
day went by peacefully and when Naruto was just about to go through
the doors to go home when a hand grabbed his shoulders. He froze for
a minute and looked at his shoulders to see black claws, he then
looked behind him to see Kyuubi.</p><P>"Oi
blondie, I guess I'm staying at your place ok. Now give me your
address." Kyuubi commanded with a stern look on his handsome
face.</p><P>Naruto nodded
his head and gave Kyuubi his address. When Kyuubi was out of sight he
bolted for his house. When he reached the house he opened the door
and slammed it shut. He leaned against it for support, panting,
trying to get air into his lungs.</p><P>'What am I going
to do' Naruto thought sliding down the door onto his butt, his ears
drooping in thought and worry.</p><P>-----------------------------------------------------</p><P>Sorry it took so
long but at least I don't update every year like some authors... you

a little OC in this...</p><P>"talking"</p><P>'thinking'</p><P>(author notes)</p><P>--------------------------------------------</p><P>The first thing
Kyuubi did when he got home was that he ran up stairs and immediately
started to pack to go to that little blonde's house. He was done
pretty quickly but before he left, he got his precious laptop so he
could continue his story.</p><P>He headed down
the stairs but, he was stopped by his mother. He told her he had to
go stay the night at someone's house for a project and immediately
left, giving her no time to talk. About to walk out the door but was
stopped by his annoying sister.</p><P>"Yuki, what
do you want." Kyuubi said aggravated by being kept here when he
wanted to leave, "I'm in a hurry, now hurry up."</p><P>"Geez, you
sound happy." Yuki said sarcastically, batting her long
eyelashes, "Well, moms been pretty upset since last night...
you didn't do anything again this time did you?"</p><P>Kyuubi paused
for a moment thinking of all that happened last night. he couldn't
recall of anything he did to her. he was pretty much lost when he
came to other's feelings.</p><P>Kyuubi ignored
his sister and left to get going to the annoying halflings house. On
his way he did notice his brother bringing home his boyfriend, which
was the sixth one this week.</p><P>(Now we are
going to see what Naruto is doing)</p><P>"I will not
let that... that... monster in this house or near you again!"
Gaara shouted at the poor blond kitsune, who flattened his ears to
his head from the volume of the red heads voice.</p><P>"Gaara, its
for the project, and I'll be fine so don't worry." Naruto said
smiling at his tanuki friend, getting up, gabbing Gaara's bag, and
taking him to the door, "Now, just go to Shukaku's house for
your project and have fun ok... don't do anything that you'll
regret."</p><P>Naruto closed
the door and gave a sigh of relief at having Gaara gone, so the
protective tanuki wouldn't breathe down his neck at having the nine
tailed kitsune here. Naruto decided to fix himself some ramen while
he waited for Kyuubi to arrive, for some reason he felt excited at
having the other kitsune demon here with him.</p><P>'That's
weird... I'm actually excited to have the guy that almost killed
me here... maybe I should of had Gaara and Shukaku stay here with
me.' Naruto thought, frowning grimly at the thought of being sliced
open and having his name written on the wall by the insane demon.</p><P>Naruto watched
TV for about an hour before he heard a knock on the door. He got up
answering it, forgetting that Kyuubi was coming, and almost fainting
when seeing the kitsune in front of him but remembered the reason
Kyuubi was there after a couple of seconds.</p><P>"Come on in
Kyuubi." Naruto moved so Kyuubi could get through, "Just
set down your stuff over there by the couch and make yourself at
home."</p><P>Kyuubi put his
stuff down were Naruto told him to but then got out his laptop and
started on his story. Naruto, being the curious little kitsune he
was, went beside Kyuubi and tried to read over his shoulder. Kyuubi
sensing, and feeling the body warmth, shut his laptop down and looked
at Naruto waiting for an explanation.</p><P>"Oh,
hahahaha... well... just wanting to know what your doing... and
trying to get to know you better..." Naruto looked into
Kyuubi's intense red eyes trying to see what Kyuubi was feeling, but
lost his confidence and looked away, "Sooooo... you like to
write... what kinda story are you writing?"</p><P>Kyuubi looked at
Naruto, not knowing what to say but just decided to "Hn"
for his answer. Naruto, taking the hint, went to his bedroom and left
Kyuubi to type his story.</p><P>Naruto paced
back and forth trying to figure out what to do. He argued with
himself for about an hour.</p><P>"Ok, if he
wants to play like that fine! I'll just have to crack him open, it
shouldn't be that hard, I have gotten through Gaara after all."
Naruto nodded to himself in agreement and decided he would become
Kyuubi's friend no matter what.</p><P>-----------------------------------------</p><P>I hope you all
like this... Now your all going to have to wait to see what Naruto
does to Kyuubi. I feel evil... please review!</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>Here's chappie
six! I'm trying to make them longer and get them done faster k. I
don't have much to say buuut... there will be a lemon sooner or
later... Well… later... depends how fast Naruto can get through to
Kyuubi... I'm sorry it took so long cause wouldn't let me
update... I guess thats happened to others... The next chappie may
not be put up for awhile again cause I atleast wanna add one new
chappie to each of my other stories. Now you may enjoy!</p><P>"Talking"</p><P>'Thinking'</p><P>(Author notes)</p><P>-----------------------------------------</p><P>It was close to
supper when Naruto left the safety of his bedroom to the eerily quiet
living room. When he went out there, he found Kyuubi still on his
laptop but no longer writing his story. He walked over to the red
head that seemed to be in deep with his reading, but he had to break
the silence to ask this very important question.</p><P>"What'd you
want for supper?" Naruto asked waiting for a reply.</p><P>Kyuubi looked up
for a minute but then continued to read. Naruto, not liking to be
ignored, decided to ask again. When Kyuubi ignored him yet again,
which made Naruto very mad, he yelled out the question again.</p><P>"I'm.not.hungry."
Kyuubi said in a monotone voice.</p><P>"... But...
I can hear your stomach growling…" Naruto said confused cocking
his head to the side.</p><P>Silent spread
through out the room when Naruto said that. The silence stretched for
a good, five minutes until Kyuubi broke it.</p><P>"So, ignore
it 'cause I said I'm not hungry." Kyuubi said but his stomach
betrayed him and gave a loud growl in protest.</p><P>Naruto stared at
the kitsune in front of him and said, "I'll fix us some ramen
since it's really the only thing I know how to fix." Naruto
then wondered off into the kitchen to prepare their meal.</p><P>After like ten
minutes, Naruto came out with two bowls of ramen. He set his down on
the table and brought Kyuubi's to him.</p><P>"Here's
your ramen, made by the great Uzumaki Naruto." He gave a foxy
smirk after saying that and held out the bowl to the other.</p><P>Kyuubi looked up
and slowly took the bowl and looking over it when he got it.</p><P>"Don't
worry, I didn't poison it." Naruto then got his food, sat next
to Kyuubi, and began his loud slurping.</p><P>Kyuubi stared in
at the blonde next to him wondering who gave him the ok to sit next
to him and, why he has to eat so... Sloppy. Unlike Naruto, Kyuubi ate
his food slowly, taking his time. After ten agonizing minutes, Kyuubi
was finally done and Naruto asked one of the questions that had been
on his mind for a while.</p><P>"Oi Kyuu."
Naruto said to get the other attention but the shortening of Kyuubi's
name made him twitch at him, "What do you look so... I dunno...
depressed? Everyone has there story so I wanna know yours."</p><P>"You have
no right to ask me something like that and it is disrespectful to
shorten someone's name if you barely know them." Kyuubi
responded in an icy tone, then looked away from the blonde and got
out his sketches.</p><P>"I just
wanted to know..." Naruto mumbled but still knowing the one
beside him heard him.</p><P>As the hours
went by Naruto tried to talk to Kyuubi only to be ignored or glared
at harshly, and let's not forget the threatening words of "If
you don't shut the fuck up right now I'll rip your mouth off and
throw it to the dogs." Yep, Naruto sure was becoming great
friends with the red haired kitsune.</p><P>Naruto sighed
and turned towards the clock realizing it was time for his favorite
show but before he could grab the remote Kyuubi had it in his long,
delicate, and graceful fingered hands. He changed it to the show
Naruto was just about to watch himself, Inuyasha (I say they watch
Inuyasha 'cause it's awesome).</p><P>"You like
this show to!" Naruto said in childish wonderment his tail
wagging back and forth.</p><P>"Hn"
Kyuubi answered his ears twitching at the sound of Naruto's voice on
the show he watches, "Got a problem with it."</p><P>"Nooo, I
love this show! It totally rocks!" Naruto punched his fist into
the air.</p><P>They sat in
silence as they watched the episode, watching Inuyasha and Koga fight
again, Naruto laughing on every part he found humorous, and Kyuubi
staring intently at the screen but throwing occasional glances at the
blonde beside him. The show was over as fast it had come on, which
had Naruto asking what parts Kyuubi liked and what parts he thought
they should have improved. Kyuubi ignored him of course though.</p><P>"Why won't
you talk to me?" Naruto asked crossing his arms in frustration,
"No matter how hard I try you wont say anything... if you do
it's not much..."</p><P>"... I
don't like you or want to be around you at all... I also hate your
apartment." Kyuubi was about to get his laptop out when the
little kitsune hanyou tackled him to the floor.</p><P>Naruto wrestled
Kyuubi to the floor, which wasn't to hard since Kyuubi was too
shocked to move. They lied there like that until Kyuubi started to
struggle to get Naruto off him. Trying to get free of the blonde's
clutches wasn't too hard since Kyuubi was a lot stronger then the
other.</p><P>"You little
fucker." Kyuubi's ears lied back on his head, his tails swishing
back and forth in rage, he lunged forward pinning down the screaming
blond.</p><P>Naruto struggled
for his life knowing something might happen if he didn't do
something, but, some how he felt safe, as if knowing Kyuubi wouldn't
try and kill him this time. He relaxed within the grip on his neck,
slowly breathing in and out.</p><P>Kyuubi was
pretty puzzled at the reaction of this, usually people would be
begging for mercy but this one wasn't. Kyuubi stared into the crystal
blue eyes of the young kitsune underneath him. The smell of oranges
rolled off him in waves.</p><P>Naruto starring
up into eyes of dark blood, breathe warm on his face, and the smell
of cinnamon clinging on him. He couldn't resist going closer to the
beautiful face above him, his soft pink lips and whiskers that make
him look wild and dangerous. Leaning closer and closer until...</p><P>----------------------------------------------</p><P>Sorry I had to do a cliffy. I know I've
tortured you all a lot for waiting for this chapter, but I think you
can wait a little longer. Now: Will Naruto kiss this dangerous,
beautiful, mysterious, kitsune? Or! Will Kyuubi push away in time?
OR! Will Naruto realize what he's doing in time to stop himself? Keep
watching to find out! AND... REVIEW!!!! The more reviews the quicker
I'll update... or try…</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P>Now lets see if
Naru gets to kiss Kyuu! Well a lot of you said you wanted them to
kiss and... it wont happen... haha! joking... lets just get on
with it. Sorry for it being short but I had to get something up.</p><P>"Talking"</p><P>'Thinking'</p><P>(Author Notes)</p><P>--------------------------------------------------</p><P>It seemed to go
on forever but their lips finally met. They both opened their eyes at
the same time, Naruto's cerulean eyes looking into Kyuubi's blood
eyes, Kyuub's eyes widened a fraction, he panicked. Kyuubi thrashed
widely throwing Naruto off of him and he ran out the door out into
the night. Naruto stood up shakily and ran after the frightened
kitsune.</p><P>Kyuubi ran
faster and faster until his his paniced mind calmed. When his he
finally stopped he noticed he'd ran into the woods to the lake he
used to go to when he was younger.</p><P>"And
happy," Kyuubi remarked to himself.</p><P>He was not sure
as to why he ran here. But memories of the past came back to haunt
him, memeories of his happiness, his laughter, his smiles, his
innocense. He frowned at his reflection in the water.</p><P>How much he had
changed since his childhood. His face no longer chubby, his whisker
marks more prominent, eyes darker and filled with sorrow and hate,
his tall slim form, shaggier hair that had darken over the years, and
the scars that now adorned his arms. Those same scars that are on his
arms that show physical pain, represent the emotional pain on the
inside.</p><P>Kyuubi's
thoughts were interrupted by the rustling of the bushes and low
curses. He turned around to find the same blond that triggered his
panic, kyuubi became tense and catious.</p><P>"There you
are, man, you run really fast you know." Naruto said, his hand
rubbing the back of his head showing his discomfort, "Hehehe...
I-I'm sorry for what happened... I didn't mean to do <I>that</I>..."</p><P>Naruto fidgeted
under the intense gaze of Kyuubi, Naruto blushed when he found he was
starring. Kyuubi sat on the rock by the lake starring at the
fidgeting blond kitsune with interest at what he was saying.</p><P>"Go on."
Kyuubi said in his cold voice.</p><P>"Uh, ah
ok... Well it's just that your really interesting and I wanted to
know more about you and I guess I got carried away and and... you
look so lonely dressed like an emo and you never really talk that I
kinda lost track of my actions so I hope your not angry..."
Naruto said in a paniced rush.</p><P>Kyuubi blinked a
couple of times... his eyes drooped with boredom and aswered, "So
your saying that I'm a pathetic emo and your taking pity on me."</p><P>"Ah! No! No
no no! I don't mean it like that... it's just." Naruto waved his
arms up and down in panic, he dropped his arms to his side and gave a
sigh, "Forget it, I give up."</p><P>Kyuubi gave a
light chuckle that sounded to creepy to Naruto, got off the rock, and
started to head back to the blond's house. Naruto, a little confused,
followed along with Kyuubi. The two didn't talk the whole way there
and they went to bed.</p><P>Kyuubi of course
didn't dare to sleep, to many thoughts were going on his head that
could cause a nightmare. He was on his laptop for the rest of the
night.</p><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------</p><P>I know... sucky
ending... but atleast I tried and I am sorry for making you all wait
so fucking long... I'm a horrible author for making you all wait so I
give you all cookies! I will get the next one done soon! If I don't I
shall make you guys a story of your choosing... yes if I don't get
the next chapter up by Friday then you get to choose a pairing and
I'll do a story. Ok later peeps!</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><P>Kyuubi is around
nine in this fic... I have to warn you guys that this isn't the
prettiest chapter ever... It's more about Kyuubi remembering his
past... a nightmare... it has rape in it... I'm practicing with
POVs... I don't think it's that good but this is the longest chapter
that I've written on here... well enjoy. I'll warn you when the rape
is coming!</p><P>"Talking"</p><P>'Thinking'</p><P>--------------------------------------------------<BR>Kyuubi
tried so hard not to fall to sleep but he failed when his eyes
closed. His nightmare began as it always did. The same place and the
same time.</p><P>Kyuubi
POV<p>'I've always loved the snow. It's just so white, just like
my mom's hair.'<p></p><P>While looking
outside the window, my nine fluffy tails swayed behind me. I
<BR>couldn't help but let a small smile show, it was almost
Christmas. Christmas was my favorite holiday, from eating all the
delicious food my mom made to getting gifts.<p>"Kyuubi! Can
you come help me?!" Shouted my mom from the kitchen.<p>I
sighed showing my irritation of being disturbed but went anyway. I'd
<BR>do anything for mom.<p>As I entered the kitchen I was
greeted with smells, that my super<BR>sensitive nose could pick up,
of my mom's delicious home cooked meals. She was<BR>currently
sitting down getting a drink, her long beautiful white<BR>hair was
in a bun, a pink apron, covering her T-shirt and jeans, that
was<BR>covered in flour. She also had flour on her pale skin, her
white<BR>fluffy tails dirty with dough stuck in the fur, her kitsune
ears drooping in<BR>weariness, and bags under her ruby eyes.<p>"Yes
mom, what did you want?" I asked walking towards her my big
blood<BR>red eyes looking into her more brighter eyes. I sometimes
wonder why mine<BR>were darker; they made me look scary
sometimes.<p>"I just wanted to see you and wanted your
insight on how my cookies<BR>taste, oh-dear-son-of-mine." My
mom said with a smile gracing her perfect face<BR>while she ruffled
my spikey crimson hair.<p>"Ok." I said taking a bite
out of her cookies. I hummed my approval to<BR>her and she smiled
with pride. "Your cookies are always the best you know."
<BR>My ear twitched and she smiled again then embraced me.<p>"Aaawwww,
you are too nice Kyuu. I just love you to bits." She nuzzled<BR>my
cheek and gave me a quick peck to my nose before she stood up to
finish<BR>cooking.<p>I just watched her and was about to walk
out when she asked me to go<BR>get father. I froze still and turned
around with a frown on my face and my<BR>brows furrowed "Why
must I? Ask one of the others to get him." I wasn't going<BR>to
do it, but my mom turned around and gave me the puppy eyes "...
<BR>Fine, I'll go. But I get ten cookies when I return."<p>"Of
course and thanks Kyuu!" she chirped happily and continued in
<BR>preparing the food.<p>I walked as slow as I could to prolong
the journey to see my dad. My<BR>frown was still there but I was
also chewing my lip and my eyes showed my<BR>fear of seeing my dad.
My father is one of the strongest demons alive and is<BR>probably
the scariest one too.<p>I was finally nearing my destination, my
lip had become red from my<BR>chewing on it and I started shaking
when I was about to turn the door knob. I<BR>remembered one of the
times I went in without knocking and the<BR>punishment I got later
that day. My dad, he beat me. He's beaten me since I was five<BR>and
it seemed lately to have gotten worse.<p>I quickly shook my head
to clear those thoughts and knocked on the<BR>door. I waited for a
good whole five minutes before I heard him tell me I<BR>could enter.
I took a deep breath to calm my breathing and heart. I grabbed<BR>the
door knob, twisted it, and then the door opened to reveal the person
in<BR>most of my nightmares, my dad.<p>"What is it boy. It
better have been important for you to come." He said<BR>with
annoyance clear in his voice. He turned around to face me and I
quickly<BR>began to shake with panic. My dad had dark blood red
hair, ink black<BR>eyes, the wide dark whisker marks like mine,
light tan skin, black talons<BR>like mine too, nine black tails and
the ends were the same color as his<BR>hair, kitsune ears that
twitched with annoyance, and he was wearing a black shirt with blue
jeans on.<p>"U-um... m-mom wanted t-to see you" I was
feeling very panicky at that<BR>moment. I was shaking so much that
my dad could see it and my palms<BR>were sweating, I also found that
the floor was better to look at in this<BR>moment.<p>My father
saw my fear, I knew he could smell it because I could. He<BR>smirked
at this and said to me, "Whats wrong boy. You aren't afraid of
your own father<BR>are you?" The way his eyes shone and his
smile turned predator-like made me<BR>gasp and widen my eyes while
reaching for the door.<p>He saw this and said, "Come here,
now." His voice demanded that I<BR>listen so I did. I walked
slowly taking careful steps to him. His grunt of<BR>annoyance told
me I was going too slow so I ran to him and ended up<BR>tripping
over my own feet landing right in front of him.<p>I looked up
into his menacing gaze and coward before him. I closed my<BR>eyes
tightly and went into a crouched position, I covered my head with my
<BR>small hands, my black claws digging into my poor scalp, and my
tails wrapping<BR>around me.<p>"You better look at me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?"<BR>he said in anger,
glaring down at me. He pulled me up by my hair I<BR>yelped in
pain.<p>"Didn't you hear me." I nodded my head the
best I could with his<BR>death grip on my hair. "Then you look
at me when I'm talking." He<BR>threw me into the wall, my head
made the most contact with the wall<BR>and it started to bleed from
the impact. I begged him not to hurt me, he<BR>came closer but
luckily my mom shouted for my dad and he left but not before<BR>saying,
"We'll finish this later."<p>When he left it felt like
this great weight was lifted off my shoulder<BR>and I gave a sigh of
relief. I took this time to calm down but after my<BR>shaking
subsided I left the room as fast as I could. The rest of the day went
<BR>by smoothly, our Christmas dinner was pretty decent of course me,
my<BR>nii-san, and onee-chan got into a big fight but it was quickly
settled<BR>when my dad stepped in.<p>It was night and that
meant presents tomorrow so I dashed off to my<BR>room and my mom
tucked me in, she said goodnight.<p></p><P>(RAPE IS
BEGINING)</p><p>It wasn't
until midnight when I heard my door open, I turned over<BR>still
half asleep rubbing my eyes with a big yawn. What I saw scared me to
<BR>death... It was him standing right in front of me.<p>"D-dad...
w-what do you want? It's really late so why aren't you asleep<BR>with
mom?" I asked trying to hide my fear from him this time. But
what he<BR>did next hurt... he slapped me and hard enough for my
head to turn<BR>slightly.<p>"Shut up you worthless piece
of shit. You have no right asking me<BR>that." I could feel the
anger and hatred pouring off of him. He was glaring at<BR>me again
but what frightened me was that he was growling and baring his<BR>fangs
at me.<p>"Dad." I squeaked moving to the wall, my ears
down and my tails in<BR>between my legs. I didn't know how it
happened but I found my dad so close to my face<BR>that I could feel
his breath ghosting over my lips. I didn't understand what<BR>he was
doing until he said, "I think I've come up with a new way to
break you<BR>boy, and this time I don't think your mom will be able
to piece back the<BR>pieces." He gave a dark laugh before he
grabbed me by the neck and started to<BR>choke me.<p>My small
hands went around his wrists giving light tugs to try and<BR>convince
him to let go but it didn't work. I started to feel light headed
after<BR>a minute of this and I really didn't feel like dying yet so
without<BR>thinking I scratched my dad's face with as much effort I
could give. It did work<BR>and he retracted his hand hissing in
pain, I sat gasping for air.<p>"I wasn't planning to go too
fast but what you did was the last straw."<BR>He snarled at me
with a fierce look on his face. He grabbed me and threw<BR>me onto
my stomach ripping my shirt off my back leaving scratches but they
quickly healed. He licked the blood off of my back, it made me shiver
to think my own dad is doing this.<p>"Dad? W-what are you
doing?" I asked nervously closing my eyes tightly<BR>and
gripping onto the blankets of my bed.<p>"I'm going to teach
you a lesson you will never forget." His claws<BR>trailed down
my sides and stopped at my pants. I gulped thinking what he was
<BR>going to do now and had a pretty good idea of what he was going
to do but I<BR>still hoped I was wrong. But, God wasn't on my side
tonight, he ripped off my<BR>pants leaving me exposed. I shivered at
the cold and knowing my dad was<BR>starring at me.<p>He leaned
down to whisper in my ear "You know, you are an ugly monster.
<BR>No one likes you, your mother just feels pity for you. How bout I
show you<BR>how filthy and worthless you are?"<p>Could it
be true? Could my mom really hate me? Was my life just full of<BR>lies?
I didn't know if it was true or not but it still hurt to hear it.<p>I
felt my dad's hands grazing the back of my neck and trailing his
<BR>claws down my back while licking the blood from the wounds.<p>I
gasped out in pain and squirmed at the feeling. I was getting mixed
<BR>feelings through out that but it quickly stopped when I felt
something in between my legs. I jumped in surprise at the feeling and
tried to get up but was held down by my father's other hand. It
felt weird and uncomfortable but... it started to feel better and it
did get better.<p>I really didn't know how my body worked but it
got hard down there and<BR>it made me whimper at my dad's strokes.
He stroked it from base to tip,<BR>swiping his thumb over the top a
couple of times.<p>This weird pressure started to develop in my
stomach and it grew more<BR>and more until it was released. This...
white stuff came out on my dad's<BR>hand and my blankets, my dad
removed his hand from there, I was panting<BR>from the powerful
sensation.<p>My father flipped me over and I stared up into his
eyes... They looked<BR>darker, full of this weird emotion that I
have never seen.<p>He looked at me and put his hand with the
white stuff on it in front of<BR>my face and said, "Lick it off
now." I didn't understand but it smelled<BR>weird to me and I
really didn't feel like licking it off. "You dirtied my hand.
<BR>Now make it clean by licking it off."<p>He had that
tone in his voice and I decided it would be a good idea to<BR>do
what he said so I came forward a bit and licked some of it. It tasted
<BR>weird and I didn't really like it but I continued to lick it off
until his<BR>hand was clean.<p>He looked at me like he was
going to eat me for a moment but that look<BR>quickly disappeared
and he flipped me over again. I landed on my<BR>stomach with an
"oof" and heard the shuffling of clothes being taken off. I
<BR>looked over my shoulder to find my dad completely naked and
something sticking<BR>up between his legs.<p>He turned my head
around and kissed me hard and when I gasped he forced<BR>his tongue
into my mouth. It was strange and I didn't like my father doing<BR>this
to me so I gave a muffled "stop" but he ignored me. He
finally pulled<BR>back to let me breathe, he then but three fingers
in front of my mouth and<BR>said "Suck." I still didn't
understand that well of what was going on so I opened my mouth, he
put his fingers in it, and then I started to suck coating his fingers
in my spit.<p>He removed his fingers from my mouth and grabbed
my hips, lifting me<BR>so my butt would be in the air. It did
embarrass me but that quickly faded<BR>when I felt something pushing
into my small entrance, which were his three fingers, he<BR>thrusted
them in. I screamed full of pain but my dad muffled<BR>it by shoving
my face against the pillow.<p>It hurt so much, more than
anything I've ever felt before. I started to<BR>cry because it hurt
so much. I felt the fingers stretch me inside and it<BR>started to
hurt even more. His claws scratched me from there and I could feel
<BR>some blood going down my leg. My cries were not heard but the
pain soon<BR>stopped, I tried to ignore it. When the fingers were
removed I<BR>thought it was over but then I felt something even
larger at my entrance.<p>My dad sheathed himself all the way
inside me, it felt like I was being<BR>torn in two. I opened my
mouth for a scream but nothing came out. The tears<BR>flowed down my
cheeks but my dad didn't care he pulled out and drove<BR>back in
again and again. It kept getting rougher.<p>I yelled with tears
still coming down my face "Please dad! Stop! It<BR>hurts!
Please! I'm sorry I'm sorry I'll be good I promise just please stop!"
<BR>But he ignored me and kept it up.<p>"God. You are so
tight and hot." My dad said thrusting in harder. He<BR>was
panting and moaning with his sweaty chest rubbing against my back. I
<BR>thought it was going to go on forever but just when I was about
to give up I<BR>felt something warm shoot into me. There was so much
that some of it ran down<BR>my legs.<p>My father pulled out of
me and I collapsed on my side. I could feel it<BR>pouring out,
mixing with my blood. My tears still going down my cheeks<BR>but, I
didn't care. I was too tired and hurt to care. My father gave one
last<BR>look at me saying, "You really are nothing but a dirty
monster. I hope<BR>you remember this son, this will be your
punishment and it will only<BR>get worse and worse the more you mess
up." He then walked out of my room.<p>His words echoed
throughout my head until I finally fell asleep, still<BR>crying.</p><P>(THE RAPING IS
OVER)</p><P>Kyuubi awoke,
panting from his nightmare. He wiped the sweat from his forhead, his
breathing going back to normal. He looked at the clock to find it to
be six O'clock in the morning. He'd be going to school soon, that
means the blond would be waking up soon. He got up to take a shower,
taking the supplies he needed for this task. It was going to be a
long day.</p><P>-----------------------------------------------------</p><P>Just like I
promised! The other should be up either Friday or earlier... not
totally sure but I hope you enjoyed this chapter... I think this is
one of my best ones! Review or... Naruto shall cry and I'll sick
Kyuubi's dad on you!</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 10</h3><hr><br><P>I had intense
writers block but I have my inspiration back to finish this chapter!
I know... I ish a baaaad person for making you all wait... I'm
ashamed with myself... but here's this chapter! Enjoy! It has not
been beta'd. I don't want a beta cause I would end up making that
person wait on me forever like my last one... so I don't care if
they're mistakes!</p><P>"Talking"</p><P>'Thinking'</p><P>(author notes)</p><P>-----------------------------------------------------------</p><P>Naruto's alarm
clock buzzed with life making the little foxy wake from his peaceful
slumber. But this time Naruto actually got up. He yawned and
stretched his arms up twords the ceiling. Then he went to take a
shower and got ready.</p><P>When he was
heading out he finally remembered Kyuubi and looked in his small
apartment for him, only to find nothing.</p><P>'He must have
already gone.' Naruto thought to himself, shrugging he went off to
school.</p><P>He walked to
school deep in thought, wondering about why he kissed the red head
last night. He didn't even know that much about Kyuubi, so why would
he do that.</p><P>Naruto reached
school only to be greeted by his... nervous... looking best friend.
Usually Gaara is a very calm person, but this one actually was
showing emotion.</p><P>"I know,
suprised that I survived some how." Naruto replied to Gaara who
nodded in agreement, " I know... me too."</p><P>They walked in
the hallway to Naruto's locker so he could put his stuff away and get
the rest.</p><P>"Soooo...
how was it last night with Shukaku?" Naruto asked giving a
mishevious smile, "Did you guys, I don't know, do <I>anything</I>."</p><P>This earned him
a glare and a bump on the head. Gaara walked off to their class.</p><P>"Wait! I'm
sorry Gaara! Wait!" Naruto shouted after his friend.</p><P>It wasn't till
lunch that Gaara finally excepted Naruto's apology. But their
peaceful coversation didn't last for long. Shukaku decided to join
it.</p><P>"Whats up!"
Shukaku had a mishevious smile gracing his features.</p><P>Naruto felt
kinda worried, "Nothing, just talking... why are you over
here?"</p><P>"Welll...
just wondering what happened to you and Kyuubi last night."
Shukaku replied, "I've never seen him in such deep thought...
it's kinda creepy! he wont even make fun of me or hurt me like he
usually does!"</p><P>Gaara just
shrugged and Naruto just looked confused. Shukaku gave up on trying
to figure out what happened and went on to a different subject.</p><P>"So Gaara,
did you enjoy last night." Shukaku asked suggestively, his tail
wagging.</p><P>"I knew
something happened!" Naruto pointed smiling.</p><P>Gaara's face
turned bright red and glared at his older brother with his death
glare of doom. Gaara punched Shukaku in the face and stomped off in a
different direction. Shukaku yelped in pain and held his nose.</p><P>"Goddamnit!
Kyuubi! Heal my nose please!" Shukaku went off in a search for
the fox, holding his injured nose.</p><P>Naruto was bored
and decided to follow Shukaku to see if he got in trouble with Kyuubi
and got hurt more. Shukaku always seemed to get hurt one way or the
other. But what he found was much different.</p><P>It was Kyuubi
but he and Yonbi looked pretty pissed off. They were glaring at a
group of humans. But the one who looked the most pissed off was
Yonbi.</p><P>Yonbi was pretty
scary looking to Naruto. He had auburn hair, dark tan skin, pretty
big muscles, brownish red eyes, and he was really tall. He was a
strange demon, a dragon kind that looked to be half bird also. He's a
pretty easy going guy and was actually kinda nice, he helped Naruto
once when he was being picked on.</p><P>"Whats
going on?" Naruto asked someone close to him.</p><P>"It seems
like someone from the Akatsuki hurt Yonbi's boyfriend." the girl
said.</p><P>The Akatsuki was
another gang that wanted to surpass the Bijuu. Yonbi's boyfriend
happened to be Sanbi, the three tailed one. They were very close to
eachother.</p><P>Sanbi is also
pretty nice when you get to know him. He has aqua blue colored hair,
dark blue eyes, pale skin that seemed kinda blue if you were up close
to him, tall also but not as tall as Yonbi, and he was a sort of
shark demon.</p><P>"Where is
he." Yonbi dangerously growled, his four tails slithering in an
angry manner.</p><P>"Don't have
to tell you hn." Deidara(I forgot if this is the right way to
spell his name and what he says at the end of his words?) said with a
smirk.</p><P>Deidara, Sasori,
Itachi, and Kisame were the only Akatsuki group memebers around right
now. But even with that few if Yonbi tried to hurt Deidara Sasori
would help out. They'd do anything to try and take one of the Bijuu
out.</p><P>"Wait... if
they don't know where Sanbi is then he's still in trouble."
Naruto told himself, "I have to help find him."</p><P>Naruto started
off in a different direction then where the others were. Naruto
headed to where Sasuke usually is. He looked all over the courtyard
to find raven haired teme. He finally laid eyes on him and ran at
full speed toward him. He skidded to a halt and started talking to
fast for even Sasuke to understand.</p><P>"Shut up
dobe and say it slowly." Sasuke sighed in annoyance.</p><P>Naruto to a
calming breath and explained it the best he could.</p><P>"You want
me to tell you where my brother's gang hangs out... your joking."</p><P>"I am so
not joking Sasuke-teme!" Naruto yelled glaring at him.</p><P>"I can't
tell you. My brother would kill me." Sasuke glared at Naruto.</p><P>"Come on!
They could kill him!" Naruto yelled but got an idea in his head,
"Well if they kill him you don't have to worry about Itachi
coming after you. Just a very angry demon who happens to be thr four
tailed one, I'll even tell him how to find you."</p><P>Naruto smirked
in victory when he saw the look in Sasuke's eyes and knew he won this
time. Sasuke explained where to find it and Naruto ran off to find
Gaara.</p><P>It wasn't that
hard to find Gaara. But trying to get him to help free Sanbi from the
Akatsuki was another story.</p><P>"Please
Gaara! I need your help!" Naruto whined.</p><P>"No, I'm
not going to get myself killed." Gaara replied in a stoic
manner.</p><P>"But then
the Bijuu would owe us big time! They wouldn't pick on us!"
Naruto exclaimed in determination.</p><P>Gaara sighed and
finally agreed. Naruto whooped in victory and dragged Gaara off to
the hideout of the Akatsuki.</p><P>-------------------------------</p><P>Finally done! I
hope you enjoyed and I had to end it right there. Can't let it go on
forever. But pray to god to hope I get the next chapter up soon! I
want to say thank you for all your reviews! They finally knocked some
sense into me and got me to finish this chapter! Thank you for the
support and for liking my story! I will be trying to update my series
of one-shots of Kyuubi and Arashi!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 11</h3><hr><br><P>Yay!
Another one! .... well.... here it
is....<p>"Talking"<BR>'Thinking'<BR>(author
notes)<p>They
were close, Naruto could just feel it. He looked around very
cautiously, keeping his ears alert. Naruto portrayed the hero about
to rescue the maiden in distsress and Gaara was the nervous side kick
who looked like he wanted to turn around right now.<p>"Come
on, it's just a little further." Naruto whispered to the red
head.<p>The red head did not reply but hesitatingly
followed his friend.<p>They were in a desserted parking lot to
a, supposedly, empty building. Naruto could smell and hear the other
people in there. Including the shouting that was more than likely
Sanbi. They inched closer to the window to peek inside to see if
anyone was in there. There didn't seem to be anyone there, but
knowing the Akatsuki they planned some sort of trap. Naruto eased
through a crack in the wall and pulled Gaara through with him.<p>They
crept carefully through the building until they came upon Sanbi tied
to a pillar with strange ropes that were tied around him, he also
seemed to be blind folded. Naruto went up to Sanbi and was about to
cut the rope when he heard a muffled cry come from behind him. He
turned around to see another Akatsuki member holding Gaara
captive.<p>Naruto growled showing his small canines at the
man in front of him, whom was Hidan by the scythe that leaned against
the wall close to them. He looked at Sanbi and debated with himself
to either let him lose or get Gaara first. Naruto knew he should have
thought more but the look on his best friends face had him rushing
towards Hidan only to be caught by another Akatsuki member.<p>He
thrashed to try and get away from the man behind him but he was only
held tighter till he could barely breathe. Naruto stopped his
movements and looked to Gaara who seemed indifferent, but Naruto
could see the fear in his friends eyes.<p>"What are
you little fuckers doing here." Hidan said sneering at
them.<p>Naruto didn't answer at first until he was
squeezed tighter, "W-we wanted to help S-sanbi."<p>"Well
your shit out of luck, now aren't you." Hidan said
smirking.<p>"What are y-you going to do t-to us?"
Naruto squeaked out in fear.<p>"You'll see."
Hidan said grabbing his scythe.<p>Gaara began to struggle
more and tried to scratch Hidan to death but he was pinned to the
ground within a second under Hidan. Hidan raised his scythe higher
and was about to bring it down when it seemed as if it was unable to
move. The Akatsuki member looked back and saw something red and
transparent around his scythe to stop it's movements. He looked to
where the string connected and saw a pair of glowing red
eyes.<p>"W-who the f-fuck are you!" Hidan
stuttered out.<p>"Who do you think I am." The
voice said in a sadistic voice.<p>from the shadow Kyuubi
emerged with his tails thrashing around wildly in anger. He smirked
again at the now frightened human. He brought up his clawed hand, but
before he could do anything the two Akatsuki members ran off. Kyuubi
frowned in disappointment until he saw Sanbi tied up. He moved
towards his friend and undid his bindings.<p>"Thanks
Kyuubi." Sanbi said in relief.<p>"Hmph,
whatever. Get back to Yonbi, he's pretty pissed off." Kyuubi
said crossing his arms over his chest.<p>Sanbi got up and
dashed off to get back to school and his seething boyfriend. That
left Kyuubi, Naruto, and Gaara all alone. Naruto looked up at Kyuubi
and gave him one of his biggest smiles to the other kitsune. Kyuubi
glared down at the blond and Gaara just sat there on the floor to
calm down from his excitement for the day. Things like this seemed to
happen when he was around Naruto and he should be used to it by
now.<p>"Oi, how did you find us?" Naruto asked
cocking his head to the side in a cute fashion.<p>"I
followed your scent, duh baka." Kyuubi said starting to walk
off.<p>Naruto turned to Gaara who only nodded, got up, and
started walking home. Gaara new he wouldn't want to go back to
school after this. The little blond kitsune saw his friend give him
the ok and he started to follow red head. This of course only pissed
said red head off and he quickened his pace. But this only encouraged
Naruto to follow faster and then they were racing off down the
streets into a park.<p>Kyuubi finally got annoyed at the
blond so he stopped and turned only to have Naruto run into him and
fall on his poor butt. Naruto peeked up at Kyuubi to see the red head
pretty mad at him for following him when it was obviously not
welcomed.</P><P>"Why
are you following me." Kyuubi hissed out with his ears pressed
back against his head.</P><P>"U-um
I j-just wanted to um... hang out?" Naruto whispered the last
part.</P><P>Kyuubi
stared at Naruto what felt like hours to the poor blond before
finally looking away and sitting down on a near by bench. The red
haired kitsune glanced at Naruto then away. Naruto smiled, got up,
and walked with his tail wagging toward Kyuubi. Kyuubi sighed at the
smaller ones weird antics, then just leaned against the bench and
looked towards the sky.</P><P>Naruto
looked at the nine tailed kitsune beside him. The sun was making his
pale skin look even whiter, the whiskers even darker. He then looked
into Kyuubi's dark red eyes that reflected the sky in them, making it
look as if the sky was a blood red.</P><P>Naruto
smiled and gave a contented sigh and continued to stare at the fox in
front of him. Kyuubi could feel the blond's blue eyes on him and then
turned his gaze to Naruto. Red met blue again, making Naruto blush a
delicate pink at knowing Kyuubi saw him staring.</P><P>Naruto
wanted to say something to get the other to talk. To get rid of this
uncomfortable silence that has now enveloped them.</P><P>'Wait,
why am I being so shy! I feel like Hinata now...' Naruto thought
gazing into blood red orbs.</P><P>Naruto's
eyes suddenly shined with determination, which made Kyuubi a little
nervous at the look in the blond's eyes. The blond kitsune swallowed
and then leaned toward Kyuubi. Inching closer, and closer; their lips
mere centimeters apart. Kyuubi's eyes widened at Narutos bold move to
try and kiss him again. His instincts told him to move, to not let
the blond brat near him. But he ignored them and waited to see if the
younger kitsune had enough courage to actually do it.</P><P>He
did. Naruto's and Kyuubi's lips met for the second time. It was a
soft kiss, testing the feeling. When their lips did touch it sent
small shivers through both of the teenage males. Naruto slid his eyes
shut and Kyuubi did the same.</P><P>Naruto
pushed against Kyuubi's lips to urge the other to deepen the kiss.
Kyuubi responded by opening his mouth and running his tongue along
Naruto's bottom lip trying to gain access. Naruto gave a small moan
and opened his mouth for the older kitsune. The red heads tongue
delve into Naruto's moist cavern and explored around, experienceing
taste he didn't understand.</P><P>Naruto
shyly touched his tongue to the others and they started to lose
themselves in the new experience. Naruto wrapped his arms around
Kyuubi's neck and Kyuubi wrapped his arms around Naruto's to bring
him closer.</P><P>They
finally pulled apart for air only to go back to kissing the other.
Naruto decided it was his turn to explore Kyuubi's mouth and mewled
at the the sensation. Kyuubi groaned at the noises the blond was
making. He couldn't take it anymore but he didn't want to go any
farther.</P><P>Kyuubi
pulled away from Naruto who gave a whimper at the loss. Kyuubi's face
was flushed pink as was Naruto's and they were panting a bit. Kyuubi
gave a nervous look to the blond.</P><P>"I-
I gotta go.... it's.. late." Kyuubi made up and ran out of the
park.</P><P>Naruto
sighed as he saw kitsune leave. He felt sad at seeing him go but was
happy about his accomplishment. He, had just kissed one of the most
feared demons in his high school, and he lived. But why did Kyuubi
make up an excuse to leave him there. It wasn't late, actually school
just ended!</P><P>He
was very confused and he decided something. He would go to Shukaku's
house and ask him about Kyuubi. Shukaku seemed to be Kyuubi's closest
friend by the way the tanuki can tease the kitsune and only get
injured mildly.</P><P>Naruto
got off the bench and gave it one last look before he headed off
towards Gaara's older brothers house. He hoped that he wouldn't walk
in on something... interesting. Gaara did always go to Shukaku's
house after school didn't he. Oh well, what he sees he sees. Then he
can make fun of Gaara later.</P><P>Thanks
for reading this you guys…. And for Kaiyoshi for your message. Your
right I should have updated sooner. But It was hard, my parents don't
like what I write so I have to do it with out them knowing. But no
more excuses! I will try and get the next chapter up by Sunday! I say
try cause who knows what my parents might do. Bye!</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 12</h3><hr><br><P>Author
note is at bottom! Sorry it's
short!<p>"talking"<BR>'thinking'<p>As
Naruto jogged to Shukaku's house his mind kept wandering back to the
kiss. He was so confused! The poor blond kit just didn't know what to
do anymore. The kiss was amazing for sure! But he was confused by the
older kitsunes behavior. It seemed he could get closer to him, but as
soon as he got to close Kyuubi would just push him away.<p>'What
am I going to do!' Naruto thought as he continued his journey, 'I
barely know him! I've already kissed him two times!'<p>Naruto
didn't realize that in all his thought he wasn't heading towards
Gaara's older brothers house. He was actually heading to the place
were Kyuubi had run off to the first time he tried to kiss him. The
blond came to this conclusion when he ran into a tree and looked
around his surroundings.<p>'Why'd I come here? Guess I
might as well sit for awhile...' Naruto thought sitting on the rock
beside the lake.<p>A sigh escaped his lips as he glanced
over the surface of water. It was so peaceful here; he understood now
why Kyuubi would run to this place. He got out his phone out of his
pocket and decided he'd call Gaara and ask if he could just talk to
Shukaku.<p>He heard nothing but ringing and was about to
hang up until he heard an out of breath hello.<p>"Um...
hope I'm not interrupting anything but I was wondering if I could
talk to your brother.... unless your <i>busy</i>."
Naruto said with a suggestive grin coming to his face.<p><i>"N-no!
We're not d-doing anything! But whatever.... here's
Shukaku..."</i><p>Naruto
could here some complaining and moving around before the older tanuki
demons deep voice echoed from the phone.<p><i>"What
do you want shrimp!"</i><p>"Seems
like I did interrupt something!"<p><i>"Whatever!
Come one and hurry up! What is so important that you actually want to
talk to me!"</i><p>"Welllllll.....
It's about Kyuubi.."<p><i>"What
about him! What happened is he al-"</i><p>"Calm
down! He's fine! I just.... wanted to ask some questions about
him..."<p><i>"Why
would you want to know?"</i><p>"I'm
just curious! He just acts weird in.... certain situations!"
Naruto blushed at mentioning this and decided that he shouldn't
have said that.<p><i>"Oooohhhhh....
Seems like someone likes a certain red head!"</i><p>"Quit
the teasing and just answer my damn questions!" Naruto
snarled.<p><i>"FINE!
Buuuuut depends what they are because some things I can't tell you
cause that would be mean..... and I'm not a mean person."</i><p>Naruto
heard a chuckle come from what he guessed to be Gaara and a hushed
'shut up' from Shukaku.<p>"Ok..... just tell me what
you can. Um... well... why does he get to so... nervous when you get
to close?"<p><i>"Hmmmm....
lets see... how to answer. Everyone has personal space issues.
Kyuubi's is just more serious.... lets just say some thing happened
in his family that caused it."</i><p>"Like
what?" Naruto asked feeling excited he'd finally have a clue on
why the red-eyed fox acts the way he does.<p><i>"I
can't go into detail... I'm not too sure of it myself. You see he's
never told me everything, but I have guessed to what it might be. I
think I'm right, but I hope I'm not."</i><p>"Shukaku,
what did you guess.." Naruto sounded nervous.<p><i>"Well
I think he might have been ra-"</i><p>The
phone was suddenly taken from the blond when he looked up and blue
met red again. Kyuubi put the phone to his ear and calmly talked into
it.<p>"You know Shukaku, you've got a big mouth."
He then closed the phone.<p>Naruto nervously looked to
Kyuubi only to see the red head eerily calm. Red eyes turned to him
slowly and he swallowed the lump that was forming in his throat. He
didn't know what the red head was thinking but he was prepared to run
if necessary.<p>Kyuubi took a step forward only to have
Naruto lung into a sprint to get away. But he was tackled to the
ground without even taken to steps. The air rushed out of him as he
landed on his face. He struggled with all his might to get the other
off but it was all in vain. Even though Kyuubi was small and lithe he
was still bigger than Naruto was.<p>The red head bent his
head so his lips were touching the outside of Naruto's ear. His warm
breath washing over the sensitive fox ear.<p>"What is
with you? Why all the questions? The advancements!?!" Kyuubi
hissed out, his voice getting angrier."Why! Why do you want to
know so much about me!"<p>Kyuubi lifted up enough to
flip then other over only to sit back down so the younger kit could
not run. His narrowed red-eyes starred into scarred blue. The blue
ones just starred into the red depths, searching for some
thing.<p>Naruto peered more into the others eyes,
searching. Looking through all the anger, confusion, and sadness to
see a scarred little boy that just wanted understanding. He reached
his hand up and put his sun kissed hand to Kyuubi's snow-white
cheek.<p>Kyuubi's eyes closed, relishing in the warmth and
comfort from another. It should have felt weird to him; it did when
others touched him. But not when this young boy did it. It felt
natural; it felt as good as breathing after holding your breath fro a
long time!<p>He felt at peace with himself for the first
time after so long! He didn't want this moment to end he wanted to be
selfish and keep it! His eyes started to sting, and he felt some
thing warm slide down his face. He opened his eyes to find his vision
blurred by, tears?<p>His body started to shake with the
silent sobs. He bent his head down, resting it on the blonds
shoulder. Releasing all his stress and sorrow to this one kitsune
hanyou that he barely knew. Yet at the same time felt as if he knew
all his life.<p>Naruto put his arms around Kyuubi, as if
trying to shelter him from his pain. He rubbed soothing circles onto
his back and started to hum some song that popped into his mind. He
didn't know where the song came from, it just formed. They stayed
that way for
hours.<p>------------------------------------------<p>Gomen!
I know... short.. and after such a long wait. But my computer has a
virus... and keeps getting them... so it's hard to post right now.

inspired to write after reading such a wonderful story! Cherry Soda

<br><br><h3>Chapter 13</h3><hr><br><p>I know… I told you I'd update soon but you see… the moment I say that I would… our computer gets attacked by a bunch of viruses and we didn't have virus protection… I find it very ironic. But you're all pretty pissed aren't you. So I hope this chapter is long enough and to make up for it I've added a little something in it!</p><p>Kyuubi: …. Sex?</p><p>Me: Urusai! Just read!</p><p>Kyuubi: But I wanna know! It's been eleven chapters… shouldn't me and Naru have gotten somewhere!?</p><p>Me: I said Urusai! Please enjoy the story!</p><p>"talking"</p><p>'thinking'</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>'It had been a couple of weeks since that incident with me and Kyuubi.' Naruto thought while looking out the window, not paying attention to his teacher. 'Sure, he is a little more open with me and glares a lot less; but, I still wish we could have gotten closer.' Blushing at what closer could mean, Naruto shook his head of the perverse thought. 'I think our gym teacher is rubbing off on me! Damn pervert!'</p><p>The bell had finally rung to signal the end of their class and the beginning of his lunch. Naruto walked out into the hallway easily finding his red headed friend. But as soon as he spotted him he saw his friends clinging older brother with him.</p><p>"Shukaku! When are you going to go back to your friends!?" Naruto glared at the taller blond.</p><p>"Aw, Naru-chan do you hate me!" Shukaku pounced Naruto with a hug.</p><p>"No! You're just the most annoying thing I've met since Sasuke-teme!" He pushed the tanuki off of him and glared with more force.</p><p>" I would if Kyuubi didn't throw me away from the table as soon as I sat down! So I blame you for what's happened and therefore will bother you until you convince Kyuu to let me sit with everyone again!" Shukaku pouted to the shorter blond while walking next to Gaara. "Besides! I love spending time with my younger brother!" Shukaku was about to hug Gaara but received a death glare from the other tanuki.</p><p>"Gaara! Get rid of him!" Naruto pleaded to his friend.</p><p>The only response Naruto received was a look that clearly said "your fault." Sighing as the walked into the cafeteria, his blue eyes scanned the area. He saw Kyuubi and the others sitting at their usual table. Looking at Shukaku he could tell how much he really did want to sit with his friends; and considering it was his fault too for getting the tanuki kicked out of the group.</p><p>"Fine, I'll talk to him after school."</p><p>"Really! Arigato blondy!" Shukaku hugged Naruto again.</p><p>"Yeah yeah, now put me down!"</p><p>The rest of the school day seemed to go by in a blur, and then the kitsune hanyou had to find Kyuubi. Running out the building as fast as his legs could carry him he made it outside and waited for the red head to show. Everyone went by, some waving to Naruto, others glaring at him, but he still hadn't seen Kyuubi.</p><p>'Maybe he already left? No, I made sure I got out way before most of everyone.' Naruto thought while scanning the crowd some more. He spotted Sanbi and Yonbi coming out though, 'I'll ask them where Kyuubi is! Sanbi is really nice and especially since I saved him!'</p><p>Naruto ran up to the two demons, "Have either of you seen Kyuubi? I need to talk to him."</p><p>"Oh! Hello Naruto-kun, It's nice to see you again. I think Kyuubi is in the library." Sanbi smiled kindly at the young boy.</p><p>"Arigato! It was nice to see you as well!" Naruto smiled brightly and then sped off to the library.</p><p>"That kid is weird." Yonbi said grabbing Sanbi's hand.</p><p>"Hai, but he is nice and Kyuubi does seem a lot happier now." Sanbi looked into Yonbi's strangely colored eyes.</p><p>"True." Yonbi smiled to his shorter boyfriend.</p><p>Naruto ran down the hallway almost running people over, causing lots of shouts of "oi!" and "gomen!" Finally reaching his destination Naruto slowed his pace and started to look for the familiar red hair. Ten minutes had passed since he started looking and he tried to sniff him out but the dusty smell of old books was to overwhelming. Letting out a sigh he trudged to the back of the library hoping that the nine-tailed kitsune would be there. Peeking from behind the bookshelf he saw Kyuubi surrounded by books and currently reading one. He gave a mischievous smirk before sneaking behind the chair the red head was currently sitting in.</p><p>"Oi Kyuubi!" Naruto shouted.</p><p>Kyuubi jumped in his seat and made an undignified squeak. Of course that made Naruto fall to the ground laughing his ass off. But once he calmed down to look at Kyuubi he was met with a red in the faced raging kitsune. Naruto made a "eep" noise before fleeing from the onslaught of books being thrown at him. All Kyuubi did was keep muttering "how irritable and annoying the blond was" and "how dare he sneak up on me" among with a lot of cussing.</p><p>"Stop having a hissy fit just caused I scared you!" Naruto shouted at the pissed off kitsune.</p><p>"I am not! Having a hissy fit!" Kyuubi shouted stopping his throwing, "You don't sneak up on people when they're reading!"</p><p>Kyuubi sat back down only to realize the books he was reading were thrown everywhere. He sighed and started to pinch the bridge of his nose, feeling an on coming headache, 'I feel older than what I really am, damn brat.'</p><p>"Since you caused my <i>hissy fit </i>you can pick up all the books and put them back on the table." Kyuubi sent a glare at Naruto.</p><p>"Fine, I guess." He smiled at the still glaring fox. " You know, if you keep furrowing your brow you'll cause wrinkles." Naruto snickered as Kyuubi's glare hardened, "Ok! I'll shut up."</p><p>Silence passed between the two for a couple of minutes before Kyuubi spoke up. "So, what did you want?"</p><p>"Gomen, I thought the great Kyuubi wanted me to shut up." Sarcasm was dripping from every one of the blond's words.</p><p>"Damn brat! Just answer the question!" Kyuubi could feel his head pounding, 'It's always like this when I deal with him, never simple.'</p><p>"Ok, wellll… I wanted to talk about Shukaku." Naruto peeked at Kyuubi while setting more books on the table. 'Geez he reads a lot.'</p><p>"…What about him.." A loom of curiosity crossed Kyuubi's features, while he cocked his head to the side.</p><p>'Kawaii!' Naruto squealed in his head. Not that he'd ever say it out loud. "You see, he's been bugging me and Gaara lately cause you won't let him sit with you cause your mad at him. But you shouldn't blame him for what I asked. So can you let him sit with you again, I'm getting sick of his whining and Gaara already deals with him enough."</p><p>"Hmm I don't know. It has been nicer at the table without him there." Kyuubi nonchalantly looked at his nails while smirking. "Why should I let him sit with us?"</p><p>"Nani!? I just gave you reasons!" Naruto set the rest of the books on the table and put his hands on his hips, his ears flattening on his head. "Don't act innocent with me! I know you're planning something!"</p><p>"Whatever made you think that?" Kyuubi gave him an innocent look, well as innocent as Kyuubi could.</p><p>"Cause you're a kitsune and so am I so I know how our kind works!" Naruto pointed at him while glaring. He then sighed in defeat, "What do you want?"</p><p>Kyuubi gave him one of the most mischievous looks he had ever seen, it even rivaled his. The next thing Naruto knew was that he was at some restaurant paying for Kyuubi's meal. 'I've never seen someone eat that much tofu in my life.' Naruto just stared on as Kyuubi finished his tenth meal of it.</p><p>"Are finally done?" Naruto looked wide-eyed at the fox in front of him.</p><p>"Hm, I guess." Kyuubi gave him a lazy smirk while sitting back in his chair. "I'll let Shukaku sit with us again."</p><p>"Yosh!" Naruto pumped a fist in the air.</p><p>"Don't forget, you have to pay."</p><p>That fist quickly went down as Naruto got his wallet out and paid the bill. His poor frog wallet was completely empty.</p><p>"Poor froggy, you've become anorexic." Sighing he put the wallet back in his pants as they left the restaurant.</p><p>"You have a frog wallet?" Kyuubi gave him a look of disbelief.</p><p>"Yeah so! Everyone has weird things they have for no reason!" Naruto puffed out his cheeks, ears flattening back.</p><p>Kyuubi gave him an amused smirk, his ears twitching. "Whatever."</p><p>Naruto huffed at the smug fox but continued to walk beside him. They walked on in silence until Kyuubi was the one who broke it again.</p><p>"You can stop fol-" Naruto interrupted his sentence.</p><p>"Let's go to your secret place again!" Naruto grabbed Kyuubi's wrist and tugged him along.</p><p>Kyuubi could have easily have gotten out of the kitsune hanyou's grip, but decided to amuse him. They reached their destination in a few minutes since it wasn't far from where they were. Naruto plopped onto the ground and looked up at Kyuubi smiling as big as he could. Kyuubi thought his face would crack from how big it was. He laughed at his dumb thought.</p><p>But that caught Naruto's attention, "What's so funny?"</p><p>"Oh, nothing… just a thought." Kyuubi sat down and leaned against a tree that was a good distance from Naruto but close enough so they could still hear each other.</p><p>"Oh come on! Tell me! I bought you food!" Naruto inched closer while giving Kyuubi the puppy eyes.</p><p>"You bought me food because of our deal. Also, the puppy eyes don't work on me." Kyuubi turned his nose up on Naruto.</p><p>"Please! I wish to hear your holy thoughts great one." Naruto clasping his hands together while looking to Kyuubi like he was a god. 'Bet this will work!'</p><p>"Hmmm…. No." Kyuubi smirked at the deflated look on Naruto's face.</p><p>Naruto just kept looking to the ground like his world had been crushed from Kyuubi not answering him. It only took a few minutes before Kyuubi finally gave in.</p><p>"Fine!" Kyuubi said exasperatedly then looked to the ground and blushed a little. "I just thought your face would crack from smiling that big."</p><p>Naruto just looked at the fidgeting fox before he started to snicker. "It's not funny!" Kyuubi's face turned even pinker and his ears turned back in frustration.</p><p>"That was a dumb thought!" Naruto laughed even harder from the look Kyuubi was giving him.</p><p>"Urusai brat! I'm leaving!" Kyuubi got up and was about to march off when he got tackled to the ground by the little ball of energy.</p><p>"No! Don't go! I'll stop laughing! I'll stop!" Naruto looked at the kitsune he was sitting, before he could get up their positions were quickly switched.</p><p>Kyuubi looked down at the younger kit, "Stop tackling me to the ground! It does hurt you know."</p><p>Naruto looked up at Kyuubi worried that he'd get hit until he saw the humor in the crimson eyes. It made them look softer and Kyuubi more approachable. He really couldn't help it so he leaned up and pecked Kyuubi on the lips.</p><p>Kyuubi's eyes widened in shock and his face tinged pink again, "Why do you always do that you baka!" But the anger didn't quit reach his eyes, it was a different look that made Naruto shiver.</p><p>Instead of yelling like Naruto thought he would Kyuubi leaned down and kissed him. When their lips connected it felt strange for both of them. It felt, just amazing. Naruto wrapped his arms around Kyuubi's neck and kissed back. The older foxes tongue started to lick at Naruto's bottom lip for entry and Naruto groaned and opened his mouth. To Kyuubi, the younger kit tasted sweet yet salty and a little bit like ramen. But that made Kyuubi sigh in content, he actually liked the taste. Shyly, Naruto started to join in by lightly touching Kyuubi's tongue with his own. This made Kyuubi moan which gave Naruto more confidence in what he was doing.</p><p>They pulled away for air, both panting and blushing. Naruto pulled Kyuubi back down and this time he took more control. Kyuubi tasted spicier then he thought yet with a hint of cinnamon, it suited him. Pulling away, Kyuubi started to trail kisses down Naruto's jaw and neck. He kisses and nipped which made Naruto moan in pleasure. Naruto trailed his hands down Kyuubi's back until he felt soft fur at the base of Kyuubi's nine-tails. He gently rubbed at the base cause Kyuubi to moan/whimper from Naruto's caresses. Kyuubi was about to kiss Naruto again when they heard a ringing going off in Kyuubi's pocket. Kyuubi growled but answered his phone anyway.</p><p>"Hai, what is it?" Kyuubi asked impatiently. "Yuki, I'm bus-y." Kyuubi had to hold back a groan as Naruto thought to nip his neck. "Yeah fine…. Whatever."</p><p>Kyuubi got up and started to walk off, "I have to go home now."</p><p>Naruto clumsily got up and ran over to Kyuubi, "W-wait! Um.. um are we d-d-dating?" Naruto said the last part very quietly while blushing.</p><p>Kyuubi's face turned a crimson red, "Uh, I don't know… are we?"</p><p>"Well… we did make out so I guess we are." Naruto looked up to Kyuubi shyly.</p><p>"Ok…. But don't think I'll be any nicer!" Kyuubi started to walk away, a small smile appearing on his face.</p><p>"Ok!" Naruto said happily and raced off to his own home. 'I can't wait to tell Gaara this!'</p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p>Ta-dah! It is done! I'm thinking about putting a lemon in the next chapter.. should I? It's up to you people! Again.. gomen! I'll try and update Friday too! But if not Friday it will be sometime next week!
