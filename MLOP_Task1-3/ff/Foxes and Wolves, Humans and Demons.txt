sunlight began to warm Kyuubi under the sheets, he stirred awake to
find Naruto practically on top of him. "What the? Naruto?" he
asked. The boy was dead asleep, and his arms hugged Kyuubi tightly.
The man was frightened when he found that Naruto had no shirt on, but
the boy had the sense to put on pants at least.</P><P>"This is a tad extreme," Kyuubi said quietly. After saying that,
Naruto unconsciously wrapped his left knee around Kyuubi's stomach.
Kyuubi blushed deep red. He found Naruto in this state to be very
cute, and sexy as well, but he tried to keep himself from thinking
about the newly dubbed Bijuu that way. Naruto's breathing was deep
and almost mechanical in pattern, meaning that Kyuubi would be stuck
like this for a while to come.</P><P><I>No,</I> he screamed into his mind as images of the boy naked
appeared. <I>Bad brain. Stop it. Oh no,</I> he thought as his body
responded in the way Kyuubi hoped he could prevent. <I>He's too
young and innocent. I can't take him, no matter how much you want
me to. Although, this could be a problem if the villagers don't fix
his room in the next couple of weeks,</I> he thought desperately to
himself.</P><P><I>It would completely destroy his trust in me if I let loose on him
during mating season. For once, I wish I was human.</I> Kyuubi now
had a full-blown erection and a scarlet blush. Naruto gave a
half-loud snore, making Kyuubi giggle. <I>How many things must I find
cute about him?</I> he asked himself in both a profound happiness and
in anger towards his hormones.</P><P>Naruto's eyes began twitching. He was waking up, a catastrophe for
Kyuubi if the boy woke up to feeling his rock-hard member. The
slitted cerulean orbs opened slightly as Naruto yawned. "Hey Kyuu,"
he said with a small smile. Kyuubi looked back at him as calmly as he
could, but beads of sweat were forming at the back of his neck. "Did
you sleep well?" the blond asked quietly. He had yet to discover
Kyuubi's problem, and said man was not going to give him the
chance.</P><P>"I slept fine. You however, are lying on top of me. Could you
please change from this provocative position of yours?" Kyuubi
asked in a kind voice. He gave an awkward half-smile to Naruto,
signaling that, while he knew it was by accident, he was
uncomfortable, even though Kyuubi was actually enjoying it. He wanted
to keep Naruto in the dark for now to keep their friendship intact.
Naruto looked back at his knee and gasped before he rolled off of
Kyuubi to the left.</P><P>"Woah!" Naruto said as he fell off the side of the bed. He landed
painlessly with a thump. Kushina came running faster than one would
think possible and opened his door.</P><P>"Naruto, are you all right?" she asked concernedly. Kyuubi
stealthily and quickly moved a hand under the cover, put his dick
flat against his stomach and underneath the waistband of his pants,
and put his hand back exactly where it was, hoping that no one had
seen. Naruto sprang back up with a smile as he rubbed the back of his
head, something he did every time he got embarrassed. Kushina ran
over to him to check. Kyuubi thought she was an overly protective
psycho-mom. "Are you bleeding? Should we go see Tsunade?" she
asked frantically.</P><P>"I'm perfectly fine mom," Naruto replied. "I was just clumsy.
Besides, now that Madara is dead, there isn't much that can
threaten my body." Kushina breathed a sigh of relief until he
boasted his semi-invincibility.</P><P>"Trust me Mrs. Uzumaki," Kyuubi began. "Naruto couldn't be
hurt by rolling off the bed if it happened a thousand times in a
row." Kushina shot him a dark look; it seemed to be one of
disapproval as well. Kyuubi was actually stunned in fear. This woman
had a talent for using her facial expressions.</P><P>"Kyuubi's right," Naruto said brightly. "Oh shoot, I forgot
my jacket." The boy ran into the bathroom and picked it up from the
floor. "Aw, it's soaking wet and cold."</P><P>"Just put it out on the line Naruto," Kushina told him. "Your
boots are nice and clean too, even though they're illusions."
Naruto followed her instruction, quickly exiting the room and going
down the stairs. Kushina turned to Kyuubi who was still in the bed
with a dark and foreboding look. Kyuubi shrank back a bit in his
mind. <I>What is her problem?</I> he asked himself.</P><P>"You listen here," Kushina began in a terrifyingly quiet and
warning voice. "I know what you did while you thought I was
concentrating on Naruto." Kyuubi's eyes widened in terror.</P><P>"I never meant to. Please don't tell him," he pleaded. Kushina
held up her hand to stop him.</P><P>"I swear. If I ever catch you trying to get closer to my boy than
necessary, I will find a way to kill you. And if I can't pull that
off, I'll have the entire village against you in a heartbeat, and
you'll be run out of here, never to return." An actual tear ran
from Kyuubi's right eye, but Kushina ignored it entirely. "Naruto
has had an impossibly hard life, as I'm sure you know. He doesn't
need to be further discriminated against because he turns gay,
especially with you of all people. While I would still love him all
the same, the rest of the world probably wouldn't. I also am not
risking his feelings being hurt. I know how badly he would take it if
you betrayed him, and I hope you know that too. You know how close he
keeps the ones he cares about, so don't even think about it." Her
expression was one of agony and anger mixed into one. Kyuubi was both
stunned and terrified by her words.</P><P>"Don't you ever try to seduce my son," Kushina ended in pure
hating anger. Naruto's footsteps coming up the stairs could be
easily heard, so she ended the conversation with one final warning
look. Her expression immediately changed as she walked out the door.
"I'll have breakfast ready in about twenty minutes you two. Oh,
and Kyuubi?" she asked in a much kinder tone. His eyes immediately
shot up.</P><P>"Yes?" he asked with a crack in his voice.</P><P>"Wash up, will you? You may use the shower in Naruto's bathroom."
Kyuubi sat there terrified for another thirty seconds before Naruto
came in. He changed his expression as the door opened and wiped his
tear away so as to hide what had just happened.</P><P>"Hey Kyuu," he said cheerily. "I'll start the water for ya.
It takes a minute for it to warm up." Naruto had luckily missed
Kyuubi bringing his arm across his cheek, a fact the redhead was
thankful for. <I>Oh Kami,</I> he thought to himself. <I>What am I
supposed to do if mating season comes around and we aren't in
separate rooms? Now I'll lose Naruto completely if I screw up.
</I>Naruto walked back into the room with a smile as Kyuubi got up.</P><P>"Make sure to take a quick one," Naruto began. "Mom's food is
awesome, and I devour it. If you want some, you'll have to be down
before she finishes."</P><P>"A-alright," Kyuubi said in an off voice. He walked into the
bathroom while trying to avoid looking at Naruto.</P><P>"Something wrong Kyuu?" he asked with concern in his voice. The
boy's expression was one of worry as well.</P><P>"I'm just tired from yesterday is all," he replied flatly as he
closed the door. "I'll see ya in a few minutes." He heard the
boy exit the bedroom and walk down the stairs. Kyuubi then undressed
and stepped into a perfectly warmed shower. "Aaaaah," he sighed.
"This is perfect." As Kyuubi savored the deliciously warm water,
he began thinking about how he could deal with his feelings toward
the wolf-boy.</P><P><I>Maybe I can use my being his mentor to ask him about his own
feelings. I have to teach him about mating season, so that's my
best shot,</I> Kyuubi thought to himself. <I>If he actually feels
that way about me, then Kushina won't beat me into oblivion. It's
probably an empty wish though. He's too young to really develop
that part of his emotional spectrum. By the time he does, he'll
probably already have another potential partner, a female human
probably. What was I thinking? He grew up as a human; they detest
homosexuality. I'm a demon, and we view both sexes as being
beautiful in their own way. Many demons bed both sexes, and many
same-sex mates exist. I might as well just give up on that prospect
though, so why can't I? Damn it to Hell. I'm hopelessly in love
with him. What am I supposed to do? </I>He asked no one in
particular.</P><P>Kyuubi put some of Naruto's shampoo into his hair and wet it before
working it in with his hands. The scent was a heavenly honey-lemon
that was intoxicating to Kyuubi. His problem from before began to
resurrect itself as he drew in the scent. <I>Why must I be cursed so?</I>
<I>Everything about him is so perfect and cute and sexy. Even the
stuff he puts in his own hair enhances his beauty. No! I can't
think like that. Even if it breaks my heart, Naruto's matters more.</I>
Kyuubi scrubbed himself down vigorously with Naruto's lavender body
wash. This wasn't anywhere near as breathtaking as the shampoo, but
Kyuubi began tearing up. His case was impossible. He had to either
break his own heart for the sake of Naruto, or he would have to break
both of their hearts by claiming him only once against his mother's
will.</P><P>Kyuubi was clean as a whistle as he stepped out from the shower. He
wrapped himself in a towel and walked over to the foggy mirror. The
redhead warmed it up with his chakra so that he could see himself.
Red slits stared back at him, but they were filled with anguish and
tears. <I>Even if he wants me as his friend, how could Naruto ever
love me, love a demon as imperfect as me?</I> Kyuubi asked himself in
anger and hopelessness. He dispelled his ninja gear and conjured up a
blue t-shirt, boxers, and black slacks. Kyuubi finished by making
himself some open-toed sandals as well. He never liked shoes, too
cramped.</P><P>Kushina was still working on flipping her homemade blueberry
pancakes. Kyuubi counted four in total. The woman clearly didn't
want to actually feed him anything. When he looked at everything else
though, Kyuubi saw a large amount of scrambled eggs, sausage,
homemade toast, and a hot cereal he wasn't familiar with.</P><P>"Take a seat," Naruto said happily as he drew out a chair for
Kyuubi. "As our honored guest, you should enjoy yourself." Kyuubi
smiled at the boy half-heartedly. He could feel Kushina's
annoyance, and he knew that the boy didn't know a scrap of what had
happened.</P><P>"Thanks Naruto-Kun, Mrs. Uzumaki," Kyuubi replied as he slowly
sat down himself. He noticed that Kushina had stopped flipping for an
extra half second, but she then went back to her pattern. "I can't
thank you enough for giving me a place to stay for a little while."</P><P>"As long as your courteous and don't make a mess of the place,
you're welcome to stay as long as you need Kyuubi," Kushina said
flatly. The redhead's spirit lifted a bit. <I>At least she won't
outright throw me out as long as I play by her rules,</I> he thought
to himself.</P><P>Kushina put the last pancake on the stack before bringing the platter
over. Naruto also carried over three plates. The woman gave Kyuubi a
stern glare, trying to make him remember his current situation.
Kyuubi was on thin ice, no doubt.</P><P>"Thank you Naruto," he said as the blond gave him a plate. "And
thank you for the food as well Mrs. Uzumaki."</P><P>"Just call me Kushina," she said with a grin. Her reluctance
wasn't hidden from Kyuubi. In fact, she purposely made it so that
only he could see her annoyance. The woman sat down before spooning
some hot cereal onto Naruto's plate. He attacked it with vigor at
first, but then he slowed down to actually enjoy his food. She put
some onto Kyuubi's plate as well.</P><P>"Thanks a lot Mrs. err, Kushina-San," Kyuubi said as politely as
he could. There was no response. <I>This is getting on my nerves,</I>
he thought to himself. <I>I'll just have to wear her down is all.
But this will take some time.</I> Kyuubi subconsciously put a
spoonful of the hot cereal into his mouth. It was very grainy, just
like the way it looked, but there was a nuttiness and sweet flavor as
well, which highly appealed to his taste buds. Kyuubi didn't eat as
much as a horse though, so he went more slowly so as to enjoy it. He
was shocked at how much Naruto could ingest without feeling
satisfied.</P><P>"Would you like some eggs Kyuu?" the boy asked brightly. Kushina
turned to Naruto with a surprised and, was that a look of her being
frightened?</P><P>"Kyuu?" she asked humorously as possible so as to hide her fear.</P><P>"That's his nickname courtesy of me," the blond replied with a
smile. Kushina turned to Kyuubi with a questioning look.</P><P>"Yes, thank you Naruto," he replied as he held his plate up.
Naruto was clumsy with the serving fork, but he eventually got a full
portion onto the redhead's plate. "I haven't had this in
years," he said nostalgically. After swallowing a mouthful with a
sigh, Kyuubi noticed Kushina's questioning look. Since Naruto was
in ecstasy with his own food, Kyuubi mouthed the words "my
nickname" to Kushina as he watched for the boy to open his eyes.
Kushina nodded as her look became angrier. Kyuubi couldn't actually
tell her right there, so he projected his chakra into her to transfer
the thought: <I>"I have no idea why he calls me that. He said that
the first time as he bade me goodnight last night." </I>Kyuubi even
showed her exactly how that scene played out the night before,
silencing any of her negative theories.</P><P>Kyuubi swallowed the last of his eggs before reaching to take a
single sausage. Kushina shot him a glare, but Kyuubi merely sighed
before placing it on his plate. He hadn't gotten up, and the
sausages were right next to him. What was the woman's deal? There
was real reason behind her not wanting Kyuubi to "play" with
Naruto, but this was getting ridiculous.</P><P>"These are very delicious," Kyuubi commented as he smiled at the
woman he was beginning to hate. "Way better than the last time I
was able to actually sit at a dinner table. Of course, that was over
seventy years ago." Kyuubi took another bite. The meat was well
seasoned, and the shell on the outside had a nice crunch. He wiped
his chin off with a napkin as some of the juices leaked out.</P><P>"Just how old are you?" Naruto asked humorously. Kyuubi nearly
choked on the sausage he had in his throat, but he got it down. <I>Me
and my big mouth, and yours too Naruto-Kun</I>, Kyuubi thought
depressively.</P><P>"I'm about six-hundred-twenty-seven years old," he replied
quietly with a blush. Kushina took on a look of shock before smiling
slightly. <I>That can't be good,</I> Kyuubi thought to himself.
Naruto was dumbfounded. "Bijuu are actually immortal beings; I'm
just the youngest… now second youngest of the ten," Kyuubi said
as he gave Naruto a smile. "The one closest to my age is Shukaku
actually. He's nearly one millennium old. Just another twenty
sem-odd years before we get to celebrate <I>that</I> milestone, not
that he will actually even mature at all by then. He's such a
psychopathic jackass of a nutcase tanuki."</P><P>Kushina glared at him for using foul language, but then Naruto spoke
up. "Gotta agree with you on that one Kyuu. I remember fighting
him. He's crazy about wanting to kill and junk. Good thing we got
him out of Gaara. Oh hey, would you like a pancake Kyuu?" Both
Kushina's and Kyuubi's eyes shot up at the smiling boy.</P><P>"No, but thank you very much Naruto-Kun. The meal was very
delicious," Kyuubi replied. Kushina smiled now that she knew Kyuubi
knew his place. Naruto however, was confused and determined.</P><P>"Aw, come on," he whined. "You really haven't lived until
you've eaten one of my mom's homemade blueberry pancakes."</P><P>"I really shouldn't," Kyuubi replied. He was desperate to not
step into dangerous territory.</P><P>"Just take one bite." Naruto had already carved a triangle from
his own pancake and held it out to Kyuubi on his fork. Kushina had
her eyes raised dangerously, but Kyuubi couldn't just outright
refuse Naruto. His face was so pleading and cute to the fox-man.</P><P>"If you really insist," he said with resignation in his voice.
Kyuubi reached out and took the fork from Naruto's hand. He looked
Kushina in the eye with desperation. <I>I'm trying okay. Shouldn't
that be enough for you?</I> He asked in his mind. Kyuubi bit down on
the piece to realize that it was incredibly flavorful. A broad smile
appeared on his face as Kyuubi tasted the hot blueberries that were
sliced and crushed with his teeth. He swallowed it all happily and
gave Naruto his fork back.</P><P>"Those are incredible Kushina. You're quite the cook," Kyuubi
said as he sent a genuine smile her way. Kushina was flattered and
returned his smile with a genuine one of her own. "I'm stuffed.
How about you guys?" Kushina put her utensils down on her plate,
signaling that she was done. Naruto was still pigging out though.</P><P>"I'll wash the dishes since you cooked Kushina-San. Thanks again
for the meal," Kyuubi said politely. He picked up Kushina's plate
and brought it over to the sink. Kushina also brought over the
platter that was holding the scrambled eggs from before.</P><P>"You're quite welcome Kyuubi," the woman said genuinely. "And
thank you for helping with the dishes." Kyuubi scrubbed down the
plates with the washcloth that was held by the faucet. As strong as
he was, the entire job was done in just two minutes. Kushina examined
his work. "Nicely done," she complimented him. The platter was
spotless as well.</P><P>After placing the platter back in its cabinet, Kushina said "Naruto?"
The boy's head shot up with half a sausage hanging from his lips.
Kyuubi thought it was kinda cute. "First of all, don't put so
much in your mouth; you'll choke. Second, could you please wash the
rest of the dishes when you are done?" The blond nodded with a
smile as he broke the sausage in half and put the one part down on
his plate. "I'm just gonna go have a talk with Kyuubi for a sec."
Naruto gave a thumbs-up sign showing that he had heard. Kushina
lightly tugged Kyuubi's shirt so that he would follow her.</P><P>The two went outside. The weather was still too cold for summer, but
at least it wasn't snowing. "Thank you for showing that you can
restrain yourself Kyuubi," Kushina said with a sigh. "I know that
was kind of unfair but,"</P><P>"Just drop it," Kyuubi replied flatly. "Naruto wouldn't be
interested in me that way, so you don't need to worry. He's also
far stronger than me, so he could stop me if I tried anything against
his will. It's pointless for me to try unless he actually feels the
same way I do, so you don't have to worry." Kushina looked a bit
concerned. She felt bad that she had hurt the redhead's feelings.
"As long as his other room is rebuilt within the next two weeks,
there won't be a problem."</P><P>Kushina was very concerned by the way he had said that last part.
"What do you mean?" she asked darkly. The man gave no response.
"Kyuubi, what aren't you telling me?" The redhead paused for a
second and sighed before continuing.</P><P>"Precisely two weeks from now, on the summer solstice…the Demon
Mating Season begins," Kyuubi said. Kushina was shocked.
"Unfortunately, it lasts for three weeks."</P><P>"The Bijuu actually have a mating season?" Kushina asked. Kyuubi
nodded. "I realize what the implications are, but what exactly is
going to happen?"</P><P>"I'm only telling you this because I can trust you," Kyuubi
began. He breathed deeply and released before continuing. "Bijuu,
and demons in general, find both sexes to be beautiful in their
respective manners. It is actually normal for demons to bed both
males and females. And many same-sex mate couples exist. To us,
homosexuality is non-existent because we do not make that prejudice."
Kushina was awestruck by what the redhead was saying.</P><P>"I have only ever fallen in love twice," Kyuubi began. "The
first time was with Nibi no Nekomata, the Two-Tailed Ghost Cat. You
saw how she teased me in that cave? It was to make me remember how
she denied my love and advances. We do not seduce; we attempt to gain
affection before anything physical, but that drive exists as well.
Sex, while not being the primary motive, is a factor in solidifying a
relationship. This is what we refer to as mating. Humans refer to it
as consummation."</P><P>"Demons are truly a fascinating lot," Kushina said with her head
down. Her voice reflected her worries on where the conversation was
heading. "I'm guessing you don't actually hold a marriage
ceremony."</P><P>"No, but when a demon truly takes a mate, not just a lover or bed
partner, a true mate, both members of the couple are to permanently
abstain themselves from having affairs with others. Our definition of
mates is similar to yours, if not the exact same. Mates are supposed
to hold each other in the highest esteem. Violating this law means
death in our society."</P><P>"Everything that humans have ever said about demons being seducers
is wrong?" Kushina asked in wonder.</P><P>"Unfortunately," Kyuubi began. "That is not quite true either.
Humans find demons in human, and sometimes demon form to be
captivating and attractive. In most cases, it is the human who seeks
the relationship with the demon. This is a case of bed partners. But
the sad ending is that the human cannot sate him or herself with
another human, and they become literally addicted to the demon's
touch. If we seduce, it is by accident. The one key difference
between mere lovers and mates is that mates make the conscious
decision to be bound together forever. Lovers, while they may have
extreme attachment to each other, either are not ready for the
commitment, or they are unsure of their possibility for success.
Mates can never be truly separated or be released from the bond of
being mates."</P><P>"That's difficult to wrap one's mind around," Kushina
commented as she sat on a stone step. "I must apologize to you for
what I said and did to you earlier. I was rash and overprotective."</P><P>"You were trying to make up for all the time you could not spend as
his mother before; I understand," the redhead replied with a sigh.</P><P>"You said that you had only fallen in love twice," Kushina began
hesitantly. "Who was the second one?"</P><P>There was a pause before Kyuubi answered her. "I… think I am
truly falling in love with your son." Kushina closed her eyes and
bowed her head as her suspicions were confirmed. "That is why I
began telling you about Bijuu mating season. Demons, at any point
beyond a certain age, can produce offspring. Naruto is at that
threshold. Unlike humans however, we are not only <I>allowed</I>, but
we <I>must</I> make the conscious decision to want to bear a child,
and even then there is a good chance that one will not be born.
Luckily, simple procreation cannot accidentally give birth to a child
as can happen in human society. It is a very special event when a
demon gives birth because of the rarity of the event."</P><P>"What does that have to do with the two of you though?" Kushina
asked dumbfounded. "Two males can't produce children with one
another…can they?"</P><P>"In demon society, two males can produce offspring together if they
so choose," Kyuubi replied. Kushina put a hand over her mouth as
her expression went to one of shock. "But as I said, a conscious
decision must be made."</P><P>"Then what is there to really worry about, except for you and
Naruto… you know?" Kushina asked with a heavy voice.</P><P>"During mating season, we Bijuu are at the height of our fertility
and desire for procreation," Kyuubi said darkly. Kushina's eyes
widened further. "While the creation of a child is actually usually
the furthest thing from the minds of demons in heat, there is a
chance that one pair might be thinking rationally enough to make that
decision before both partners become exhausted with their
activities."</P><P>"I'm going to admit this to you out of trust, so don't go
blathering away," Kyuubi warned. Kushina nodded. "As I said, I
only ever fell in love with Nibi…so, how do I put this? I have
stayed a virgin, because I wanted my first time to be with one I
truly cared about." Kushina blushed and tried to hide her smile. It
was an interesting and beautiful concept. "Make no mistake though;
I have relieved myself during mating seasons in the past through
self-pleasure. In reality, I'm about as inexperienced with sex as
your son is."</P><P>"But still," Kushina interrupted. "You said yourself that
Naruto wouldn't be interested in a relationship like that with you.
What more could there possibly be?"</P><P>"This is the most important thing to remember about Demon Mating
Season," Kyuubi began. "We are more desirous than at any other
point in the year, meaning that sometimes we have sex out of pure
instinct and desire to relieve ourselves of the tension. Basically,
I'm saying that Naruto's judgment and mine will be impared during
this three-week period."</P><P>"So that's why you were after a separate room," Kushina
guessed. Kyuubi nodded. "I almost hate to ask, but if you truly
love him, then why are you trying to stay separated?"</P><P>"I had two main reasons. One was your threats. The second, more
important one is this: Naruto is far younger than me, and he's
still innocent in that respect. Since he just became a Bijuu, that
would be too much change too quickly. But even more importantly, he
might be traumatized by the experience and scarred for life. I want
to protect him from both me and himself."</P><P>"You really do love him, don't you?" Kushina asked as she
walked over to him. A single tear worked its way down his cheek.</P><P>"More than you could ever know," Kyuubi replied as he sniffled
and wiped the tear away. "And what's worse, the boy is naïve
Kushina. You must acknowledge that." Kushina was curious as to what
he meant. "What would happen if he suddenly wanted to become my
mate because he was over-intoxicated by his own hormones and I denied
him? That would destroy all of his feelings for me, and we would
drift apart as friends. An even worse scenario would be that I
accepted his wish to be mates and then found later that he wasn't
ready for such a decision and that there was no way back or out. He'd
lose his free-spiritedness."</P><P>Kushina was completely stunned at what Kyuubi was saying. What had
happened that morning was not only an accident; it was something that
Kyuubi tried to hide from Naruto to keep him safe as well. Kushina
hugged Kyuubi lovingly, an awkward experience for the demon. "You'd
make a wonderful mate Kyuubi," she said, bringing him to tears.
"You've proven to me that you truly love him, so I will respect
your wishes. You may stay here for as long as you wish. If you wish
to be with Naruto, and he with you, I will not stop you."</P><P>"I just wonder if he will ever actually love <I>me</I>," Kyuubi
said. "He's got Sakura and Hinata both swooning over him. Even
though they will die, and Naruto will live on, he might not ever wish
to take another so as to be a devoted husband to whoever he chooses.
I shouldn't have a say in who he chooses, but I hope I have a shot
at least."</P><P>Kushina held the redhead tightly as she patted his hair. "He'll
choose you," she said. "If he really is my and Minato's son, he
will choose you." Kyuubi smiled lightly at the woman's words.</P><P>"Thank you Kushina," he said as he hugged her back. "I am sorry
for what happened to your husband, but now you can look at your son
in joy as he exceeds all expectations."</P><P>"I will remember those words always Kyuubi." The two finally
walked back into the house to find Naruto finished with the dishes.</P><P>"What could you possibly be talking about that would take fifteen
whole minutes?" Naruto asked as soon as he saw them. "I had half
a mind to eavesdrop."</P><P>"Quit complaining," Kyuubi replied with a smile. "Besides, you
and I have a job to do today." Kushina and Naruto both turned to
him.</P><P>"What do you mean?" they both asked at the same time, making them
turn to each other.</P><P>"Perhaps you remember what Kakashi told you?" Kyuubi asked.
Naruto stood there with a thinking face on for about four seconds
before his expression changed to one of surprise.</P><P>"Oh, the Hokage Mansion and the Monument," he said loudly. Kyuubi
nodded. "How bad is it?"</P><P>"We know that all of the Hokage faces are gone, but past that I
don't know," Kyuubi said. "Let's go Naruto; you're dressed.
Kushina, I'm taking him to see Tsunade if we can find her. I'll
see what we can do to help clear up this mess. We'll be back by
sundown unless Tsunade really holds us up."</P><P>"See you two then," Kushina called as Kyuubi dragged a reluctant
Naruto out the door. "Naruto, you're as bratty as Minato was when
he was a kid. Kyuubi's making a good influence on him though."
Naruto was up and over the hill, leaving Kushina alone for at least
an hour.</P><P>"Aw Kyuu, this is gonna be a pain," the blond complained as he
walked alongside the man. "Every time I get put to work, it lasts
for hours, even when I'm getting help from shadow clones."</P><P>"Except," Kyuubi began, "you're now stronger, faster, and you
have a nearly limitless chakra reserve. Face it Naruto; you don't
have an excuse." He simply groaned at the redhead's words. Kyuubi
looked back at him, taking in the look of his cerulean slitted eyes.
He found the boy's face to be completely irresistible, but Kyuubi
had to train himself to exercise control if his plan to stay celibate
during mating season was going to succeed.</P><P><I>This is gonna require a lot of extra masturbation sessions than
normal,</I> he thought grimly to himself. "Oh jeez," Kyuubi said
as the village came into view. Naruto stopped next to him in shock.
"It's a freaking wreck," they both said in disbelief. "The
Hokage Mansion… it's gone!" Kyuubi pointed to where it used to
be. Naruto's expression turned to one of fear and self-blame.</P><P>"We have work to do," Kyuubi said, snapping the boy out of it.
They ran down to the screwed up marketplace. "Hey, at least
Ichiraku's survived," Kyuubi said happily. Naruto was overjoyed
and went to talk with the owner. After he was inside, Kyuubi was
approached by Tsunade.</P><P>"He in there?" she asked. Kyuubi nodded. "This place is more
wrecked than when Orochimaru took a spin at it. Even my house is gone
because of that technique."</P><P>"Just be glad that Madara is gone at last and that Akatsuki will no
longer be a threat to the world," Kyuubi replied flatly. "I
brought Naruto here so that we could help with rebuilding. You should
be thankful that he is miraculously alive. Anyway, is there anything
we can do to help?"</P><P>"I am grateful that he isn't actually dead. The entire village
would be mourning for him. And Kushina would be useless in that state
of mind," Tsunade retorted. "As per what you guys can do to help,
we need the dead bodies dragged out before they become diseased and
rot." The woman shivered, confusing Kyuubi. He looked up to see
that the sky was still grey.</P><P>"Why in the world would it be like this in the middle of summer?"
he asked in utter confusion. "I realize why it would have done this
yesterday, even to the point where it snowed, but this is
ridiculous."</P><P>"I will get a research team to investigate, but I agree; this is
strange," Tsunade told him. "Hello Naruto," she called. "Help
Kyuubi drag the dead bodies of the enemy out of here, but leave our
allies where they are so we can hold a large funeral for them all and
send messages to their families."</P><P>"Aw," Naruto whined. Tsunade gave him a hard look. "Fine; where
do you want them?"</P><P>"Just toss them outside the gate and into the woods," Tsunade
commanded. Naruto summoned a hundred clones, surprising the woman.</P><P>"Kyuubi, let's see who can gather the most," the boy suggested.
Kyuubi summoned a hundred of his own clones.</P><P>"You're on," he replied. They all sped off in blurs, scaring
several working ninja along the way. It took them a whole hour to
gather up all the dead enemy bodies, but the village was purged.</P><P>"You lose Kyuubi," Naruto yelled from atop what could only be
described as his mountain. Kyuubi's gathering was easily dwarfed,
but his efforts were apparent as well.</P><P>"Don't let it go to your head," Kyuubi warned with a smile. "I
still know thousands of jutsu that you do not. You might be able to
beat me in brute strength, but I've got you beat when it comes to
brains."</P><P>"Nicely done you two," Tsunade yelled up. Both Kyuubi and Naruto
jumped down and landed on their feet. "Now we just have to find a
way to dispose of this many." Naruto rolled his eyes as he
compressed fire chakra into his hand. A swirling fireball sat in his
hand as he smirked at Tsunade. She was worried about it turning into
an uncontrollable inferno, but had Naruto chucked the globe at the
mound of bodies before she could open her mouth.</P><P>"Well, that's one way to do it," Tsunade commented as white and
yellow flames stretched into the sky. "But we'll have a problem
if any of the trees or buildings catch fire Naruto." Once again,
the boy rolled his eyes as he formulated a plan.</P><P>"You could create an ice shell around the fire so that it isn't
carried on the wind," Kyuubi suggested. Naruto smiled.</P><P>"As you wish," he said with a smile. Naruto began gathering ice
chakra in his mouth. After gathering enough, he jumped above the fire
and opened his maw, literally breathing ice into a curled wall that
surrounded the giant funeral pyre. He dropped back down with a
satisfied look on his face as he panted fog.</P><P>"V-v-v-very n-n-nice N-N-Naruto-K-Kun," Tsunade said shivering.
Everything near where Naruto had put that wall was quickly frosted
over, Tsunade included. Even Kyuubi wasn't immune to the cold, so
he had to fight the urge to shiver. His teeth didn't chatter
though. Naruto grimaced and looked around.</P><P>"Aw man," he whined again. "Let me warm you up a bit."
Tsunade took on a look of terror. If Naruto's ice was this cold,
how hot could his fire be? "I won't do anything like a fireball,
but just put your hands over mine." Tsunade did as he asked and
immediately felt the warmth of a hot shower spread through her.
"Better?" he asked. She nodded to the boy before speaking.</P><P>"You need to be careful with how you use that Ice-Chakra of yours,"
she said. "I have a theory as to why the sky is still grey, and it
might have to do with your transformation, but we'll have to see.
Naruto, your fire went out." Naruto turned to see that his fire and
some of his ice had become a pool of water.</P><P>"That does it," he said in complete annoyance. "I'm just
gonna chuck 'em into the freaking forest; let the wolves deal with
them." Naruto summoned ten clones and started hurling the not
burned corpses as far into the woods as he could, reabsorbing his Ice
and Water-Chakra as he went. Naruto was panting by the time he was
done, but he was far from tired. "I hate working," he said
bluntly. Naruto regained his composure before walking back to Tsunade
and Kyuubi, dispelling his clones on the way there.</P><P>"Have you noticed Naruto?" Kyuubi asked. Naruto wondered what the
heck he meant. "It's snowing." Naruto looked up in shock to see
a gentle yet steady snowfall coming from the sky. "I personally
don't mind snow, but this is just weird for summer."</P><P>"As I said," Tsunade began, "you need to watch how you use that
Ice-Chakra Naruto; it's really powerful, especially in your case."
Naruto continued to look up into the clouds.</P><P>"Something's not right about this," he said. "Kikánugan."
Naruto's expression changed to one of surprise as the source came
into sight. "It's me," he said in wonder.</P><P>"That's what I said Naruto," Tsunade blurted out in annoyance.</P><P>"Not they way you're thinking though. While yes, it was my jutsu
from yesterday that formed the grey clouds originally, these are
staying directly above the Leaf Village. What's worse…." Naruto
gulped. Tsunade and Kyuubi were both curious. "They're caused by
my chakra." Kyuubi was about to speak, but Naruto held his hand up
for him to stop. "It's my chakra flowing out of me; my extra
chakra is flowing up and into the sky, and it's causing the
temperature change and clouds to form. Just me being here, is causing
the snow to fall."</P><P>Tsunade and Kyuubi were both shocked by this information. This was
about the biggest complication possible, and boy talk about timing.
"This is bad," Tsunade said as she held her head in one hand.
"Let's try something creative though Naruto. I want to you toss
really explosive fireballs into the clouds to get rid of them for
now. I've got a ton of other stuff to deal with, so finding a
permanent solution may take some time."</P><P>"More freaking work," Naruto sighed.</P><P>"Would you stop complaining?!" Kyuubi asked him a bit angrily.
"You're alive, immortal in fact. A bit of work won't ruin your
existence. You also have to think of the others around you before
your own wants." Naruto took on a look of hurt before he faded in
dust from the sights of Tsunade and Kyuubi. "Oh crap. What did I
say to offend him?" A loud crackling sound filled the air as a
yellowish light coated the ground and trees. Kyuubi and Tsunade
swiftly turned to see an enormous ball of fire in place of where the
clouds were a few seconds before.</P><P>"He'll incinerate the village!" Tsunade yelled. As the pressure
and heat from the fire dispersed the snowy clouds, Naruto simply let
go of the technique, letting the sphere send plumes of flame high
into the atmosphere. Everything became very bright until the flames
flickered out in midair. The sun now shone high in the sky, and the
temperature was returning to normal. "Go talk to Naruto Kyuubi; I
have some things that I must attend to. Tell Kushina-San I said hello
as well." The redhead nodded before blurring from her sight</P><P>Kyuubi had to use his best tracking abilities to follow Naruto's
trail. The boy really could cover his tracks, but Kyuubi had one
thing on his side, and that was the ability to see Naruto's chakra.
He was outside the village in a crater caused by the use of one
technique or another. Without warning, Naruto's chakra aura
disappeared entirely, surprising and frightening Kyuubi.</P><P>Naruto had taken a few chakra-suppression tags from ANBU in the past.
He now donned them as he sat quietly on the edge of the icy lake. <I>Why
am I so rude today?</I> he asked himself. <I>And why did Kyuubi's
words hurt so much and cut so deep? </I>Naruto stood up unconsciously
and began walking out onto the lake. There was a small iceberg
floating in the middle, where Naruto sat down. <I>Why the heck am I
so mad?</I></P><P>Naruto placed his hands lightly into the cool waters. Without
warning, Naruto began hearing a weird tone in the air. It was steady
and irritating. After shifting his arms to get up, the pitch suddenly
changed to an even higher one. "Stop playing that awful noise!"
he yelled. He didn't sense anyone in the area, so he was confused.
"Is that me?" Naruto lifted his hands completely out of the
water, and the sound stopped.</P><P>"The Hell?" Naruto exclaimed. The water droplets froze on his
hands. They broke off as Naruto flexed his fingers. "Let's see
how good of a musician I am," he joked. Naruto spread his fingers
wide and allowed only the tips of his claws to touch the water. He
was unsure of how exactly he was doing this, but a low humming could
be heard throughout the forest. The boy began experimenting with
different depths and changing his chakra flow. While the suppression
tags held his aura down, he could still control his chakra very
skillfully. Naruto began recreating the sounds of various instruments
he heard and stopped once he mimicked a harp.</P><P><B>Note: If you want to hear a basic idea, go to the site on my
profile labeled "Naruto lullaby." I really have no way to show
you my sheet music because my parents still live in the 20</B><B>th</B><B>
century, no scanners. I personally wrote my own lullaby, and this is
very close, but not anywhere near as complex. Someone actually told
me it sounded like what is played on the YouTube video that the url
in my profile leads to. I wrote both lyrics and parts for both a
viola and a cello, but this is an ok sub.</B></P><P>Naruto began to tear up as he instinctively moved between notes. His
body moved on its own, creating wonderful tones and chords. Kyuubi
had snuck behind a tree to see what had happened to Naruto and was
stunned by these incredible sounds the blond was producing. Naruto
stopped completely, making Kyuubi wonder if he had been discovered.
He stopped his chakra from flowing completely so that he could stay
and listen. Naruto flicked the ice droplets from his hands before
beginning a song that he remembered from when Kushina had sung him
asleep the night he was coming back from the Hidden Cloud Village. It
was a lullaby which melted away all of Naruto's feelings of sadness
and anger, allowing him to vent.</P><P>Each note rang out perfectly as Naruto's claws glided across and
tapped the water, bringing forth immense amounts of emotion. The lake
lit up brilliantly as Naruto's chakra surged through it, nearly
blocking the boy from sight.</P><P>Both he and Kyuubi had been moved to tears by this song, so Naruto
stopped when his vision became too clouded. A tear fell into the
still water, freezing it into a deep blue, marble-like crystal.
Naruto drew his hands out with any resistance at all and stood up.
Kyuubi, while still completely suppressing his chakra, stepped out
from his hiding place and revealed himself to Naruto.</P><P>"Naruto," he said quietly. "That was amazing. No one's ever
been able to create music like that; it was truly stunning." Naruto
turned up to look at him. More tears streamed from his passive eyes.
He was albeit expressionless, but it tore at Kyuubi's heart. "What
happened back there?" Naruto's expression swiftly changed to one
of surprise before converting to be a depressed one.</P><P>"I just want to be alone right now," Naruto replied as an
enormous dome of ice formed around the lake. Kyuubi tried to get in,
but his efforts were fruitless. His punches merely bounced off the
smooth surface.</P><P>"Damn," he spat. "I hope you cool off soon Naruto, or Kushina
will have my hide." He could see Naruto inside placing his claws on
the now solid ice lake. Kyuubi's ears were keen enough to pick up
the tones coming from inside, but jeez ice was good at blocking
sound. Naruto was playing another beautiful piece, making Kyuubi want
to stay and listen, but the boy wished to be alone. "He'll be
fine," the redhead stated as he walked off.</P><P>More snow clouds began to gather. This really was going to become a
problem if Naruto could change the seasons with only his presence.
Kyuubi was concerned. Very soon, he'd have to begin teaching the
boy about Bijuu. And for that, he at the very least needed a way to
talk peacefully. "What a fine kettle of fish," Kyuubi blurted as
he came off the path and back into the village. Apparently, the way
he had just taken wasn't actually a road. Something had busted
apart this particular section of wall with a powerful technique that
continued forward until it made that crater. "Just what in Hell
were we up against?"</P><P>"Pein's summoning," Kushina provided as she revealed her
presence. "It used a high density chakra beam to attack one group
of our ninja. It broke out this entire section of wall and caused an
explosion in the forest. Passed that, we don't know what all
happened here." Kushina paused before asking, "Kyuubi, where is
Naruto? I thought he was with you."</P><P>"There is nothing I can say or do to get through to him right now.
He needs to vent his anger and frustration," the redhead replied.
"He'll be back out as soon as he's hungry; don't worry."</P><P>"What would he be frustrated about?" Kushina stammered. "What
all happened in the last hour and a half?"</P><P>"Work," Kyuubi replied bluntly. "And possibly an emotional
breakdown that doesn't seem to have a cause." Kushina scowled.
"Hey, Tsunade witnessed the whole thing; don't blame me."
Kyuubi went walking into the town to do who knows what, leaving
Kushina to think.</P><P>"What on Earth is going on Naruto?" Kushina asked into the air.
"Akatsuki is dead, Madara is gone, and world peace is being
established. Why are you acting like this? You weren't like
yourself during breakfast. The appetite was there, but something was
off. If only I could read your mind."</P><P>Everyone in the village gathered the corpses of the fallen allies for
examination by Tsunade and Shizune. It took half the day to process
all the information, but Tsunade sighed with relief when she finished
identifying the final dead Sand Ninja. "I wonder how on earth we
will be able to bury so many," she sighed. Shizune had found the
exact number of casualties: two-thousand-seven-hundred-forty-eight
ninja from the various allying lands perished in the two day long
battle. Tsunade laughed half-heartedly before prospecting "I wonder
if Naruto would be willing to lend a hand." Right after saying that
however, Tsunade realized that she had not seen Naruto since he
stormed off.</P><P>"Kyuubi?" she called. The redhead was in front of her in a split
second, frightening her at first. "Try to avoid scaring me. Anyway,
have you seen Naruto since earlier?" Kyuubi dropped his head before
answering.</P><P>"He's still venting as far as I know. That giant ice dome is
still above that one crater, so I assume he is in there," Kyuubi
said as he pointed it out. "He's been playing music in there
since I left him."</P><P>"Since when is he a musician?" Tsunade asked curiously.</P><P>"It's like nothing you have ever experienced in your life. But he
has a natural talent for it. Naruto's amazing when it comes to his
abilities with water," Kyuubi commented with a smile. "I am
concerned though; he hasn't come out for a meal, and those snow
clouds are getting thicker above the dome. Will he die of starvation,
I wonder."</P><P>"I give him ten more minutes," Tsunade said as she stamped the
last paper triumphantly. Without warning, wolves began howling in the
distance, just loud enough for everyone in the village to hear and
pause. This howl was one of a hunting party, but something was off.
As everyone began looking toward the source of the noise, the giant
ice dome came into view. Multiple packs howled at once as the dome
split open and fell. Everyone was stunned by what happened next. A
beautiful aurora shone brightly in the sky as a song took its place
in the air. Naruto was no longer mimicking a harp; he was playing
various instruments, including what seemed to be voices.</P><P><B>Note: I tried a hundred other songs to fit with a dark night and
beautiful light display, but only one fit. I couldn't use a
Christmas one for obvious reasons, so don't complain. If you own
Final Fantasy X, you will certainly know the Hymn of the Fayth.
YouTube has recordings of this. Use a male-voiced one because
otherwise the mood is screwed up. Just do yourselves a favor and
follow the author's advice. I'd recommend looking up </B><U><B>Hymn
of the Fayth All Versions.</B></U><B>
Once here, skip to 4:11, and continue on through Yunalesca. IGNORE
THE GODDAMN PICTURE PERVS!</B>
<B>I chose this one because it involves
multiple voice parts, making the song more emotional and complex</B></P><P>"Is that… Naruto?" Kushina asked. Kyuubi
just stood there with a shocked look on his face. "That's
amazing. I… feel like crying. Everything feels so sorrowful." She
noticed a tear falling from Kyuubi's eye. "Kyuubi, even you…"
He wiped the tear away before looking back up in terror.</P><P>"This song… is one of the eight original songs in existence,"
he said with a shaky voice. Kushina, Tsunade, Jiraiya, and Kakashi
all turned to him. Some of Naruto's friends were interested as
well. "For him to know this song, whether by instinct or by him
figuring it out, is potentially dangerous. He is venting his
emotions, so this situation is potentially risky, although I have yet
to see any of the signs of danger."</P><P>"You don't mean that… he could do something like 'that'
here?" Tsunade asked Kyuubi as she began tearing up.</P><P>"I don't think he knows the full power of this melody, so no,"
Kyuubi replied. "But I need to explain the original songs to you
first. The one you are hearing now is the Nocturne of Sorrows. When
we demons hold a funeral for dearly loved ones, this is always one of
the songs that is played, because it brings forth all of the sorrows
of the people at once, causing both a hysterical mourning session and
allowing the mourners to move on. In a way, this song is used to
bring happiness, but Naruto is using it to vent his own feelings of
anger and loneliness."</P><P>"What will happen then?" Sakura asked.</P><P>"This song holds a power more ancient than the demons, so I cannot
possibly tell you everything about it. What I do know is, that when
this song is played, every ounce of one's sorrow spills forth. Can
you even begin to imagine how much he has stored within himself? More
pain and anguish exist in him than a lifelong prisoner. It could
either take hours for him to vent completely, or he will "explode"
with sorrow all at once. I have no idea what the latter would do
exactly."</P><P>"We can't let him keep playing then," Kushina stated seriously.
Kyuubi held up a hand to stop her.</P><P>"It isn't that simple. A song like this <I>must </I>be completed;
divine powers keep someone from stopping in the middle of it. But the
problem would be if Naruto's emotions boiled over too soon. His
body would still force itself to finish while he wept and thrashed in
agony. There is only one verse left however, so we should get to him
before he begins again."</P><P>Everyone nodded. "Let's go," Tsunade commanded. Kyuubi took one
final stare at the aurora before following her and the group. When
they all came to the edge of the lake, everyone finally figured out
how Naruto was creating his music. Strands of ice stretched from the
surface of the lake. As Naruto's chakra flowed through the lake
itself, deep chords resounded throughout the forest. The strands
themselves seemed to be what were creating the voices. They were so
thin that a single touch could break them. All of it combined with
the changing light patterns in the sky was an overwhelmingly stunning
sight.</P><P>"He is finishing the final line," Kyuubi said flatly as he wiped
away another tear. Everyone was clearing his or her eyes, but Naruto
simply sat still with his fingers dancing on the ice. No tears flowed
from his eyes, something that terrified Kyuubi to the core of his
being. "Get out of here, now," he said. The entire group was
frightened by his words, but they remained steadfast. "Tsunade,
he's going to go berserk at this rate; get them to safety."
Tsunade's expression changed to one of terror as the final notes to
the nocturne played.</P><P>"Run!" she yelled. Everyone took a single look at Naruto to
discover that the aurora was no longer shining various beautiful
colors. Each ribbon of light turned blood-red in an instant, making
each of them run except Kyuubi. "You won't live if you stay here.
Hurry up and get out of the forest."</P><P>As the ribbons of light turned deep red, one last howl of a wolf
could be heard. "Naruto," Kyuubi said quietly. The boy in
question rose in the middle of the lake. When he turned toward
Kyuubi, the fox's heart skipped a beat. "No." The blonde's
normally cerulean eyes had turned crimson red like when Kyuubi
possessed him. Kyuubi saw it coming and dodged as Naruto closed the
distance between them and wound up for a punch.</P><P>"Wake up Naruto!" the redhead yelled. The boy simply turned back
around and sent a volley of punches and kicks at him. One kick was
dead on and hit him in the gut, launching Kyuubi into the forest and
making him double over. "Curse his life," Kyuubi grunted as he
wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth. Naruto then appeared in
front of him. "Oh shit!"</P><P>Whoosh. Naruto's fist barely missed Kyuubi's face. "Please wake
up Naruto," Kyuubi yelled as he gripped Naruto's arm. The boy
wasn't even conscious. He drowned himself in anger and sorrow,
allowing base instinct to run free with him. "Just listen to me,"
Kyuubi said as Naruto jumped back.</P><P>"Convergence," Naruto said before opening his mouth wide. Kyuubi
looked at him in terror, realizing the power behind this technique. A
high density beam of red light shot at his shoulder, missing by a
hairsbreadth.</P><P><I>I can't let him use attacks like that,</I> Kyuubi thought to
himself as he looked behind him to see a perfect hole in an
ice-coated tree. A great flash of red went off as the beam hit the
ground, causing a nova-like explosion. Waves of energy tore the
forest from its roots as they spread out. Tsunade, Kushina, and many
skilled ANBU erected a superior barrier to defend the village at the
break in the wall, and it stood up to trees easily, but the actual
energy seemed to pass right through it and into the villagers.
Everyone began developing feelings of anger and sorrow that only
increased as the final waves of red energy passed into them. All of
the villagers, including Tsunade and her platoon collapsed.</P><P>" Naruto!" Kyuubi yelled as he came running, "calm down. This
isn't like you. Wake up Naruto!" Kyuubi took a strong hit to the
gut, lifting him off his feet as he coughed up blood. The redhead
gripped Naruto's arm tightly so as to not be sent flying. "Wake
up… damn it!" Kyuubi yelled before gripping Naruto's neck.</P><P>"Please let this work!" he yelled before forcing an immense
amount of his own chakra into the boy. Naruto's eyes widened as the
pupils thinned. His eyes began turning back to their original blue
color as the red aurora climbed down from the sky and flew into his
forehead. Kyuubi was in wonder when the light began etching a glowing
snowflake into the boy's forehead. Kyuubi released his grip on the
boy's arm and steadied himself. As the changing snowflake was
finished, Naruto fainted and fell forward. "Naruto!" Kyuubi said
seriously as he caught the blond in his arm. One icy tear fell from
the boy's eye before losing consciousness completely.</P><P>Kyuubi walked back toward the village holding Naruto in his arms. He
was shocked when he saw how unharmed the villagers were. Kushina and
Tsunade ran up to him when they saw the boy in his arms. Blood ran
down his cheek from where the red light had scratched the fluorescent
snowflake into his skin.</P><P>"Is Naruto alright?" Kushina asked as she neared Kyuubi. Both she
and Tsunade were shocked by his new mark.</P><P>"He'll live, but that was far too dangerous. Another Convergence
attack and we'd have been obliterated," Kyuubi replied, his
breathing heavy. "It's a miracle that I was able to stop him. I'm
taking him back to the mansion; it's getting late." After taking
several shaky steps forward, Kyuubi himself fainted, dropping Naruto
as he fell into the dirt with a thud.</P><P>"Kyuubi!" Tsunade screamed. She ran over to him, but was stopped
as the symbol on Naruto's forehead began to glow. Multi-colored
chakra flowed out from Naruto and into Kyuubi, restoring his
consciousness. As he stood up, Kyuubi studied the multi-colored
chakra closely.</P><P>"Every spec is specialized to a particular element," he said.
Kyuubi waved his hand through it slowly, trying futilely to separate
the individual elements. "Amazing. It's so powerful too, and
these healing abilities, remarkable." The aura finally receded, and
Kyuubi picked Naruto up. "Let's try this again, shall we?"
Kushina bade everyone goodnight as she followed the redhead home.</P><P><B>Comments, concerns? I wish to hear them all, seriously. I'm
still not getting reviews! Why are my readers so lazy?</B></P>

Immediately upon gaining consciousness, he looked over at Naruto. The boy was sleeping soundly, but dried streaks of blood ran from his forehead onto his cheeks and into his hair from where a glowing snowflake was carved into his forehead. Kyuubi didn't like Naruto's beauty being defiled so, so he went and got a warm washcloth.</p><p>"You and your adventures little one," he said. Kushina walked in to see Kyuubi wiping away the crusted blood from Naruto's cheeks. "Don't ever scare me like that again Naruto-Kun." Kyuubi was quiet and caring, making Kushina smile as she thought of how parental he could be.</p><p>After Kyuubi finished with the boy's face and hair, he began washing the area around the mark. When he brushed up against it, Kyuubi heard Naruto moan, and a fear unlike any he had felt before worked its way into the core of his being. Visions of the boy getting beaten, abused, and just being alone ran through his mind. Kyuubi fell backwards onto the floor, terrifying Kushina who opened the door and quickly went to his side.</p><p>Kyuubi clutched at his own heart, his breathing shaky and shallow and his eyes in a look of shock and terror. A cold sweat gripped him as the visions faded; Kyuubi began tearing up as he came back to reality.</p><p>"Kyuubi, are you alright?" Kushina asked with worry in her eyes. The redhead was completely silent as he breathed shakily. His entire body was shaking with dread and pain. Kyuubi just shook his head in response, his heart feeling as though it had been shattered.</p><p>"Kami," he breathed. "So… much pain." His breath stayed shallow and shaky as his tears and sweat fell to the floor. Because of his erratic breathing, Kyuubi lost consciousness as he curled into a fetal position. Kushina tried to shake him awake, but the man was completely dormant.</p><p>"Kami," Kushina whispered as her own breathing became shaky. "I need to get Tsunade; something's not right." She ran out the door in a hurry, leaving it wide open, and the two inside vulnerable to two ninja watching from the shadows. After the woman was too far away to notice their presence, they leaped from the trees and entered the Uzumaki Mansion undetected.</p><p>Everyone got out of her way as Kushina sprinted toward Sakura's house where Tsunade was temporarily staying. "Please let her be here," Kushina begged as she turned the corner and ran into the woman she was looking for.</p><p>"Ouch," Tsunade half-yelled. "Hey, watch it… Kushina-San?"</p><p>"Something's wrong with Naruto and Kyuubi," was all Kushina had to say before Tsunade had her up and running again.</p><p>"What happened?" she asked as they dashed along the rooftops. "Does it have to do with last night?"</p><p>"Maybe," Kushina replied. "Kyuubi was cleaning the blood from Naruto's forehead when he suddenly collapsed. His breathing became shallow and uneven, he began a cold sweat, cried, and then he lost consciousness because of his breathing."</p><p>"I'll have to examine him for myself," Tsunade began. "But are they there alone?" Kushina nodded. "We got a report that two remaining Shadow-Nin are still lurking around; we need to hurry if they're both still unconscious." Kushina immediately quickened her pace along with Tsunade.</p><p>Back at the house: The two Shadow Ninja quietly walked up the stairs, listening for the sounds of possible traps. "You take the redhead; Blondie is mine," the taller one said. His subordinate nodded in agreement. They walked in to see Kyuubi unconscious and Naruto still asleep. "Like taking candy from a sleeping baby. Shadow Art: Chains of Submission," the leader said before black chakra ropes wove themselves around the two.</p><p>"Let's get out of here so we can meet up with that bounty hunter," the younger one suggested. "This place will be crawling with enemies before too long, including the Fifth." The leader nodded as he took Naruto out from under the covers. When he allowed Naruto's head to rest upon his shoulder however, he froze and lost consciousness, scaring and angering his subordinate.</p><p>"What the?" he asked in confusion. He tried to pick up Naruto's head to see what had caused his captain's action, but he was blown from his own mind as horrifying visions overtook kim. "Holy…fuck," he got out before falling over himself.</p><p>Kushina became frightened when she sensed the two enemy's presence and flew up the stairs with a kunai in hand. "Naruto!" she yelled as she threw his door open. Four people now lay on the floor, including the two Shadow Ninja. "What luck," she sighed before replacing her kunai.</p><p>"What's going… well well," Tsunade said with a triumphant look on her face. "If it isn't the two we've been looking for. Let me seal their chakra so that we can deal with Naruto and Kyuubi safely." Kushina nodded. After sealing their chakra, the chains around Naruto and Kyuubi dissipated, allowing Kushina to sit the redhead up. She moved Naruto off of the Shadow Ninja's back to see that some dried blood still encrusted his forehead, but she didn't touch it.</p><p>"Jeez," Tsunade exclaimed. "That's some heart rate. Let me slow it down and stabilize him. He seems to have suffered extreme mental trauma, but I can't tell what caused such fatigue so quickly."</p><p>"That's fine," Kushina said as she felt Naruto's own pulse. He was perfectly fine, but he still slept soundly. "Naruto seems to be alright."</p><p>"Was Kyuubi crying?" Tsunade asked. She received a nod in return. "That opens a few explanations. He should be fine now, but he needs rest. Whatever hit him hit him hard. Let me check on Naruto though, because you said it was when Kyuubi was cleaning him that he collapsed."</p><p>"Yes," Kushina replied. "He was just wiping down Naruto's forehead when he suddenly fell back with terror in his eyes before he lost consciousness." Tsunade brushed some of Naruto's hair aside before noticing the dried blood surrounding the snowflake on Naruto's forehead. She looked closer at it and began to move her hand toward it.</p><p>"Don't… touch it," Kyuubi whispered from behind them, instantly grabbing both women's attention. He was panting and crying, but otherwise, Kyuubi was alright. "I can see that we had some foolish and careless visitors, how appropriate for them to experience that." Kushina and Tsunade both had on a curious and slightly frightful look.</p><p>"Th-that mark," Kyuubi began, "was created after I stopped his rampage in the forest. You all felt those waves of rage and sorrow which made you collapse?" The two women nodded in unison. "When his eyes turned blue again after I emptied my reserves into him, the crimson aurora came down and carved it deeply into his skin."</p><p>"What that tells me now," Kyuubi continued in a quiet voice, "is that he successfully vented all of his emotions, but they're stored in that snowflake upon his forehead." Kushina and Tsunade were both shocked. "I merely took in a fraction of what happened to him over the years, but I was unprepared. You must realize the implications of this by now? I doubt that anyone's life was as tragic as his, so there is enough pain in there to possibly kill someone if he or she were to absorb it all from him."</p><p>"Kami," Kushina began. "Every time he cries into a person's shoulders, this is just going to happen again and again unless we can pull it from him."</p><p>"That's too risky," Kyuubi interjected. "Putting it into an inanimate without Madara's knowledge is asking for disaster to strike. It would blow up and send that pain in waves throughout the village. The only safe way would be for him to play the Nocturne of Sorrows again and again until he empties himself."</p><p>"I'm sorry Kyuubi," Kushina said. "But I'm not going to let him suffer anymore." Kushina's hand shot forward, and her palm rested firmly upon Naruto's mark, making him give off a moan of… pleasure? Kyuubi knew the sounds of lust and physical enjoyment, but this was just strange.</p><p>Kushina screamed and collapsed, signaling to Tsunade that she needed to do something. "Damn, Kushina-San, you were always more passionate and daring than was safe," she said as she began pumping chakra into Kushina to slow down her body's systems. The woman's eyes were wide open and frozen in terror.</p><p>"That was completely reckless!" Kyuubi yelled. "If she had died, Naruto would be torn to shreds in rage and sorrow. What was she thinking?" Kyuubi lightly touched Naruto's mark and took in the very last bit of the boy's overwhelming emotions. "Kami, how did she survive all of that?" he asked as he picked Naruto up and put him on the bed. Another tear escaped his eye. Kushina's had already spilled forth. But these were a mere drop in the bucket compared to the many times that Naruto had cried over the years. His life was Hell; who could blame him for a river of tears?</p><p>"She took in every drop, so one problem solved I guess," Kyuubi said half-heartedly as he used a warm washcloth to finish wiping the dried blood from Naruto's forehead. He took off every bit from the mark in one fierce swipe, making Naruto moan lustfully in his sleep as his back arched. Kyuubi blushed, and so did Tsunade. This will be interesting to say the least, Kyuubi thought to himself as he walked into the bathroom to take care of his "problem."</p><p>Kyuubi sighed as he walked back into the room to see Kushina sitting up and shivering. "Let me warm you up Kushina-San," Kyuubi said as he walked over. The woman nodded her head with her mouth open. Kyuubi put his hands on her back and willed a small amount of Fire-Chakra into her, making it course through her body. "Better?" he asked.</p><p>"Much…thanks… Kyuubi-San," Kushina said with shaky breath. She stood up and did her best to regain her composure, but she simply couldn't hide what she had experienced. "Minato would be in a blind rage at the village if he only knew," she said before leaving the room and tearing up. She walked into her own room and cried wildly into a pillow as she tried to get passed seeing her son's experiences.</p><p>"It is best that you head back with these two ninja while they are still unconscious Tsunade-Sama," Kyuubi said to her without even turning to her. "I'll keep Naruto and Kushina safe; you can count on it." Tsunade nodded and picked up the two intruders before heading back to the village. "Only thirteen days left till Mating Season," Kyuubi said with some worry in his voice. "Thirteen days till I might lose you to another." He kissed Naruto lightly on the cheek and lightly caressed his mark, eliciting a whimper from the boy before falling asleep beside him.</p><p>It was several hours later when Kyuubi awoke again to Kushina opening the bedroom door. Naruto was snoring lightly. "Are the both of you alright?" she asked in a detached tone. She had been wounded deeply by what she had experienced; it was understandable.</p><p>"I know that he is fine. Whether I am or not will be uncovered in time," Kyuubi replied. "Now that he has that mark though, I have to give him 'the talk' before he goes around getting it bumped."</p><p>"Yeah," Kushina whispered. "I'll be in the garden if you need me for anything," she said before closing the door behind her. Kyuubi was sorry for the woman, but it was her own recklessness that had caused her this. Demons could withstand almost anything better than humans could, but she was tough, and that toughness got her this reward.</p><p>"Wake up little man," Kyuubi said as he leaned down to Naruto's ear. Naruto gave no response, so Kyuubi shoved him off the side of the bed, making him land on his chest with a thud.</p><p>"Kyuu?" he asked lazily. "Darn it; I was sleeping pretty well too." Naruto then noticed something that Kyuubi had not: he was hard, rock hard. Kyuubi didn't smell his arousal, a lucky thing for the blond. Although, he might have just been lucky that he couldn't produce that smell yet. "I gotta use the bathroom, be right back," Naruto said as a blush started forming. He turned and entered the rather lavish master bathroom quickly, making Kyuubi curious.</p><p>"What's up with that?" he asked quietly. "Although, he was asleep for like four more hours than usual." He looked down to see his shirt torn up. "Time for a new look," he said brightly. Kyuubi made himself a ninja suit of sorts before dispelling his own clothes. Naruto was unlucky enough to open the door the instant Kyuubi had himself naked. The redhead turned his head to the blond boy with a blank look before asking "you done?"</p><p>Naruto was scarlet red as he closed the door, cutting Kyuubi from his vision. "Aw crap," Kyuubi said after he put on his suit. "I forgot he's still a human in ideology. That had to mortifying." Although, he seemed to almost like it underneath the embarrassment, Kyuubi thought hopingly to himself. This talk's gonna be especially awkward now.</p><p>Naruto sat on the edge of the tub and looked down horrifyingly at the bulge in his pants. Thoughts that Naruto believed shouldn't be there began running through his mind. Why am I thinking like this? Kami, why did I have to see that? At least I was spared seeing his front. This just brought more images of even worse nature into Naruto's mind. NOOO! He screamed inwardly. Naruto then used his friends as a way to get his mind off of the subject. After about three minutes straight of thinking only about how to fix up the village, Naruto's problem went back down. Good boy; now don't come back up, he told himself before opening the door and stepping back into his own room.</p><p>"Naruto," Kyuubi began quietly with no emotion in his voice, "due to your change and the time limit ticking down, I have to talk to you for a bit." The boy sighed before sitting down on his bed.</p><p>"So this has to do with the Bijuu?" he asked.</p><p>"This has to do with you being a Bijuu," Kyuubi corrected him. "Due to your upbringing, this is going to be awkward." Naruto breathed heavily, but he looked Kyuubi in the eye. "Since you are seventeen, I have no way out of telling you about this because of how serious a matter it is."</p><p>"What? Am I gonna go like, berserk for a while when I turn eighteen?" Naruto asked with a look of concern on his face.</p><p>"Not the way you're thinking of, and the time I'm mentioning is much closer than that" Kyuubi began. "Promise me that you will listen to the whole thing before going off on a tangent Naruto, because it is already hard enough." The boy nodded as he resigned himself to this conversation. "Thirteen days from now is when Demon, including Bijuu, Mating Season begins." Naruto's eyes widened. He knows, the boy told himself. "As old as you are, and having just become a Bijuu, this will all hit you hard and hit you fast. And I'm sorry that this couldn't happen say a month from now, but I've got no choice."</p><p>"Even right before Mating Season, you may begin to think about sex more than you usually would, which you and I both know you never did," Kyuubi said passively. "You paid enough attention during health class to know what I'm talking about though." Naruto grimaced and blushed. "Yes, it's embarrassing because of how you've been brought up as a human; I know, but you're a demon now, which means we've gotta do this." Naruto nodded.</p><p>"First of all, you need to burn this into your mind. Thinking about it and about having it with people is completely natural and acceptable," Kyuubi said with a serious look on his face. Naruto was entirely surprised by what he was saying. "Humans are raised to believe very different things than we demons do, so this will come as a shock. Demons commonly bed both sexes, especially male demons, and many same-sex couples exist legitimately in Demon society."</p><p>Naruto stared at Kyuubi in surprise, unable to speak. "I have to tell you this, because you have absolutely no experience in the love and lust department, which is why I told you about demons not caring about homosexuality. In our society, that isn't even a word, and demons who bed the same sex are not considered gay. We demons are brought up in a much more peaceful way than you might think. We view both sexes as being beautiful in their respective ways, so there is no discrimination. The only way a couple is considered illegitimate is when it would be incest. Cousins can be legitimate bed partners, but not direct family, meaning the predecessors of parents, siblings, and the parents themselves."</p><p>"So then…" Naruto began until Kyuubi stopped him dead.</p><p>"You promised," he said sternly. "I'm telling you this, because if your eyes get caught by another male, it won't seem as uncomfortable. Just trust me Naruto. Anything that you think during or prior to Mating Season, and even during everyday life, is perfectly natural, whether you are a human or another creature. Go ahead; you can explode now," Kyuubi said slightly humorously. But no response came from the blond except,</p><p>"interesting." Kyuubi was stunned, even if he didn't show it. "I'm hungry; let's go see if mom wants to go somewhere or if we are eating here," the blond said with a smile. Well, if it's a part of this time of year, so be it, Naruto thought with relief. Thank Kami Kyuubi doesn't know about 'that.' Kyuubi turned to follow him with a passive face on, but his mind was a train wreck.</p><p>This can't be happening, he thought to himself. No one, demon or human, can take that talk and walk away smiling. Maybe I should have explained the rest and asked him…DAMN! I forgot. Grr. Redo! Oh man, I forgot to tell him about the mark as well. NOT GOOD!</p><p>They walked down into the kitchen to find Kushina not there. "She said she'd be in the garden while I gave you 'the talk,'" Kyuubi said flatly. They walked onto the porch to find Kushina lying back in a bunch of blue hyacinths. "Naruto's hungry," Kyuubi called out to her, making Kushina look back. "Do you want to head out or stay here?"</p><p>"I'm in the mood for some fish, how about you guys?" Kushina asked as she got up, her face smiling brightly.</p><p>"I could go for that," Naruto said. "But no fishcakes."</p><p>"Agreed," all three said at once.</p><p>"I've gotta go deal with a little squabble guys," Naruto said. "Konohamaru's being show-offy again." He blurred from sight, leaving Kyuubi and Kushina alone.</p><p>"His hearing abilities are stunning," Kyuubi said. "I can barely hear that brat's whining."</p><p>"How'd your little lecture go?" Kushina asked. Kyuubi paused.</p><p>"I was expecting him to blow up and start questioning the living daylights out of me, but that didn't happen," Kyuubi said calmly.</p><p>"Sounds like it went better than expected," Kushina said happily.</p><p>"It's not over," Kyuubi said, making her turn expecting to hear really bad news. "A: I didn't ask him about his own feelings and experiences, B: I forgot to mention exactly how he will be affected during Mating Season."</p><p>"Kyuuuuubiii," Kushina nagged. "I trusted you."</p><p>"Don't worry," the redhead began. "And don't talk as loudly; Naruto probably actually just heard everything. Anyway, I have time, and he knows he'll start thinking about sexual activity and that his choice is natural whether he chooses a male or female, and it is completely acceptable. I just haven't told him about the impaired judgment, the way his mark reacts when it's touched, or asked him if he's yet experienced thinking about someone and getting an uncomfortable response."</p><p>"You have until tomorrow, or I'm telling him," Kushina warned. Kyuubi grabbed her by the arm, stopping her from walking away, making their eyes meet.</p><p>"Don't interfere Kushina," he said calmly. "I know you want to protect him, and it's a novel concept, but I have to be the one that explains this to him. He'll just be more embarrassed about talking about himself possibly preferring men if he talks to you, his own human mother. I have experience with explaining this. Just give me another day before you punish me."</p><p>"Okay, you're right," Kushina replied. "And good luck with asking whether or not he likes you." They both smiled. Naruto suddenly blurred back as Kyuubi lowered his arm. Both he and Kushina switched their expressions to ones of cheer. "Hey Naruto, let's go," Kushina said happily.</p><p>"Okay, onto lunch," he yelled. It appeared that he had not heard a smidge of what Kyuubi and Kushina had discussed. They sat down in a restaurant Kushina knew from the good old days.</p><p>"I'm stuffed," Naruto said after taking down the last of the Mahi-Mahi he had ordered. The price of the meal wasn't bad overall. $50 for three people, including Naruto, was by no means expensive when it came to fish. "As I said, a single fish is perfectly fine, but fishcakes, ugh." Kyuubi and the boy's mom nodded in agreement. "With Akatsuki dead," Naruto began, "things are going to get really boring soon."</p><p>"It will be a long time before we're done doing missions Naruto," Kyuubi replied in an even tone. "There are many smaller countries, and the entire Land of Shadow, that will do everything they can to keep a permanent treaty from being formed, and there are still plenty of escort missions and assassinations from time to time."</p><p>"Still," Naruto began. "All that is left are my Chuunin Exams and dealing with the Bijuu. Shukaku is gonna be one tough nut to crack." Kyuubi nodded in agreement.</p><p>"We have to attend the funeral later though," Kushina said as they left the restaurant. Naruto frowned, but he didn't groan like the day before. "Conjure up the traditional wares before we leave the house later Naruto. I have to ask Tsunade some stuff about truly getting Minato's money back into our pockets, because I'm getting near the end of my rope. I'll see you two in maybe an hour or so, bye," she said before looking at Kyuubi specifically and walking off toward Sakura's house.</p><p>"I'll race you home Naruto," Kyuubi said before blurring away.</p><p>"No fair," the blond called before fading in dust. He still beat Kyuubi home by about one one-thousandth of a second though. "So what do you want to do?" he asked. "We could spar." Kyuubi held up his hand to stop the boy.</p><p>"Unfortunately, here comes part two of the earlier discussion," he said, making Naruto slump in annoyance.</p><p>"What more is there?" Naruto asked in dread.</p><p>"Before I explain anything Naruto, I need to ask you a couple of questions," the redhead told him before sitting down on a stone bench. Naruto followed suit. "First, and you do need to answer this truthfully, have you yet experienced a dream or suddenly become stuck thinking about having sex with a particular person?" Naruto groaned and blushed. "The truth Naruto," he said in a serious tone.</p><p>"Yeah," the boy admitted quietly as his blush deepened.</p><p>"I see you aren't very comfortable, which means you're embarrassed about it," Kyuubi said factually. "Second question: is this person male or female? I do need the truth for this one as well." Naruto screamed in his mind to run, but Kyuubi wouldn't let him if he tried.</p><p>"Male," Naruto replied with a slight groan as his blush darkened further still. Kyuubi became delighted in his mind, but he knew not to make assumptions; it could be a number of male friends the boy had, especially the Uchiha.</p><p>"Ah, which means that your human beliefs are conflicting with what you at least think you desire," Kyuubi said in a still calm tone. He still smiled reassuringly. "Go with what your heart tells you, but don't rush things. A concrete belief in demon society is that one seeking a mate should try to gain affection before anything physical. Demons do take lovers and mere temporary bed partners to relieve themselves during Mating Season, so, evaluate whether you actually love this person before you jump right into a physical relationship. While it is perfectly natural and acceptable to sate your desires during Mating Season, if you are in search of a lifelong partner, you should first consider your true, not hormone-influenced feelings for this person before you procreate. This will encourage the formation of a bond you may one day share."</p><p>"Final questions," Kyuubi began. "Answer the first in your own mind. The second one is something you need to tell me. Who is this person? And, do you truly love him?"</p><p>Naruto didn't have to think about the first one. But did he truly love Kyuubi? The boy started thinking quickly to himself in hopes of an answer. He tried so hard just to gain my trust, and he's helping me now. I don't know if I love him! Kyuu is much closer to me than a lot of people though. I nicknamed him for Pete's sake. Now that he's out, he does his best to help me understand his world while he continually respects, tolerates, and tries to understand me. He does everything he can, but does he love me? What should I say?</p><p>Kyuubi looked longingly at Naruto lost in his deep concentration. If only Kyuubi could reach out right then and admit his own love for the wolf-boy. But he knew that Naruto had to make his own choice. With him being so young, he needed to make his own choice without being directly influenced in such a way.</p><p>He's six-hundred-years older. He probably has a mate already. Oh man…I just have to say it. He'll understand, right? Here goes, the blond thought to himself.</p><p>"Yes," Naruto replied. He held back the tears of worry carefully that threatened to overtake him. Kyuubi smiled, but he still wished he could satisfy his own feelings for Naruto.</p><p>"Then follow your heart Naruto," Kyuubi said brightly. "If you truly believe you love him, even if you think he may not love you back, pursue this person. If he rejects you, he missed out on someone special, and it means that this person is not meant for you." Naruto rose as a tear fell from his eye. Kyuubi smiled half-heartedly, knowing he was not the boy's pick.</p><p>Before Kyuubi could even process his own thoughts, he heard Naruto say "Kyuubi… I love you." There was a pause as Kyuubi's expression dropped while trying to process this information in shock. Naruto felt torn apart by his look, believing it to be disbelief, and began turning away to run with a hurt look on his face, but Kyuubi grabbed hold of his arm and pulled Naruto into his arms and against him. Naruto was stunned, but he didn't move at all.</p><p>"You have no idea how much I wished for you to say that Naruto," Kyuubi said as he teared up and rested his chin on the blond's shoulder. They boy smiled and cried openly as he embraced Kyuubi in a whirlwind of happiness and passion. Kyuubi paused in his own crying before asking "why do you think you love me?"</p><p>Naruto told him everything he could come up with. "Because you try to understand me Kyuubi, it's because you actually care about me. Even my friends can't do anything compared with what you have done for me. Even when I was in the deepest of darkness right after my body had changed, you still did what you thought was best for me. I love you Kyuubi; please believe me."</p><p>"You don't care that I'm so much older? You have no experience," Kyuubi said, trying to make sure this wasn't some hollow moment of passion. Naruto shook his head.</p><p>"I just don't know if I could be that close to you. I imagine you already have a mate, so why would you want me?" he asked in genuine curiosity and sadness.</p><p>"I'm going to tell you a secret Naruto," Kyuubi began. "I don't have a mate; I never have. Nibi turned me away when I fell in love with her. That was more than five-hundred years ago. Do you know what else that means?" he asked. Naruto shook his head.</p><p>"You're my first partner in all of time Naruto. You're that precious to me," Kyuubi said as he kissed Naruto passionately on the lips. He didn't invade with his tongue to show his restraint and his true feelings, but Naruto could feel the emotion and truth coursing through Kyuubi. As he pulled away, Naruto looked up joyfully into Kyuubi's eyes. Even as only red slits, Naruto saw so much passion in them, making him feel warm and protected, just as how his father's love made him feel.</p><p>"Kyuu, I… I'm really your first?" The redhead nodded. "Kami you're amazing." Naruto locked their lips together clumsily, but Kyuubi understood him perfectly. They hugged tightly before finally releasing their grips. They both wiped away their tears before setting off toward the mansion.</p><p>"Oh, one last thing Naruto," Kyuubi said as he stopped walking.</p><p>"Yeah Kyuu?" he asked with a smile. The boy's affection was beyond all normal limits of obvious, but Kyuubi loved him all the more because of that. "What is it?"</p><p>"First, make a shiny ice mirror please," Kyuubi asked. Naruto was curious, but he complied. "Now, look at the center of your forehead in the mirror." Naruto's eyes widened in shock as he stared at the new silvery snowflake. He reached up and traced it lightly, causing a pleasurable sensation.</p><p>"I wouldn't do that Naruto," Kyuubi said as he reached up and pulled Naruto's hand away. After gripping the blond's hand, his claw lightly scratched the mark, pulling a lustful and embarrassing moan from Naruto's mouth. "Sorry," Kyuubi said with a grimace. "Although, it seems to be far more sensitive to the touch of others than it is to your own."</p><p>"Ya, it is," Naruto said as he turned around and dealt with his newly-gained erection the same way Kyuubi had a couple days before, making the kitsune giggle and blush. "Anyway, where'd it come from?" the boy asked with a look of displeasure.</p><p>"From when you were playing music inside that ice dome," Kyuubi began. "I have to explain the song you were playing at some other point, but, the thing is, you kind of went berserk under your own pain and rage." Naruto's expression turned to one of terror. "No one was hurt, but when I calmed you back down, the aurora which came out from the dome when it first split open, which had turned crimson red by this point, came down and carved that mark into your forehead. You were asleep for quite a long time after, and I cleaned the blood off from your face, forehead, and hair. When I brushed up against that mark the first time, I realized how much of your pent up emotion was stored in there and was knocked out. But more importantly, it seems to be a pleasure mechanism as well, because it is very sensitive to both the touch of others and your own. I'm just warning you to not bump into things or to let others touch it unless you give them warning."</p><p>"Alright Kyuu," Naruto said before he pecked the kitsune on the lips. "We still have to go to that funeral in like forty-five minutes, so we should get back to the house real quick." Naruto and Kyuubi both blurred off the path and came up to the house.</p><p>"Let's go inside and change into mourner's clothes real quick," Naruto said as he willed his chakra into the seal on the door. It was a small amount, but this seal, like the one on his current bedroom, was destroyed by the boy's power. "Grr," the boy said aloud. The two walked up into Minato's room quietly.</p><p>"You can go in the bathroom to change if you want your privacy Naruto," Kyuubi said as he looked out the window absent mindedly. He turned to see the boy fully naked and forming hand signs to summon new clothes. The Kitsune blushed at the boy's appearance, but he was becoming dangerously aroused too, and when Naruto paused, Kyuubi became frightened.</p><p>"I'm an idiot," he said aloud. "I should have gone into the bathroom to change. Sorry to make you see me like this." Naruto conjured up the traditional black shirt, slacks, and good shoes. Sniff sniff. "Kyuubi?" he began. "Are you okay?" Naruto began blushing deeper, but as he continued to inhale the scent of Kyuu's arousal, he himself began falling victim to his own hormones in the same way.</p><p>"Naruto, you're so beautiful," Kyuubi said with passion in his eyes. He closed the distance between himself and Naruto before taking the boy in a passionate kiss. Naruto didn't really mind it, and even found it to be embarrassingly flattering until Kyuubi began licking his bottom lip. Naruto was unsure of what this meant, so he let his instincts take over for a second, opening his mouth and giving the redhead entrance. This felt slightly uncomfortable to the boy because he had no control, and Kyuubi's tongue was ravishing him without restraint, but he didn't resist until the kitsune ground his hips lightly into Naruto's.</p><p>Naruto's look changed to one of fear and anger, and he broke the kiss before raking his left hand across Kyuubi's face. "Oooowwww," Kyuubi yipped as he collapsed onto his knees. Blood trickled down from where Naruto had cut him deeply. He looked up at a frightened Naruto. The boy began backing away. Only then did Kyuubi realize what had happened and why.</p><p>"Naruto… I," he began.</p><p>"I thought you said demons tried to gain affection and trust before doing anything physical Kyuu," Naruto said fearfully as tears came to his eyes. "Yet, you just overstepped that boundary like it wasn't even there. You lied to me," the boy said before collapsing in a corner. He examined his own claws to see them streaked with Kyuubi's blood.</p><p>"No, Naruto, I…I didn't mean to…" Kyuubi tried to apologize, but Naruto interceded.</p><p>"You lied to me and used me for your own wants Kyuu," Naruto said as he cried. "You never meant what you said about loving me did you?" Kyuubi took a deep blow to the heart by these words.</p><p>"Let me explain Naruto."</p><p>"You just want my body for Mating Season. How can I blame you though? No one has ever loved me, ever really cared about me as a person." Naruto now sobbed openly, leaving Kyuubi heartbroken and terrified.</p><p>"No," he began. "That was wrong of me Naruto. I just… didn't control myself like I should have. It was my own desires. I'm sorry Naruto. Even older and more mature demons like me are highly affected by Mating Season nearing. I want your love first Naruto; please believe me," Kyuubi said with desperation in his eyes. Naruto activated his Kikánugan and searched the fox's mind and heart. Kyuubi wasn't lying; he was just overtaken for a short moment.</p><p>"There is one final important thing I should tell you about Mating Season Naruto, otherwise, you'd be disadvantaged, and it wouldn't be fair," Kyuubi began. The boy listened tentatively as he ceased his crying. "Because we are at the height of our desire and 'need' for procreation, our judgment will be impaired to some extent, like just now, only far worse." Naruto's expression turned to one of fear. "Burn this into your mind Naruto. I love you, no matter what. So, if at any time you feel uncomfortable, invaded, or if you feel your boundaries are breached, you need to tell me right away, before I take it further. I will do everything I can to respect your every wish Naruto, and you must resist the urge as best you can as well until we are both sure that you are emotionally ready to handle sexual activity. Stuff like this scars people for life Naruto; I don't ever want to do that to you, so you have to warn me. I don't want to lose you as a partner or as yourself."</p><p>Naruto sniffled before saying, "alright Kyuu. But, what are we going to do when we are actually in the middle of Mating Season? It's gonna be easy to be tempted in the middle of the night."</p><p>"I have two fail safes set up for this. Well, one is whether or not your other room is rebuilt in time. If it is, then we should have no problem whatsoever. If it isn't, I have asked Kushina, yes, she knows, to keep an eye on us. She knows about us being in our states, and she knows that I won't purposely do anything to you outside your wishes."</p><p>"Thanks Kyuu," Naruto told him. "Are you okay? You're still bleeding." Kyuubi pulled his hand off his cheek to realize that his own chakra was not closing his wound. His expression changed to one of fear as he sniffed at the blood on his fingers.</p><p>"Poison!" he yelled. Naruto could see the lines where he had slashed Kyuubi becoming black. "Shit! This isn't good. You're a ten-tailed demon, which means your poison is the most powerful in the entire demon world at this point. While its speed develops with your age, the effects already exist. You're so young; this is both unprecedented and dangerous. No antidote to your poison exists."</p><p>"No," Naruto whispered. "You won't die, will you?"</p><p>"Demons are immortal, not invincible Naruto," Kyuubi said. "By loss of enough blood, by being poisoned badly enough, or by an incurable disease, even demons can die. We need to see Tsunade, now Naruto, it's burning and spreading."</p><p>"There's no time Kyuu. We don't know how far it's gotten," Naruto replied. "I'm gonna let my instincts go wild for a sec here. I should be able to do something, but I don't know what." Kyuubi was unsure of what the boy meant until he came over and began licking the redhead's wounds. Naruto's tongue slipped into the cuts and cleaned them out perfectly. Naruto then swallowed his own poison before actually biting Kyuubi's cheek with his canines and drawing the poison out of the surrounding tissue. Kyuubi was stunned by how sharp the boy's teeth were and by how well his instincts guided him. The feeling of having his own blood sucked from his skin was frightening, but the burning sensation was dying away. Naruto swallowed what blood he held in his mouth along with the poison before licking away what remained around the puncture wounds.</p><p>"That's amazing Naruto," he spoke up. Kyuubi's wounds now began closing of their own accord, signaling Naruto's success. "You have incredible instincts. There's no way you could have known that swallowing your own poison would be safe. That's the lesson for today: in normal life, follow your instincts. When dealing with emotions and procreation, listen to your instincts, but use your brain to double check your own feelings."</p><p>"Kyuu," Naruto teased. The wolf-boy leaned down and stole a light kiss from his redhead before helping him up. "I hope those don't scar."</p><p>"As fast as they're healing, they shouldn't," Kyuubi reassured him. "Now, turn around so that I may get dressed without you going nuts."</p><p>"Nope," Naruto replied with a smile. "My turn to get an eyeful, Kyuu-San." Kyuubi smirked at the boy.</p><p>"Perhaps Jiraiya did rub off on you…pervert," he said before dispelling his clothes. Naruto blushed and kissed Kyuubi more passionately, but he felt perfectly normal and was not automatically aroused while being around the one he loved, even when he was buck naked. "I'm infinitely joyous that you have feelings of love for me Naruto, you know that?" Kyuubi asked with a smile as he wrapped his hands behind Naruto's neck.</p><p>"Ya," Naruto replied. They shared another soft kiss. "And do you know how thankful I am that I can be with you?" Naruto mimicked the kitsune's action.</p><p>"Yes, Naruto." Kyuubi hugged him closely. "I know you've been so afraid, so exhausted, so sad and angry for all these passed years. That's why I'm so glad that you followed your heart, even when your upbringing advised otherwise."</p><p>"And I'm so glad that I'm truly your first partner. I'm also thankful that you stayed alone for six-hundred and some years without taking a mate, because then we couldn't be together or be this close, could we?" Naruto asked his redheaded kitsune. Their eyes shone brightly with emotion and true love for each other. Lust wasn't anywhere in the picture, and that's what Naruto wanted. Lust could wait until he was ready for it.</p><p>"If I had taken another mate Naruto, I'd be heartbroken now," Kyuubi told him as moved his hands through Naruto's golden hair. "I can promise you this Naruto. If I had taken another mate, and all of this had happened the same way, I would have regretted making that choice, and I would have risked my life to try and be with you for the short amount of time that I could." Naruto was unsure of what he meant and gave Kyuubi a look of confusion.</p><p>"In our society, mates are permanent partners that cannot ever be released from the bond of being together," Kyuubi began. "Mates, by law, must abstain themselves from having affairs with others, and when an affair does occur, the betraying mate and his or her bed partner are sentenced to death." Naruto became frightful of this. Something deep within his mind warned him of this, but he could not figure out why.</p><p>"I never told Kushina, but when two make the conscious decision to become mates, they make a mark on each other during procreation," Kyuubi told him. "The mark is both physical and metaphorical. But my point is that, this is what we call mating, or what humans call consummation." Naruto was in awe at the concept. "When the marks are made, and both demons consciously put a mark on each other of their own free will, the marks become permanent through ancient magic. They represent the decision and the formation of a sacred bond that is not meant to ever be severed or betrayed. This is why the death penalty is the immediate punishment for betrayers of their mate's boundless love and undying trust. It is also the duty of other demons to keep mates from betraying each other. This is why the one whom with the betrayer procreates is sentenced to death as well."</p><p>"Kyuubi, you would betray another for me, even if it was Nibi?" Naruto asked. Kyuubi lost his expression for a second before he cleared his throat to explain.</p><p>"Naruto, don't be jealous by what I'm about to say, because you haven't experienced what I have," Kyuubi told him. Naruto's eyes lost their shine, but he nodded. "I loved Nibi deeply, and I would not take a mate unless I loved that person deeply enough. I tried to take Nibi as a mate, but she refused me. I will never forget her, because I do still love her, but she has moved on and taken a mate other than me." Naruto wasn't sure where Kyuubi was going with this, so he just kept on a passive face.</p><p>"My love runs deeply for the both of you, and, if Nibi were my mate now, and you alone, I wouldn't be able to live without having both of you close to me," Kyuubi said as he looked Naruto in the eyes. "What I am saying Naruto is that I could not choose between you, that I would take both of you if I could." Naruto was slightly hurt by this, but he understood what he meant. "But remember what I said about if the person you love rejects you? If he or she turns you away, either the person isn't ready, or he or she isn't meant to be with you, something that is decided by decisions in life and partially by fate."</p><p>Naruto finally understood what the handsome kitsune was saying. His love for both him and Nibi was endless, meaning that he couldn't choose one over the other. But he knew that fate would always play a role. Since Nibi rejected Kyuubi, Kyuubi and Naruto were allowed to become partners at the very least. After his eyes lit back up, Naruto and Kyuubi took each other's heads in their arms and began kissing like there was no tomorrow.</p><p>Kushina opened the door to Naruto's bedroom to see the two embracing lovingly. While that wasn't particularly shocking, seeing all of Kyuubi in his glory was scary. Their kissing wasn't lustful or full of tongue, the movements gave no hint of them taking it further, and what was more, Kyuubi had no erection. Kushina was completely relieved, but this was still more than she needed to see. Naruto was in his funeral wares at the least, so Kushina had a small idea of how this came about, but she would never know the whole story. It would remain a secret between demon lovers.</p><p>When the two finally came up for air and opened their eyes to look at each other, Kushina noticed how much emotion and love truly flowed between the two young men. Kyuubi may have been six-hundred and some, but he certainly looked to not be much older than Naruto, so it seemed natural enough.</p><p>Kyuubi was the first to notice Kushina, because Naruto was distracted by looking at him, but he noticed a presence as well, hoping it wasn't his mom. They both turned with guilty and hesitant eyes while still holding each other close.</p><p>"I'm in trouble, aren't I?" Naruto asked his mom. He couldn't make his eyes meet with hers because of how ashamed he felt by allowing her to see this. When he finally did look up, Kushina smiled at him.</p><p>"Neither of you are in trouble, although, Kyuubi, could you please dress yourself for the funeral?" she asked. Kyuubi finally released his hold on Naruto and conjured the same type of clothing. "I merely wish I hadn't seen quite so much of Kyuubi," she said blushing. "Naruto, I love you, and Kyuubi explained everything to me. You're still my son; it doesn't matter to me if you love Kyuubi as long as he loves you in return. And he does, so I have no problem with you being intimate and kissing. Although, I would not want to walk in on anything beyond what I just saw. I would be kind of secretive about this relationship of yours though. Naruto's friends will probably still accept him, but I have no idea how the rest of the village would react."</p><p>"Naruto is the most powerful being on Earth next to the Gods and other higher immortal beings that are unseen, so the villagers' opinions don't matter," Kyuubi said in confidence, but his expression quickly changed. "They might go at your friends though…fine, I'll behave in public unless Naruto wishes to unveil our little secret as well."</p><p>"Thanks Kyuu," Naruto said before grabbing his chin and kissing the redhead lightly on the cheek. "Shall we be off?" Naruto asked happily. Kyuubi and Kushina quickly followed him out the door.</p><p>"May I ask what exactly happened?" Kushina inquired. She was puzzled by the scratches on the side of Kyuubi's face, and then Kushina noticed the dry blood on Naruto's right hand. "Did you guys get into a fight Naruto? Your hand's got blood on it, and Kyuubi's face is scratched. The two looked at each other and grimaced.</p><p>"I'll wash my hand off mom, and ya, we did have a bit of a confrontation, but…um… Kyuu, why don't you explain things to her?" Naruto asked before fading in dust.</p><p>"Coward," Kyuubi called out with a smile. "I told you that our judgment would be impaired during and a bit before Mating Season. Unfortunately, I had my first lapse, signaling that I've got to watch it from today on until after Mating Season."</p><p>"You didn't try to actually…" Kushina began with a shocked face on.</p><p>"No, no no no no no no no, nooo!" Kyuubi interjected, stopping Kushina in her tracks. "Naruto was a lot more self-confident and open-minded than I would have guessed he could become in one day, so he wasn't embarrassed to change while I was in the room. I happened to be staring out the window thinking on the past when he dispelled his clothing. When I turned and saw him fully naked, I was instantly captivated and I kissed him more passionately than we agreed was allowed." Kushina had on a calm but serious look on. She nodded for him to continue.</p><p>"I didn't just shove my tongue into his mouth like some pig; I licked his bottom lip and basically asked, but I was controlling the whole thing, and I should have sensed his discomfort."</p><p>"He attacked you just because of that?" Kushina exclaimed. Kyuubi shock his head.</p><p>"No, I took it one step too far altogether, one that contradicted what I taught him and what I had promised not to do," Kyuubi said shamefully. "I didn't stick my hand anywhere, but I rocked my hips gently against his, making him afraid or disgusted enough to defend himself. It was only after he had sliced my cheek open that I realized I had lost control." Kushina wasn't angry with him. It was a very minor thing compared with what he could have done, but she still had a flat look on that showed her understanding of the situation.</p><p>"I'm done giving him the talk by the way," Kyuubi ended. Kushina was finally able to understand how he regained Naruto's trust, so she was now at ease.</p><p>"I'm the mother of a human turned demon going into his first heat with another male demon guiding him and being his lover of sorts, how lucky for me," Kushina said sarcastically. "Thank you for helping him through this Kyuubi, and I wish you two the best of luck with your relationship."</p><p>"And I thank you for trusting me with your son Kushina-San," he replied. Naruto suddenly returned in a blur with a clean right hand. "Remember not to let anyone touch that mark on your forehead without giving your friends warning Naruto. I'll be with you, but still." The blond nodded and brought Kyuu in for one light kiss before they came upon the main road.</p><p>Since the group walked at normal speed, it took the three a while to reach the memorial area. Sakura, Sasuke, and Kakashi were all there waiting for them. And in the distance, Naruto could hear Tsunade and the funeral procession coming.</p><p>"Hey Naruto, Kushina-San, Kyuubi… how are you guys?" Sakura called. Naruto waved back and started walking up to them. "Where'd that mark on your forehead come from Naruto?" Sakura parted Naruto's hair to see a glittering snowflake. She touched it lightly with her index finger, making Naruto tingle all over. He stepped back and grabbed her hand lightly.</p><p>"Don't touch it," Naruto began. "I got it after Kyuubi stopped me from rampaging that night when I was playing music to vent. As per how we are, we're doing fine." He gave Sakura a quick hug. It had been a while since any of them could talk. Akatsuki had fallen a couple days before, but none of them had gotten the time to talk. Kakashi gave his trademark grin and wave, and Sasuke just exchanged looks of greeting with the boy.</p><p>"I still can't believe you got turned into a demon dobe," Sasuke spoke with a smirk. "You're so different, and yet, you're still the same guy. You never cease to amaze me Naruto."</p><p>"And you're as impassive as ever Sasuke-Teme," Naruto retorted, receiving an irked look from Sasuke. Kyuubi smiled at how easily two friends could rile each other up.</p><p>"Sheesh, it's getting hot. I like that the summer weather returned, but it's gotta be a hundred degrees at least," Kakashi said. "I wish it would get cloudy and maybe even rain like it did at the Third's funeral." Naruto looked up.</p><p>"My chakra's not making clouds?" he asked in amazement. "Maybe that problem's solved." Kyuubi tapped him on the shoulder before saying,</p><p>"that power is sealed in that snowflake of yours if you want to make it get cloudy. I wouldn't make it snow, but I agree with the snow-haired pervert. Some shade would be nice. Just will for the snowflake to release that power a bit, but don't let it go all out."</p><p>Naruto did as the kitsune commanded, and by the time Tsunade came into view, clouds filled the sky, and the temperature dropped by five degrees.</p><p>"Thank you very much Naruto-Kun," Kushina said as she put away her little fan. They all fell in tow behind Tsunade, and in another five minutes, the temperature had dropped to eighty, and they stood in front of the swirling flame statue.</p><p>"We stand here to celebrate the lives and mourn the deaths of those who died in the battle two and a half days passed," Tsunade opened. "Letters have been sent to every family along with a small sum of money that was earned through donations. While it cannot by any means replace a lost family member, we hope that it can provide financial relief until that family can get back on its feet."</p><p>"Let us not forget what we fought for those days ago, the eternal peace between the Shinobi Nations, and to save the final two jinchuuriki from Akatsuki. Killerbee went home to be with his family and to support his village after such a blow to its military, but Naruto stands with us today as a reminder that our efforts were not in vain, members of the numerous villages that stood with us. Naruto, Kyuubi, would you two please…"</p><p>They blurred several feet behind Tsunade and changed into their demon forms before she had even finished her sentence. "Thank you," Tsunade said after turning around.</p><p>"Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox stands to my left, and his former jinchuuriki, Naruto, stands to my right. Two great miracles occurred after Madara fell two days ago. One, Kyuubi was released from Naruto without killing the boy. The other miracle was that Naruto was turned into the Juubi no Okami, the Ten-Tailed Wolf. He stands here as both a dear friend of the alliance being formed and as the peaceful ruler of the Bijuu. Naruto has promised his efforts in keeping Bijuu and human relations peaceful, especially in the case of the Ichibi no Shukaku."</p><p>"And that promise remains steadfast, my allies," Naruto spoke up in his deeper voice. "With Kyuubi as my mentor, I am learning both the Bijuu's history and their ways of life. Together, we will spare no effort in creating an everlasting equilibrium between the world of demons and the world of men."</p><p>"You may all pay your respects. We are building a second memorial with all five signs of the Great Shinobi Nations where we will eventually place all of our dear comrades' bodies, unless some families wish to bury lost ones elsewhere," Tsunade began after nodding to Naruto in respect. "The wall of this new memorial will have two names upon each brick to represent the ones who stood with us. And there will be a plaque made for each one who died. We have embalmed all of the dead bodies, so those who wish to bring loved ones back all the way to their countries do not have to suffer the smell of their loved ones rotting. May the battle of the five hidden allies never be forgotten by history, and may the alliance stand strong." Everyone cheered at the end of her speech, and Kyuubi and Naruto released a howl together. They then changed into their clothed human forms.</p><p>"Well said Naruto," Kyuubi complimented before gesturing for him to leave with Kushina. "Shall we leave then?" he asked her. Kushina nodded before taking the two young men back to the Uzumaki Mansion. Naruto waved at Kakashi, Sakura, and Sasuke before leaving. They all smiled back at him and waved the trio good-bye.</p><p>"Well done Naruto," Kyuubi said before kissing him lightly. "Did I forget to mention how beautiful you are when you're in your wolf form?"</p><p>"Yes," Naruto began. "And did I forget to mention how strong you look when you are in your fox form?" Kyuubi laughed lightly and kissed the boy again. He knew how much Naruto cared, and he used his teasing perfectly.</p><p>"Okay, okay, get a room you two," Kushina said with a smile. "I swear, Naruto, you're as bad as most girls when they have their first boyfriends. It's cute, but it's cheesy too."</p><p>"Sorry mom," Naruto replied with a giggle before stealing a kiss of his own from Kyuubi and following her. "I also need to stop my chakra real quick." Naruto stopped in the middle of the path and concentrated on resealing his powers. It was sixty degrees already, so now they all felt a bit chilly. "It should warm back up soon enough once the clouds disperse," the blond said cheerfully.</p><p>"It's nice to be back home," Kyuubi said as he entered the house. "Naruto, go change while I have a small word with Kushina will you?"</p><p>"Oh, okay Kyuubi," he replied before walking upstairs.</p><p>"What do you want to talk to me about?" Kushina asked curiously. "Does it have to do with your fight?"</p><p>"A bit," he replied. "I had no way of knowing, but Naruto has developed poison glands at the bases of each nail." Kushina's eyes widened. "When he sliced open my cheek, he went into a corner and started rightfully going on about how I betrayed his trust, but at the end, he asked if I was alright, because I was still bleeding. My chakra wasn't closing the wound, and when I sniffed the blood on my fingers, I realized he had used his premature poison by accident."</p><p>"This is dangerous, isn't it?" Kushina asked in an even tone. She didn't seem frightened, but Kushina was concerned. "What happens if he uses it accidentally on someone else?"</p><p>"After this, could you ask Tsunade to come over and examine his claws?" the redhead asked, receiving a nod in return. "As I said, he defended himself out of fear or disgust, or maybe even both. I'm pretty sure the poison was released because of this. I do want to be absolutely sure though, because as he gets older, the potency will increase, and the time it takes for it to kill will decrease. If you get scratched before we are sure, have him clean the wound with his own tongue." Kushina was dumbfounded by this.</p><p>"That's what he did to clean the poison out of my cheek. After thoroughly cleaning the slices themselves, he used his canines to break into the surrounding tissue, and he drained this area too of poison. It might be terrifying to have your blood sucked out by your own son, but the poison's effects are still unknown, so we must be careful, because no antidote exists for a ten-tailed demon's poison yet."</p><p>"I'll get Tsunade right away. Thank you for the warning Kyuubi," Kushina said before flying out the door.</p><p>"Come out Naruto. It's not a big deal," Kyuubi called. "You've been sitting on the stairwell almost the entire time." The boy appeared with a small smile, but there was some fright in his eyes as well. "I'm perfectly fine, and the sooner we get your poison examined, the sooner we can have an antidote ready. We also need to know if it flows of its own accord or if it is a defense mechanism. If you dug your claws into me during say sexual activity, and poisoned me as I fell asleep, we'd have a far worse situation on our hands."</p><p>"I just don't want to hurt anyone," was Naruto's response. He began tearing up. "I'm sorry I hurt you Kyuu. I was just…so scared." Kyuubi took the boy in his arms and began rubbing his shoulder and head lovingly.</p><p>"I know Naruto. I just have to be a lot more aware now that Mating Season is affecting me too. It wasn't your fault at all; it was mine," Kyuubi said as he continued to reassure Naruto with his embrace. "I will always love you. Nothing like this will ever be able to affect that. And none of it scarred either, see?" Naruto looked to where he had sliced him before, and found that he told the truth.</p><p>"Just promise me that when you do slip up, you will do everything you can to make it up to me," Naruto said with a smile. "I don't want to be betrayed or hurt again Kyuu. I won't be able to take it. I need you Kyuubi; I need to be with you."</p><p>"I promise Naruto. I won't ever purposely betray you, and I'll happily accept any punishment you decide to give me if and when I do overstep my limits. You're precious to me Naruto; please understand that." Naruto finally crashed their lips together lovingly. It wasn't clumsy like the first time, and Kyuubi could feel the emotions running through it. He happily returned the kiss before separating at the sound of the door opening. He wiped away Naruto's tears before turning to greet Tsunade.</p><p>"Let's have a look Naruto," she said before unsealing a set of examination tools. "Kushina, could you find us a lamp? I need a good amount of light for this. Naruto, please thoroughly wash and dry your hands so that we don't get inaccurate results."</p><p>The woman ran upstairs and thirty seconds later brought back a reading light as Naruto and Tsunade sat down at a table. "Thank you," Tsunade said as she took Naruto's hand and turned it upside down. Tsunade took out a q-tip and swabbed as close to the base of the inside of Naruto's thumbnail as she could.</p><p>Tsunade brought along a cut of raw fish to absorb Naruto's poison should it arise. She had used a marker to make ten separate sections, one for each test. Tsunade rubbed this q-tip against section 1-A and then discarded it. She then moved on with the other four of Naruto's nails. "I have to wait a good five minutes before I can be sure," Tsunade told them. "It may take a while to show effects, even on a microscopic level because of how immature Naruto's body is. Meanwhile, let's move on to trying to actually release the poison on purpose."</p><p>"I think I have a basic idea on how to do it," Naruto began, "but I don't want to think about it." His eyes became dark, making Kyuubi look away in his own shame.</p><p>"I realize this Naruto, but we need to know for sure," Tsunade told him sympathetically. Naruto closed his eyes and began thinking about Kyuubi betraying him or hurting him, causing him to tear up and clench his teeth.</p><p>"Let me do the motion, otherwise it isn't the same," he told her. Naruto spread his fingers and swiped at the air. When he brought them back, Tsunade could see the fiery liquid that had worked its way up his claws. Naruto now allowed his tears to escape him, causing a stream to flow down his cheeks and off his chin onto the table.</p><p>"I'll take a sample from each finger," Tsunade said as she took another q-tip and swabbed the edge of Naruto's thumbnail. The cloth absorbed the poison, turning it black before it melted away. "That's one thing learned," Tsunade spoke up. "It's highly corrosive." She then used a metal instrument to collect the poison. The poison was successfully put on the fish meat, but the tip of the metal rod began bubbling and then cracked off.</p><p>"This stuff is surprisingly dangerous," Tsunade told them. The square labeled 1-B began darkening, and the smell of rot penetrated the air. "I hate to do this Naruto, but as fast as your poison kills off tissue, I need to collect it in a crystal phial, because metal is affected as well. Collect your five claws together and purposely release your poison into this," Tsunade told the blond as she held out the phial.</p><p>Naruto stuck the tips of his fingers at the entrance of the container and willed for his poison to drip down into it. After Tsunade had ten drops, she put a seal on the bottle and told Naruto to wash his hands thoroughly. "I'm sorry I had to make you do this. I'll have the exact structure of his poison in by tomorrow, but he isn't releasing it on accident, so getting scratched won't be a problem if he keeps his hands clean. Remember to clean them thoroughly after you use your poison Naruto," Tsunade ended before walking out the door and into the night back towards the village.</p><p>"Are you alright Naruto?" Kyuubi asked the boy as he sat down. The boy's eyes were dull, and his face was still wet from his tears. Naruto buried his face in the crook of Kyuu's shoulder and let himself to vent his feelings. "Just remember what I told you Naruto; I won't ever purposely betray you, and I will endure any punishment you deem fitting if I overstep any drawn lines."</p><p>"I just don't want to be alone," Naruto said quietly. Kushina was helpless in this situation, but she wanted to comfort her son somehow.</p><p>"You are never alone Naruto," she said, gaining the boy's full attention. "I will love you for all time, and I know that your friends will never turn away from you." Kushina leaned down and hugged her son tightly. She was heartbroken by his tears, but she knew her son needed her.</p><p>"Your hug… it reminds me of Dad," Naruto told her as he smiled in wonder. Kushina began crying openly too. "It makes me feel truly loved and protected. Thank you Mom." Naruto hugged her back tightly.</p><p>Kyuubi felt left out of the circle. Do my hugs make him feel protected? he asked himself. Or am I just not as special to him as his parents? He never knew his dad until Minato's ghost came from his swords, and he just now came to know his mother. I shouldn't be jealous, so why am I?</p><p>Kushina patted Naruto's back and rubbed his head before coming out of the hug. "You okay?" she asked. Naruto nodded before turning to a passive Kyuubi. "It's late; I'm heading up to bed." Kyuubi and Naruto went upstairs as well. They headed into their shared bedroom quietly before shutting the door.</p><p>"Naruto?" Kyuubi began. Naruto turned to him to listen. "I want to know, when I hug you, do you feel protected and loved, or is it just passion?" Naruto's expression dropped, and he looked away for a second.</p><p>"They do make me feel loved and protected, but it's just a bit different Kyuu," he said hesitantly. "I can't explain it, but… I just have a different bond with my parents. I never knew them until recently, so I just feel completely safe and cared about when I'm with them. I know you care a lot about me Kyuu, but I just feel accepted on a different level when I'm embraced by my parents."</p><p>"You were hated by humans for all of your life; I think I get it. Being embraced lovingly by humans gives you a sense of not being worthless, not being alone or as an outcast. Since you just became a demon, and since I was with you from the beginning, it doesn't seem quite as significant," the kitsune said with a smile. "You do have a strong bond with me, but knowing you are loved by the ones who gave birth to you, even when the village discriminated against you is one of your most precious pieces of knowledge. You do love me, but it's different than your love for your parents. You're so beautiful Naruto; you have no idea."</p><p>Kyuubi took Naruto's head in his hand before bringing the boy in for a kiss. A tear escaped Kyuubi's eye, and Naruto watched as it fell.</p><p>"Kyuu," was all he said before smiling and taking a kiss of his own. "I will never stop loving my parents, and I don't think I can stop loving you either, so never feel left out or less significant, because you aren't to me."</p><p>Kushina was listening in on their conversation and teared up at Naruto's words. She felt as though she finally had formed a permanent bond with her son, even though her presence was missed for seventeen years.</p><p>"I'm gonna take a bath, would you like to come with me?" Naruto asked. Kushina's face reddened as she heard that through her wall. Should I stop them? No, only if I hear things that I know I shouldn't. Naruto is smart, he just wants to be intimate is all, Kushina thought to herself. Although, I'm gonna need to soundproof these walls eventually if they do decide to go all the way.</p><p>"Are you sure you want me to?" Kyuubi asked skeptically as he smiled at his blond wolf. Naruto kissed him passionately again before saying,</p><p>"yes. I've seen you, and you've seen me. What's the point in hiding it? And I can always say no if you try anything."</p><p>"You really are a pervert like Kakashi and Jiraiya."</p><p>"Except…" the boy began with a devious grin. "I'm solely interested in you, not several porno books filled with naked women. And I don't make my hands crawl over every pretty girl I meet like Ero-Sennin. If I'm a pervert, then I'm a very minor one."</p><p>"Touché," Kyuubi said before kissing his blond deeply and taking him into the bathroom and shutting the door. "On three." Naruto and Kyuubi smiled and simply skipped the countdown and dispelled their clothes. "Kami," Kyuubi breathed before turning his attention to the tub. "It'll take a while to warm the water," he commented as he looked away from Naruto.</p><p>"Not a problem love," Naruto replied before creating a bunch of water with his own chakra. "My chakra should be enough." Naruto tossed a small fireball into the water, causing it to steam up. He tested the water with his hand. "Try for yourself; I'm heat resistant, remember?"</p><p>Kyuubi dipped his hand in to realize that the water was absolutely perfect, just like Naruto. He picked the blond up swiftly, taking him by surprise as the redhead carried him into the rather large round tub. Kyuubi kissed him lightly before placing Naruto into the water. Since he could now control his powers, Naruto didn't instantly freeze the whole thing. The water remained steaming hot.</p><p>Naruto could see Kyuubi's growing erection, but he could still control his own urges, a good sign. Kyuubi's erection was rather large in Naruto's opinion, so he was a tad shy. "Now remember Kyuu," Naruto teased as he tapped the man's nose. "No foul play." Kyuubi blushed and splashed Naruto lightly.</p><p>"And no purposeful teasing Naru-Kun," Kyuubi added. "Wet your hair; I know how to handle washing unruly long hair." Naruto smirked.</p><p>"My hair may have grown pretty long, but it isn't unruly." He looked down into his own reflection embarrassingly. "Oh fine." Naruto dipped himself completely below the water. The bath could better be described as a pool. It was four and a half feet deep for Pete's sake. "I might cut off an inch," Naruto said as he resurfaced. Kyuubi held a bottle of Naruto's honey-lemon shampoo in his hand.</p><p>"Now come over here so I can untangle and lather it," Kyuubi commanded. Naruto turned around and allowed Kyuubi to work. The fox's claws were perfect for getting out even the tightest of tangles, and Kyuubi was very gentle. It took about five minutes for him to finish his work, but the kitsune didn't complain. The water began to cool, so Naruto tossed a smaller ball of fire into the center of the pool, heating it up further than before. Kyuubi wasn't scalded, but this was almost too hot. "Not any hotter, or I'll get burnt, and we don't want that, do we Naru-Kun?" Kyuubi asked as he leaned over Naruto.</p><p>"Okay Kyuu-San, and thank you for the nickname. I like it," Naruto replied with a smile as he kissed his lover lightly. Kyuubi stood back up and examined Naruto's hair. No tangles remained. Kyuubi: 1, Tangles: 0. The fox demon then put a considerable amount of the shampoo into his hands and began to work it into Naruto's golden mane. "You're so gentle Kyuubi," Naruto said with a smile. "Thank you for doing this."</p><p>"It's no problem, and you're welcome Naruto." Kyuubi inhaled the sweet scent in the boy's hair deeply and sighed, making the blond blush. "Now you can rinse it out," Kyuubi said. Naruto dipped under and swam to the center of the pool. He came up swiftly, making his hair and water fly behind him. He was so beautiful and sexy right there. Kyuubi Jr. simply couldn't stay down. Naruto smirked at a blushing Kyuubi who tried to cover himself.</p><p>"It's fine as long as you don't try anything Kyuu," the blond said humorously. "Now it's your turn." Kyuubi went into the water and sat happily as Naruto used his own shampoo on Kyuubi. "You're hair is so short. There aren't too many tangles at all." Naruto was careful when taking out the snags in Kyuubi's hair, and he lathered the man as gently as he could. "Now rinse," he commanded.</p><p>When Kyuubi surfaced, Naruto quickly took his chance and stole a kiss from him while he was off-guard. He held Kyuubi's cheek and caressed it with one hand and held the fox's upper back with his other hand. Kyuubi closed his eyes as he began returning the kiss and taking Naruto's head in one hand. Kyuubi wasn't sure where the blond would allow him to be touched, so he kept his hands above the boy's waist.</p><p>"Thank you Kyuubi," Naruto said as his arm wrapped around the boy's chest. "You can be aroused and show restraint, even now. I know it's hard, but you have to earn it, and I have to be comfortable with it."</p><p>"Kami you're amazing," Kyuubi said before stealing another kiss. "Now we get to wash each other down." Naruto smiled as he went and got a washcloth and his lavender body soap. "Would you like to wash or be washed first?" Kyuubi asked with a smirk.</p><p>"Stand still so I can clean you up… grimy fox man," Naruto replied. Kyuubi really wasn't filthy, but he smelled for certain. Naruto got the cloth wet before rubbing some of the body soap into it. He started on Kyuubi's back and worked his way lower until he reached his well toned ass. "You can scrub that down yourself," Naruto said with a smirk. "That includes your front too."</p><p>Kyuubi blushed, but he truly did hope that Naruto could become comfortable with touching and being touched before Mating Season. Naruto finished scrubbing down the man's well-shaved legs before moving around to his front and scrubbing down Kyuubi's armpits, chest, stomach, and arms as he kissed him. Naruto accidentally got too close and rubbed up against Kyuubi's erection, eliciting a shiver and low moan from him. They both blushed, but Kyuubi wished he didn't have to be tortured so.</p><p>Naruto reacted unexpectedly to Kyuubi's moan, and his own erection started coming to the fold. No! he told himself. Show restraint; damn you. It became obvious that his efforts were in vain, and as Naruto finished scrubbing down Kyuubi, he found that he couldn't hope to hide it. His erection had grown considerably after being transformed the first time apparently. Kyuubi caught sight of it and then looked away so as to not be tempted.</p><p>"Well well," he began deviously. "It seems that even you fall victim to your hormones once in a while Naru-Kun." Kushina listened carefully, but she decided not to intervene yet. If Naruto cried out, she'd rush in. This could happen to any boy if he saw something he liked, so her presence was not yet required. This was just a part of being a male, and she knew it.</p><p>"Just rinse yourself off Kyuubi," Naruto said with a smirk. "I at least lasted longer than you." Kyuubi smiled and did as he was told. "You are quite sexy though," Naruto commented as the redhead came back up.</p><p>"And you as well," Kyuubi replied. "You have very strong-looking and well-toned muscles. They aren't bulky, so your figure itself comes through. I like that." Naruto blushed, but he could say the same thing about Kyuubi. Kyuubi came over and held Naruto by his back. "This is what I meant about both sexes being appealing in their own ways. A male's beauty can be partially measured by his muscles. Yours are perfect… from your arms and legs to your chest and abs, you are delicious, irresistible." Kyuubi kissed Naruto passionately, but he refused to invade with his tongue and break his promise.</p><p>"You are just as beautiful Kyuu-San if not more," Naruto replied when they came up for air. "And beyond your figure, you as a person are amazing. I love you Kyuu," he said before stealing another kiss. "Now you must scrub me down."</p><p>Kyuubi smiled and took the washcloth from the boy's hand. Naruto was being surprisingly open about this, but he had his limits, and Kyuubi watched for them. He massaged Naruto's back, causing the boy to sigh and close his eyes. "Amazing Kyuu," he said. Kyuubi continued down the boy's back until he neared the waste. "It's fine, but no lower than my waist." Kyuubi was stunned. At least he had earned more trust and made progress. Naruto shivered at the fox-man's touch, but he never told Kyuubi to stop.</p><p>"You're quite sensitive," Kyuubi whispered into the blond's ear. "Now for the front." Naruto turned around, his erection gone. "You truly are remarkable when it comes to restraint little man." Naruto smiled. Kyuubi followed Naruto's own actions and wiped down the boy's chest, stomach, arms, and legs before allowing him to rinse off. "I'll get another washcloth so that we can clean our respective areas," Kyuubi said before getting out of the tub. Kushina was relieved. The two were nearly done. She would be able to get to sleep soon.</p><p>Kyuubi came back with a second black washcloth and tossed it to Naruto. They both used some fresh soap and scrubbed down their butts and pubic areas before dipping under the water one last time. "Thank you Kyuubi for taking a bath with me," Naruto said after they resurfaced.</p><p>"You're quite welcome," he replied before the blond kissed him lovingly. "I hope you didn't feel uncomfortable at all." Naruto shook his head. "Just make sure to always tell me if I overstep it, because you are a lot more open than I thought you might be."</p><p>"You did fine Kyuu," Naruto told him. "I'm just not confident about being that intimate. I mean, those areas are personal in both our societies, no?" Kyuubi nodded. "We'll get there, just not right now. Shall we get some sleep?"</p><p>"I am a bit tired," Kyuubi said. Naruto dispelled all of the hot water before getting a single towel and drying himself and Kyuubi off except for their "areas." These they each did themselves. "Shall I dress?"</p><p>"Pants yes, but I think your abs are quite attractive," Naruto said before conjuring pajama pants for himself. Kyuubi followed his lead, and the two crawled closely together in Naruto's bed. Kushina finally fell asleep as the two silently nuzzled. Naruto allowed his hands to examine each little bump and curve in Kyuubi's abdominal muscles. They were strong, but cute as well. Kyuubi ran his own hands down Naruto's shoulders and arms as he kissed Naruto. He avoided the boy's breasts, but Kyuubi examined the boy's abs as well. "I love you Kyuu," Naruto said before they fell asleep in each other's arms.</p><p>"Goodnight, Naru-Kun," Kyuubi responded before dosing off.</p><p>Not two hours later, Naruto awoke to strange noises in the forest. He heard two voices, but could not place them. Out of curiosity, Naruto got out of the bed and silently went down the stairs and out the back door.</p><p>WARNING!!!!! FIRST YAOI: MALE/MALE SEX SCENE. DO NOT READ IF TOO YOUNG OR TOO UNCOMFORTABLE!</p><p>Naruto finally knew those voices. It was Sasuke and Kiba. Kiba was moaning, and Sasuke seemed to be laughing lightly. He used the Kikánugan's range to see what they were up to and was stunned by the scene. Kiba and Sasuke were both fully naked and erect, and they were hugging and kissing lustfully.</p><p>"Enjoying yourself Kiba?" Sasuke asked huskily. Kiba nodded as he panted heavily. Sasuke could certainly kiss for a long time without need of fresh air. "Shall I move on?"</p><p>"Hell Sasuke, do what you want," Kiba replied eagerly. Naruto was surprised and a bit frightened by what he saw next. Sasuke laid Kiba on his back and began leaving love marks on his collarbone and chest, but then he moved down to Kiba's member. Sasuke looked to Kiba for reassurance and received a nod in return. Naruto was shocked as Sasuke took the head of Kiba's fully erect cock into his mouth, eliciting a loud and pleasurable moan from Kiba. Naruto watched as Sasuke sucked at the flushed boy's wanting dick with a passion until he decided he wanted to move on.</p><p>"Do you want me in you Kiba?" Sasuke asked as he grabbed hold of the dog-boy's weeping member. Kiba arched into the touch and kissed Sasuke. "I'll take that as a yes. Slick up my fingers unless you want it to hurt." Naruto watched in awe as Kiba lustily licked and sucked on three of Sasuke's digits. His own erection was becoming prominent. So this is what he and Kyuubi would be doing the night Naruto decided he was ready.</p><p>Naruto's breathing hitched as Sasuke forced his index finger into Kiba's hole. The dog-boy moaned as Sasuke worked his finger in and out. The raven added his other two fingers and stretched the boy out quickly as he thrust the three in together. Kiba yelled when Sasuke hit that sweet bundle of nerves inside him.</p><p>"Do that again Sasuke, please," Kiba begged.</p><p>"I will, but this time with something far better," he replied. Naruto watched with curiosity as Sasuke lifted the dog-boy's legs onto his shoulders and placed his dick at Kiba's entrance. "Slowly or quickly?" he asked.</p><p>"Just get it over with," was Kiba's response. Sasuke gripped the dog-boy's hips and quickly buried himself to the hilt, tearing another yell from Kiba as he himself moaned aloud. Sasuke kissed Kiba lovingly this time and kissed away his tears as well before beginning to thrust in and out of Kiba. Every time, Kiba moaned. "Kami Sasuke, you're hitting it dead on." Sasuke took this as encouragement and began thrusting faster and harder, making Kiba yip every time their hips collided. "I'm gonna explode Sasuke," he half-yelled.</p><p>"Not without me," Sasuke replied before flipping Kiba onto all fours. He grabbed Kiba's weeping cock forcefully and began pumping in time with his thrusts, getting faster and more forceful. By now, Naruto's own length was at full attention. He couldn't pull his eyes from this. "Now cum with me Kiba," Sasuke yelled. He thrusted at his top speed and strength, tearing a scream from Kiba as the dog-boy's seed shot from him and into the grass.</p><p>"SASUKEEEEE!" Kiba yelled as his orgasm overtook him. He shook as Sasuke hit his prostate over and over again and his semen spilled from his dick into the grass.</p><p>"Kiba," Sasuke moaned as Kiba's walls squeezed around his cock mid-stroke, making him fill Kiba with his own seed. The two collapsed and fell asleep in the grass, still connected. Naruto was shocked and a bit afraid. But Kiba enjoyed it, didn't he? I'm not sure if I can do that with Kyuubi.</p><p>"This is why I said it scars people for life Naruto," the redhead spoke as he wrapped his arms around a now frightened blond. "That is sex. That is what I didn't want to force on you. We'll only do it if we both think you are emotionally ready for it. Trust me, you're physically ready. You have been since you were thirteen, but if you aren't emotionally ready, and you if don't do it with someone you trust, it can be terrifying to the point that you are afraid for the rest of your life. I know it is enjoyable, because I have many same-sex male partners for friends, and I have seen this myself and asked, but I won't ever force you Naruto." Kyuubi caressed the blond's cheek and ran his hand through his hair.</p><p>"It really must be amazing then, because I don't see it Kyuu," Naruto said. Kyuubi hugged him tightly as Naruto buried his face in the crook between Kyuubi's shoulder and neck. "It seems like it would be painful almost."</p><p>"The first time is slightly painful Naruto, and that Kiba kid chose quick entry, which is the more painful route, but it melts away into pleasure as your body adjusts to having another man's penis inside it," Kyuubi explained. "That is why the Uchiha prepped him somewhat with his fingers. If and when we actually do that Naruto, I would prepare you far better. The fingers are not anywhere near as large as an erection, but they can be manipulated to stretch the internal walls slowly. Normally that would have been about a five minute process, but the Uchiha barely used thirty seconds. That's why Kiba yelled at the quick penetration, he wasn't prepared enough."</p><p>"I hope you're right Kyuu, because I just don't see how," Naruto said as he teared up. Kyuubi rubbed the tears away as he stared into the Kikánugan. No doubt the boy was checking Kyuubi's mind to make sure it was the truth.</p><p>"Naruto, it will be my first time as well, so I wouldn't be anywhere near that rough either," Kyuubi said as they walked back into the mansion. "We don't have to actually have sex this Mating Season. It is meant to be a beautiful thing that is mutually agreed upon between partners, not something forced upon another for one's own pleasure. I won't ever push you into a corner, and I won't nag you for it. I'll take this relationship slowly, and I'll take having sex slowly too. You don't have to fear me Naruto, not ever."</p><p>They walked into Naruto's room and silently shut the door. "Kyuubi," Naruto began. "I want to be able to enjoy it with you, but was that all there is to sex, just animalistic thrusting?"</p><p>"Naruto, there are a hundred ways of having sex, and you only saw three: pumping, thrusting, and even some oral sex," Kyuubi told him. "There is something you humans call masturbation. We call it self-pleasure. I have done it to relieve myself during Mating Season."</p><p>"What is that exactly?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"I will have to show it to you, because explaining it is awkward and confusing," Kyuubi replied before dropping his pants. "You literally grab it and pump, rub, or touch it in any way that you find pleasurable." Naruto's eyes widened.</p><p>"And that actually feels good?" Kyuubi nodded. "That is what Sasuke was doing to Kiba while he was thrusting into him."</p><p>"It looks like I'll have to explain sex to you altogether," Kyuubi said as he pulled his pants back on. "When it is between two males, as you saw, the Seme, the one on top, thrusts his penis into the Uke, the one beneath him. While doing that, there are two things that will particularly make the Uke feel extreme pleasure. One is hitting the prostate or a particular bundle of nerves again and again. The other is pumping the member of the Uke. Doing them together will quickly bring about the Uke's climax or orgasm. You may have heard this as jerking off, fondling, what have you, but they are all the same thing. While the Seme can do this to the Uke during procreation, a child who has matured enough can do it on his own. This is something a male usually discovers around the age of fourteen, but you were immersed in your training to the point where there was no time for you to discover it. During Mating Seasons passed, I used this technique to relieve myself of sexual tension, but I was hoping that you would possibly be willing to have me as your lover during this upcoming one. If this is not the case, masturbating is a good way to keep a level head."</p><p>"Thanks Kyuu," Naruto said before crawling under the covers. "I'm not sure I will be ready eleven days from now, but I'm glad you explained all of this to me. Come on; lay down. You need your sleep too." Kyuubi got in bed and kissed Naruto lovingly before falling asleep again. Naruto loved the feeling of Kyuubi's warmth and protection and fell into a blissful sleep as well.</p><p><b>Author Notes: Well, how'd I do on this one? Seriously, this I want reviews for.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><B>Author Notes: I'm glad that some of you reviewed and are
enjoying the story so far. I honestly find this to be the better way
of getting to yaoi. It isn't senseless or forced, and there's
plot. What more could you want? Anyway, onto the story.</B></P><P><B>%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$################^^^^^^^^^^^^&&&&&&&&&&&&&</B></P><P><B>Uzumaki Mansion:</B> Kyuubi and Naruto had fallen asleep
shirtless, and they held each other close in their sleep, but Kyuubi
was covered in a cold sweat. Now he was the one having nightmares. In
his dream, he had completely lost control and taken Naruto completely
against his will. It was horrifying to watch. Kyuubi had used several
suppression jutsu to keep the blond from running, but what made
Kyuubi squirm in disgust and horror was the fact that Naruto was
screaming and crying. As he finished, Kyuubi bit down on the junction
between the boy's neck and shoulder, drawing blood and tearing skin
as Naruto's wailing peaked.</P><P>Kyuubi dressed himself again, but several of Naruto's friends,
including his mother, broke down the door and rushed in to a
terrifying scene. With the smell of procreation in the air, Naruto
naked and covered in blood, and the boy's bonds, the cause was
obvious. They attacked Kyuubi, forcing him out the village gates.
What horrified Kyuubi beyond belief was the fact that he saw Madara
of all people carrying the unconscious wolf-boy.</P><P>"<I>You may have thwarted my original efforts,"</I> he began,
<I>"but with this much power, I'll be unstoppable. You should
have groveled at my feet and begged for forgiveness Kyuubi. Now I can
begin your punishment."</I></P><P>"Noo!" Kyuubi yelled as he shot awake. Naruto sprang up as well,
and Kushina came running. His breathing was heavy, and Kyuubi's
eyes were teary and bloodshot. When he caught sight of Naruto, he
hugged the boy tightly, almost hurting him from the squeezing force.</P><P>"What's wrong Kyuu?" Naruto asked through constricted wind
pipes. The kitsune didn't answer him for a while.</P><P>"I can't even begin to tell you Naruto," he replied. "My
worst fears unfolding in front of me, that's all. Madara was alive,
and he took you from the village. I was helpless. I love you Naruto,
that's all I need." Naruto rubbed his back reassuringly and
looked toward his mom with a concerned expression. "I love you
Naruto. I love you," he kept repeating.</P><P>"I love you too Kyuubi," the blond wolf responded. "I will
never stop caring about you." Naruto hugged the redhead back
reassuringly as he sobbed into Naruto's shoulder. "Just stay with
me Kyuubi. Madara is dead; you don't have to worry. No one will
take me from you or vice versa."</P><P>"Naruto?" Kushina called. "I'm making breakfast. When he
calms down, bring him downstairs." Naruto nodded.</P><P>"Shhh," he said quietly. "You're safe Kyuubi." Naruto
rested his head on top of Kyuubi's, and without knowing it, he
began releasing soothing pheromones into the air. "Everything's
okay Kyuu."</P><P>Kyuubi sniffled a couple of times before his body finally fell still.
"Your instincts and abilities never cease to amaze me Naruto,"
the redhead spoke quietly as Naruto rocked them both back and forth.
"You'd make an incredible parent. Thank you, Naruto." He got up
and wiped his tears away before Naruto took him in a loving kiss.</P><P>"I love you Kyuubi; let's go," Naruto said as he got up and out
of bed. He conjured a skin-tight red shirt for himself, and he put a
similar deep blue one on Kyuubi. "My present to you," he said
kindly. They walked barefoot down the stairs and into the kitchen.
"Smells delicious," the blue-eyed angel said aloud. "You're
making those pancakes again mom?"</P><P>"What? You don't want them?" Kushina teased threateningly.
Naruto was instantly sitting with perfect posture in his chair. <I>Okay,
it isn't just me; that woman has a talent for enforcing good
behavior,</I> Kyuubi thought to himself as he viewed the spread. The
familiar eggs were there, but now there was freshly baked bread.
There were no sausages, but this would certainly be a good meal.</P><P>"I really hope you can teach me how to cook Kushina-San," Kyuubi
told her as he took his seat. "Everything looks and smells so
good."</P><P>"I'd be happy to," she replied with a smile. "I've got six
blueberry pancakes for us." She walked over with the ambrosial food
and placed the platter down in the center of the table. "Two for
Kyuubi, two for you Naruto, and two for myself."</P><P>"May I begin eating mom?" the boy asked. Kushina smiled and
nodded, and Naruto dug in. "Aah, so juicy and warm," he commented
after taking three bites. They talked as they ate, so Kyuubi felt
better now that Kushina had basically accepted him into the family.</P><P>"At some point today," Kushina began, "Tsunade should bring us
the news as to your poison Naruto. Apart from that, we need to help
with the village repairs. The villagers are sad that their homes were
destroyed, but they don't seem to hate you anymore Naruto."</P><P>"I bet I could still find one person in the village who outright
hates me, but I don't care," the blond replied as he sat
blissfully in his chair, all of the flavors of the meal swimming
through him. "It is my fault that the village got wrecked, so I
hope that we can get passed this soon."</P><P>"We can use this as a way to distract ourselves during Mating
Season Naru-Kun," Kyuubi suggested. Kushina scowled inwardly, but
the nicknames were inevitable. "Including today, we have eleven
days left, so there is no rush. Kushina, has that white-haired man
yet gotten a repair crew? I don't know how long the repairs would
take, so I need to know."</P><P>"Kakashi-San was always one to forget, but I still don't have
access to Minato's money. Tsunade said it'll be another day
before the papers are processed," Kushina replied.</P><P>"I still have a thousand Ryou," Naruto told them. "If we get
financially tight, I can open up my frog."</P><P>"You shouldn't have to do that Naruto," his mother replied. "As
a kid, and you are until you are eighteen, you should be spending
your money on yourself and Kyuubi and your other friends. It's my
job as a mother to handle these things."</P><P>"Alright," the blond replied. "Kyuu and I'll get going if
there's anything you need to do." Naruto and Kyuubi washed their
plates and put them in the drying rack before grabbing their footwear
and leaving. Once they were beyond the view of the house, Naruto
pulled Kyuubi aside. "What was your dream about Kyuu?" he asked.
Kyuubi was terrified and didn't want to answer him, but Naruto
would have his answer with or without Kyuubi's consent. "You give
me no choice…Kikánugan." Kyuubi's eyes widened before he shut
them in a vain attempt to keep the boy out. Naruto froze in shock as
the dream played out in front of him, and Kyuubi was forced to watch
it as well, making the redhead collapse in shame.</P><P>"Naruto," he said quietly as he teared up. "I know I wouldn't
do that to you. No demon can actually lose his or her mind like that,
but it was so horrifyingly real. I…I…please don't make me watch
this again." Kyuubi crossed his arms and put his head between his
knees and stomach. Naruto leaned down and lifted his head. His
expression was passive, and he seemed to be more concerned with the
redhead than his terrible dream.</P><P>"Kyuu," Naruto said quietly before taking Kyuubi's face in his
right hand and kissing him. More tears escaped Kyuubi's eyes as the
wolf-boy helped him up. In the midst of their embrace, the presence
of an observing Konohamaru was missed. The boy was at first happy to
see his sensei up and about, but he was then immaturely grossed out
by the scene of two boys kissing.</P><P><I>Yuck. Since when does the boss like other guys? What about Sakura?
They've been kissing for a while now. Is this for real?</I>
Konohamaru asked himself. When he saw Naruto's open eyes, he was
stunned that they were now blue again. <I>They still have slits in
them. And that guy has red slitted eyes. Kami, that's the
Nine-Tailed Fox! Is he making Naruto do this? Yes, it has to
be…because Naruto-niichan only ever liked Sakura. I've gotta tell
the others.</I> Konohamaru crawled a ways silently before dashing
towards his own training grounds.</P><P>"You know why I haven't gotten mad Kyuu?" Naruto asked. Kyuubi
shook his head fearfully. "It's because you were crying and
shaking genuinely when you came out of that dream. You said you would
never purposely betray me, but you felt as though you had in your
dream, and you tried to make it up to me in real life. This is what I
want Kyuu. If and when you screw up, you admit it and repent; that's
all there is to it."</P><P>"You're so beautiful Naruto," Kyuubi said quietly as he began a
small smile. "I don't deserve your forgiveness though. I'd feel
less guilty if you would just give a punishment you think is fair."
Naruto was at a loss, but he began to think of something in his mind
that would work to end Kyuubi's guilt and keep Naruto from feeling
guilty about punishing the fox when he didn't think it was
necessary.</P><P>"As you wish," the boy began. "My punishment for you is that
you can't kiss me until we're either bathing tonight or in bed."
Kyuubi's expression dropped a bit, but he was still happy.</P><P>"Thank you Naru-Sama," Kyuubi said before beginning to walk down
the road. They continued on in silence until they reached the
village.</P><P>"I'm not kidding; I saw the boss kissing a redheaded dude with
red eyes," Konohamaru stammered to his teammates Udon and Moegi.
"Naruto had red eyes before, remember? His eyes are blue again, but
they've got slits in them. I think the Kyuubi has possessed him.
The boss never kissed guys before, except for that one time he
accidentally kissed Sasuke. My point is that I think Naruto's in
real trouble."</P><P>"And why would that be Konohamaru-Kun?" Ebisu-Sensei said from
behind the boy. Konohamaru turned with a grimace. He wasn't about
to spill it to this perverted teacher. "Out with it boy…" They
fought and argued until Ebisu took away his weapons and hung him by
his feet from a tree. As the nausea began to overtake Konohamaru, he
told Ebisu everything of what he had seen.</P><P>Ebisu blushed deep red, but he put his glasses back up before getting
the boy down. "This matter is very severe Konohamaru-Kun. I ask
that you stay out of it and let the village Jounin deal with this."</P><P>"No way," Konohamaru retorted. "If Naruto's in danger, then I
have to help. He taught me more than you ever could."</P><P>"I seriously doubt that, and this is out of your league," Ebisu
replied.</P><P>"Oh yeah, Rasengan!" Konohamaru yelled as he pushed the spinning
orb into Ebisu's back and sent him flying. "I bet you couldn't
'teach' me that in a hundred years. Let's go see the Hokage
guys," he spoke darkly. They all sped off toward the village in
search of Tsunade.</P><P>"That's all of the papers that I could find in that heap of
rubble," Naruto told Tsunade. "I'm pretty sure that the rest
were burnt or torn up or damaged when I got sent flying through your
office. Oh, by the way, did you finish examining my poison?"</P><P>"It's fine," Tsunade replied happily. "We've actually
recovered most of the legal documents and such, so I won't have to
do quite so much paperwork. Thank you for your efforts Kyuubi,
Naruto. And yes, I finished with your toxin. You can't even call it
a poison. It's so damn corrosive that it eats metal Naruto. Killing
organic matter is no problem for the red liquid that you produce.
It's an acidic and necrotic neurotoxin capable of bringing down a
bull elephant with a single drop diluted fifty times. Other than
that, I can't tell you anything because of how fast it is. If you
get any of it on a human, not just inside a person, it will burn away
the skin until it enters the bloodstream. If you don't clean the
wound like how you cleaned Kyuubi's the person won't live another
hour. Why don't you see what help you can offer around the market
with building repairs?"</P><P>"Alright Tsunade-Sama, and thank you," Naruto replied, gaining a
look of suspicion and surprise from the lady Hokage.</P><P>"Since when did you begin respecting me?" she asked. "What
happened to 'Granny?'"</P><P>"I guess I matured," Naruto replied before both he and Kyuubi
blurred from her sight. Konohamaru and his gang quickly came up to
her as he looked in the direction that Kyuubi and Naruto had left.
Tsunade looked up from her papers in slight curiosity and annoyance.</P><P>"What do you want Konohamaru?" she asked. The boy turned to her
with a serious and kind of frightened look on his face.</P><P>"Granny," he began in the same way as Naruto. "I saw Naruto and
that redhead before. I think he's the Kyuubi." <I>Of course he is
you dolt,</I> Tsunade thought to herself. Konohamaru leaned in closer
and whispered, "I think the Kyuubi possessed Naruto." Tsunade
kept on a serious look, but she laughed hysterically on the inside.
<I>Thank you morning entertainment,</I> she thought to herself. "The
thing is, I saw Naruto kissing him on the lips." Tsunade's
expression dropped. Damn Konohamaru and his curiosity and devotion to
Naruto. A couple of Chuunin had heard the boy, but they didn't show
it as they walked on by. "Naruto had a crush on Sakura; I'm not
dumb enough to miss that, and Naruto never liked guys that way last I
knew. And the only other time he kissed a guy was that accidental
time with Sasuke. The boss isn't himself, and that redheaded dude
is the reason." Tsunade had a terrified look on her face, but not
for the same reason.</P><P><I>Konohamaru, you'll reveal everything darn it,</I> she thought to
herself as the thirteen-year-old looked at her. "I'm gonna keep
an eye on him, but what if the Kyuubi attacks Hokage-Sama? Get some
ANBU together and find a way to get the two separated and capture the
Kyuubi." Konohamaru and his gang then walked off to the market,
planning out how they would get rid of the Kyuubi.</P><P><I>It's not like Konohamaru and his gang can do anything to Naruto
or Kyuubi. They'll learn soon enough,</I> Tsunade thought to
herself as she organized the papers into several stacks.</P><P>Naruto and Kyuubi sent shadow clones throughout the area asking what
everyone needed help with. It ranged from carrying heavy things to
actually helping rebuild structures. Konohamaru, Udon, and Moegi all
stayed out of sight.</P><P>"I taught you guys how to do Rasengan," Konohamaru began. "But
I think we'll need more than just one to bring the Kyuubi down. If
we all strike at once, I think it will be enough, but we need to make
sure we have a clear shot and it has to be when there aren't any
clones to mistake him for."</P><P>"And what if a Rasengan combination isn't enough Konohamaru?"
Moegi asked. "He killed many of our best ninja seventeen years ago;
he would probably kill us if he survived."</P><P>"It'll work. It has to work. The boss will be so happy when he
isn't under the fox's influence anymore," Konohamaru said
confidently. The group watched silently from a hiding place on a
roof. They had become very talented at hiding their presence, so none
of Naruto's or Kyuubi's clones took notice for three whole hours.
"Hey, they're heading into the woods," Konohamaru told his
teammates. "Let's go on ahead of them and set up." The three
went silently and quickly as Naruto and Kyuubi walked on.</P><P>"I'm glad that the village is getting back up so quickly,"
Naruto commented.</P><P>"It's all because of our help though," Kyuubi replied. "Well,
more yours than mine." Kyuubi was now craving to kiss the blond
wolf-boy, but he would remain true to his word and endure the
punishment Naruto had set up.</P><P>As the two came deep enough into the trees, Konohamaru gave the
signal for his team to attack. "Rasengan!" all three of them
yelled as they jumped at a surprised Kyuubi. They all made contact,
and Naruto jumped back a ways.</P><P>"Give us back the boss," Konohamaru yelled as he focused his
chakra harder. Kyuubi had on a look of surprise, and Naruto had a
look of fear on. "Rasengan Tri Attack!" Kyuubi became engulfed in
light for a second, but then the group's chakra faded. "No way.
It didn't even scratch him," Konohamaru said fearfully. He drew a
kunai and swiped at Kyuubi only to be stopped by Naruto holding him
by his scarf.</P><P>"What are you three doing Konohamaru?" he asked. Konohamaru
turned to see a completely emotionless face. "Why did you attack
Kyuubi with the jutsu I taught you?" he asked with a bit of anger,
making Konohamaru shrink back. Moegi and Udon watched in fright.
Kyuubi had not even moved yet.</P><P>"Wake up Naruto!" Konohamaru yelled. "Since when do you like
other boys? Think about it. You've been possessed." Naruto
quickly put his hand over Konohamaru's mouth.</P><P>"I know what's going on, and Tsunade kept this from you. Every
Genin team was brought out of Konoha in advance to Akatsuki's
attack," Naruto began. "I don't have the time to tell you
everything, but I'm a demon now." Konohamaru's eyes widened.
"I'm not what you think a demon is though. Let me show you."
Naruto threw Konohamaru into the air before changing into his wolf
form which towered above the trees. The boy landed on Naruto's
head.</P><P>"N-Naruto?" Konohamaru asked.</P><P>"I'm the king of the Bijuu now as the Ten-Tailed Wolf, and you
already figured out that Kyuubi is out. He was released after my
battle with Madara, and as you may have guessed, he hasn't
attacked. He's on our side Konohamaru. I know you won't
understand, but we're in love. Kyuu, come on out." The red-furred
fox appeared with a happy face on. "Konohamaru, Moegi, Udon, meet
Kyuubi."</P><P>"Whoa, hold the phone," Konohamaru began. "You fell in love
with Kyuubi, with a guy?"</P><P>"As I said," Naruto began in his new voice. "I don't expect
you to understand, but have Tsunade explain some things to you. Mom
is expecting me back soon, so I've got to go." Naruto put
Konohamaru in a tree before running off for his house without
changing back into a human. Kyuubi followed him in the same fashion.</P><P>"I know you told me not to kiss you," Kyuubi said aloud. "But
can I feel your fur while in human form please? Kushina and Sakura
both said it was super soft and warm."</P><P>"Um, okay," Naruto said as he slowed down and stopped. The
Uzumaki Mansion was in view, but it was a ways off. Kyuubi
transformed into his human form and rode on the wolf's back.</P><P>"They weren't kidding," Kyuu yelled as the wind rushed passed
him. "It keeps changing color, but it's so soft and smooth. I
kinda wish our bed was made of this."</P><P>"Don't even think about it," Naruto said as he went into his
human form, effectively dropping Kyuubi out of the air. "Come on;
I'm getting hungry for dinner." Kyuubi landed on his feet, which
were now sore from the impact. It was at least fifty feet down.
Naruto saw the lights on inside the house, and he saw people walking
around in the kitchen too. "Hmm, Mom's got company."</P><P>The two walked in to a very tense scene. Kushina was sitting at the
table with a terrified look on her face, and five ninja stood across
from her. They turned and smiled deviously at Naruto and Kyuubi.</P><P>"What's going on Mom?" Naruto asked. The five giggled and
turned towards him. Kushina remained motionless.</P><P>"Your mommy's stunned now that she knows you've been a bad boy
with the Kyuubi, little gay demon whore," the leader said. Naruto
was both shocked and enraged by their words. "Aw, the little <I>fag</I>
is hurt by this? Go ahead; tell her the truth. You sold your body to
the fox-demon so he wouldn't attack the village, didn't you?"
he accused the blond.</P><P>"If you value your skin being attached to your body, you'll leave
right now," Naruto said in a flat voice.</P><P>"No one cares what a gay slut like you says," the shortest one
scoffed. Naruto's blood boiled, and his eyes flashed red before
Naruto closed the distance between them and took the man by the neck.
Kyuubi put his arm on Naruto's and shook his head warningly.</P><P>"Peace between humans and demons my ass," another one scoffed.
Naruto's expression changed to one of shock. <I>No,</I> he thought
to himself before placing the one fearful man in his hand down on the
floor. "Humans can't live in peace with demons; it wouldn't be
right. All demons do is attack and, in this case, seduce humans. Why
should we leave you evil wretched things alone? Not only did you
betray our race by becoming a demon, but even chose to have sex with
a demon, a male demon no less."</P><P>"You will leave this house and never return," Naruto commanded.
His chakra was beginning to surge through the air as his anger rose.</P><P>"Just admit you're a faggot who sold his body to the demon and we
will," the leader said. Ten chakra tails suddenly appeared as
Naruto turned with the Kikánugan activated and his mark glowing red.
"Oh Kami."</P><P>"Leave!" Naruto roared in his demon voice. A white light flashed
from his eyes and the mark. When Kyuubi could finally reopen his
eyes, he saw Naruto crying, and the five men each had glowing eyes as
they walked out the door. Kushina had her eyes closed, but her lips
formed a small smile.</P><P>"I played the part of stunned mother, but I know you two didn't
do anything except kiss," Kushina said as she opened her eyes. "Are
you alright Naruto?" The boy shook his head. His mom leaned down
and hugged him tightly, but the empty feeling in him wouldn't go
away.</P><P>"This is why your hugs are so valuable to him Kushina-San,"
Kyuubi told her. "After being shunned by humans for so long, you
accepted him readily. That is very precious to him, and it is a bond
you must protect. He has the heart of a human, your heart, but he was
considered a demon long before a month ago. This is something that
only you can do for him, and that is that you can help him feel like
he is loved and not worthless."</P><P>"Oh Naruto," she said quietly. His chakra had stopped flowing
outward, and he was crying. Kushina began singing her lullaby to him,
and Naruto's crying began to cease. Kyuubi was brought to tears
however. He would never be able to be this close to Naruto, even as a
mate. Parental bonds, which Kyuubi lacked altogether, ran far deeper
than he could hope to see.</P><P>"This is why I wanted your relationship to be kept secret,"
Kushina told them. "If no one had found out for a long time, it
wouldn't have been as significant a revelation. Now look at what's
happened." Naruto was finally asleep in her arms. "I know in my
heart that you would never leave him Kyuubi, but Kami help you if you
do."</P><P>"It's okay mom," Naruto said as he blinked awake. "I just
can't believe how angry I was. I wasn't sad or disgusted by what
they said as much as I was afraid of my own rage." Kushina rubbed
his head lovingly, and she brushed her thumb over his forehead. When
she rubbed his mark though, he didn't moan or anything. "This
time, it made me feel reassured and loved," he said aloud.</P><P>"It's a theory, but I think that your mark can cause you to feel
a certain way depending on what a person wants you to feel when it is
touched," Kyuubi said aloud. "If it is just touched, it causes
pleasure. When Sakura touched it, you told me you felt tingly all
over. That was probably amazement and wonder mingled together. Now
when Kushina touched it, you probably felt warm and relieved a bit."
Naruto nodded his head.</P><P>"Let's eat dinner you guys," Kushina said trying to change the
mood. "I made spaghetti. This was Minato's favorite." Naruto
helped his mom prepare the plates, and the three sat down happily. "I
have to wonder though. Who saw you and ratted you out?" Kushina
asked.</P><P>"Konohamaru saw us kiss apparently, but who told those five I don't
know. He may have been in the middle of telling Udon and Moegi when
someone overheard him. It's not by any means impossible."</P><P>They continued eating until full, and then they washed the dishes.
Kushina bade the two goodnight before going into her own room. Naruto
dispelled his shirt before jumping into his own bed.</P><P>"Naruto?" Kyuubi began. "Are you really alright after that?"
The boy turned and looked up at Kyuubi.</P><P>"I don't know Kyuu," he replied. "I just need time to
reflect, and maybe one of these days I can meet some of your friends.
What I'm dreading is the entire village finding out, because then
I'll be a laughing stock."</P><P>"I wish I hadn't dragged you into this right before Mating Season
Naruto. I really do, but if you need me to leave for a while, just
say so. Your feelings and well being are important to me Naruto."
Kyuubi now sat next to the boy with a depressed look on. "If it
makes you feel better at all, we don't have to expose ourselves to
each other again. You have a love for this village Naruto, and you
have a love for me. As your friend and as your partner, I shouldn't
make you choose." Kyuubi was silenced by Naruto as he wrapped his
arm around Kyuubi's neck and pulled the fox on top of him.</P><P>"Love is what really matters, isn't it Kyuu?" the boy asked.</P><P>"I love you Naruto, and you love me, but if your love for me is
wrecking your life, I should go somewhere else until things quiet
down," Kyuubi replied. "In a relationship, love is what counts,
and it is my love for you that is making me ask. Do you want a chance
at being accepted by the village by me leaving, or would you leave
things to chance and have me stay through Mating Season?"</P><P>"Screw the villagers," Naruto said flatly. "It's my friends
and loved ones that I'm worried about, and that includes you
Kyuubi." Naruto turned the fox around and kissed him passionately.
Kushina was worried by some of what Naruto said, but she would find a
way to help him out. As his mother, this was her responsibility.</P><P>"If the village turns against you and me, I'll remind them of the
treaty we had all agreed to," Naruto told his kitsune. "For now,
let's just enjoy the time we can share." The boy connected their
lips once again, but this time, he licked Kyuubi's bottom lip
lightly as he kept his eyes open. His redhead looked back at him
questioningly. "I trust you Kyuu," was his response. They locked
lips and Kyuubi licked the wolf's bottom lip, asking politely for
entrance. Naruto obliged, and Kyuubi pressed the blond's tongue
with his own, inviting Naruto in for a battle of dominance. They
wrestled violently before breaking apart panting heavily. "Kami
Kyuu," Naruto began. "That was fun."</P><P>"You're not bad at all when it comes to kissing," Kyuubi
replied before nuzzling the boy and crashing their lips together
again. The redhead won dominance in the kiss, but he didn't simply
take free range of Naruto's mouth. They each got to spend time in
the other's cave. Kyuubi's fangs and Naruto's had cut the
other's tongue once, so iron became the main flavor. "We'll
have to be careful about that in the future," Kyuubi told him.</P><P>"I love you Kyuubi," Naruto told him before taking a final light
kiss from the man.</P><P>"I love you too, Naruto." They traced each other's bodies
lightly before falling asleep.</P><P>Over the course of another five days, the market had been rebuilt,
Konohamaru had been taught about what happened the days he was away
from the village, and the looks and whispers aimed at Naruto had
become more and more prominent. What was either better or worse,
Naruto went to bed feeling exhausted and flushed. He and Kyuubi were
about a week away from fully fledged heat, and there was just no way
that a repair crew was going to get to work on Naruto's other room.</P><P>"Kyuu?" Naruto asked as an uncomfortably itchy heat kept crawling
through him. Neither of them could sleep, so Kyuubi heard him.</P><P>"I know; I'm hot too. Try cooling down the room using your
chakra," he replied. They were both sweating above the covers, and
it was already passed midnight. "I don't care if you make it
thirty degrees in here. Just keep chilling it down until you're
comfortable. Heats don't affect me <I>as</I> much, so I'll be
fine even if I'm still a bit uncomfortable."</P><P>Naruto let his mark unleash the ability to cool the air, but making
it snow inside his own room was out of the question. Another hour
later, both of the boys realized it was useless. The air temperature
had dropped by ten degrees, but they were both still breathing
heavily and sweating. "I know this completely destroys the purpose
of not being tempted Naruto," Kyuubi said. "But the inevitable
truth is that our bodies know that we are near each other. I am
casting a jutsu on myself to keep my hormones in check, but… you
won't like this."</P><P>"Just tell me how to stop this," the blond moaned.</P><P>"Take off what remains of your clothing," Kyuubi replied. Naruto
was partially afraid of what this might do, but he was desperate.
"Control your urges as best you can, and I don't care if you have
to relieve yourself. Use the method I showed you if you must Naruto.
Since our bodies are after each other, we're gonna have to look at
each other to shut them up. Just keep your eyes from trailing south,
and you'll be fine. I'm gonna keep myself under control as best I
can, but Kushina will wake up if she hears us doing things. Don't
be afraid Naruto. You can trust me and your mother." They both
hesitantly dispelled their pants, leaving themselves fully exposed.
Both turned simultaneously with fearful eyes. Within seconds, their
discomfort began melting away.</P><P>"Thank heavens," Naruto breathed. They finally drifted off to
sleep at 1:30 in the morning. As tired as the two were, they slept in
until ten, making Kushina worry. She heard deep breathing from within
Naruto's room and began opening the door. Her face paled, and she
was shocked at the sight of both her son and Kyuubi exposed
completely. Kyuubi was awoken by her coming in, and he rubbed his
eyes.</P><P>"Oh Kami," he began. Kushina stared in horror. "We didn't do
anything Kushina; rest assured. This was highly unexpected, but
Naruto and I have begun experiencing our respective heats. What
frightens me is the fact that they're both so strong. We didn't
manage to fall asleep until passed midnight. Naruto tried to cool the
room down by using his chakra, but he didn't want to make it snow."</P><P>"After he dropped the temp by ten degrees, we both realized it was
pointless. Kushina, I hate to say it, but our bodies are calling to
each other so powerfully. Naruto and I had no choice but to strip
down and actually stare at each other to get our discomfort to quell.
I used a jutsu to hold down my hormones and arousal, but this is what
I would normally experience <I>during</I> the middle of Mating
Season. This won't work four days from now. Either I have to leave
the village for about a month, effectively leaving Naruto alone, or
he has to become secure enough with me and trust me enough to not
hurt him during procreation by then."</P><P>"Just clothe yourself Kyuubi," Kushina replied. "As long as I
know I didn't fail you two, I don't care that you have to sleep
naked. As per your options, it does look bleak Kyuubi. Naruto is
frightened by all of this. We both know that we can't force him,
but he would be depressed leaving you out in the wilderness. Kami,
what are we going to do?" Kyuubi yawned out of sleepiness.</P><P>"Hope for the best," Kyuubi sort of commanded. "I need to take
a shower. Carrying those bricks yesterday took more of my energy than
I thought it would. And along with last night, I've sweated a ton."
Kyuubi simply walked into Naruto's bathroom and shut the door.
Kushina looked back at her naked son. He was beginning to sweat, and
his body was becoming flushed.</P><P>Kyuubi wrapped a towel around himself and walked back into the room
once the familiar feeling came back. "It's happening to him too
isn't it?" he asked. Kushina nodded. "The Fates curse me. This
is about the worst possible situation," he said before sitting down
next to Naruto. "We've been bonded."</P><P>"You don't mean like you guys somehow took each other as mates do
you?" Kushina asked in terror.</P><P>"No, that would actually be almost better, because this wouldn't
be happening," Kyuubi replied. "When demons become bonded before
or during heat, they have to stay within a certain vicinity of each
other in order to basically remain sane and comfortable. In other
words, we're gonna have to shower, bathe, sleep, and basically
remain together all the time through Mating Season."</P><P>Kushina was terrified. "Naruto won't like this at all," she
said. Kyuubi shook his head. "And with the entire male population
in the village against you…Kami help you guys."</P><P>"I think I know where we can go that we will be happily welcomed,"
Naruto said as he got up. "Oh shit!" he said as he covered
himself with a pillow. Kushina giggled, and so did Kyuubi.</P><P>"Where would you go?" Kushina asked him curiously.</P><P>"We can pay a visit to Gaara and the Hidden Sand Village," Naruto
said cheerfully. Kushina wasn't very happy though.</P><P>"That's so far away Naruto-Kun," she complained. "You'd be
in the company of good friends, but I'd miss you for almost a whole
month. All of your friends would too."</P><P>"Unless you want to come with us to the Land of Spring Mom, I've
got no other options," the blond replied. "Jeez I'm sticky."</P><P>"We could stay until the day Mating Season begins, but passed that
would be almost dangerous Kushina-San," Kyuubi told them. "The
desert at night gets very cold, and we can more easily set up a
soundproofing jutsu in a stone building. In other words, the air
there would probably help us stay relieved of our heats, but if
Naruto decides he is ready, then we can fully soundproof our room so
as to not alert the entire village to our activities."</P><P>"If there really is no other way, then I guess I can only wish you
the best of luck," Kushina said with resignation in her voice. "You
both need a shower," she said as she held her nose. The boys didn't
actually find the smell to be obnoxious. They almost found it to be…
arousing.</P><P>"Alright," Kyuubi said as he yanked Naruto up by the arm. "We'll
be down in say twenty minutes at most." Naruto dropped his pillow,
making him blush as the two walked into the bathroom and shut the
door. Kyuubi put his towel down on the counter and turned on the cold
water.</P><P>Both boys could smell the other's arousal. Naruto's body was
reaching complete maturity. It was four months until his eighteenth
birthday, so his demon-influenced body began producing the pheromones
normally used to attract a mate, and they had Kyuubi hung. Naruto was
also being affected by Kyuubi's smell. It was musky, but so
profoundly attractive. Images ran freely through his mind, but he
refused to give in.</P><P>"I'm finding this difficult Kyuu," Naruto told him. Both of
their erections had come out, so they were in the same boat in
multiple ways. "If it's natural, then why are these thoughts so
strong to the point they actually have a slight hold over me?"</P><P>"It is the way of nature Naruto, and we demons are highly attuned
to nature, another way that humans abandoned," Kyuubi told him.
"Come on; the sooner we get through with this shower, the sooner we
can dress and go about our business." Naruto stepped hesitantly
into his cold shower. The waters were very soothing to his flushed
skin. "I could only find one washcloth Naruto," the redhead told
him as he stepped in and closed the door. "Let me get your hair
done real quick." Naruto and Kyuubi each did the other's hair
carefully, but now came the slight problem.</P><P>"I don't freaking care Kyuu; just hurry when you're in that
area," Naruto said with tears in his eyes.</P><P>"Naruto, you're afraid," Kyuubi said. "Naruto, don't force
yourself. That's the whole point of me being careful, so as to not
traumatize you. Really Naruto, if you're that afraid of losing it
because I touch you there, then wash yourself, please."</P><P>"I just don't want to offend you, but I'm so unsure of myself.
I…I…" Naruto told him. Kyuubi caught the boy as his knees gave
out. So much fear was coursing through the boy, and Kyuubi could feel
it. He was afraid to try, but he wished deep within himself to make
Naruto feel safe as he traced his thumb over the snowflake mark on
the young man's head. "Kyuubi," he breathed. "Dad." Kyuubi
was overjoyed that he had done it. Naruto had mentioned his father,
so he had to be feeling better and protected.</P><P>Kyuubi looked into Naruto's eyes. Fear still existed, but the boy's
nerves had been calmed as much as was possible now. "Naruto," the
redhead began. "Just remember the promises I made you, and think
about how much we've both been able to restrain ourselves. I'll
be quick around your pubic area and your rear, so you don't have to
worry." Naruto nodded and allowed Kyuubi free range as he smiled
lightly at the man. He bit his lip when Kyuubi had gotten down there,
and rightly so. Naruto was very sensitive, and Kyuubi sensed it as he
scrubbed the blond fur. Naruto shivered and shook, but he kept a
level head. "This is a side effect of Mating Season. You're
entire body is oversensitive. I'm done with the front though."
Kyuubi didn't have to take much time scrubbing the blond's
behind, and he finished the boy's legs as well. "Rinse off now,"
Kyuubi told him. "You don't have to wash me if…"</P><P>Naruto held the fox closely and kissed him passionately without using
his tongue. "Thank you Kyuubi," he said softly. "This proves it
entirely. I know I can trust you, so now I just need to conquer my
own fear." The kitsune was overjoyed in his mind, and he kissed
Naruto back in the same fashion. "Give me that washcloth would
you?" he asked politely. Naruto scrubbed Kyuubi down to his waist,
and he now breathed deeply before working fresh soap into the cloth
and actually scrubbing down Kyuubi's pubic area. The man was amazed
that Naruto was able to go so far, but he was sensitive too and
shivered once in a while. Naruto quickly moved onto his tight butt
and washed his legs. "And now you rinse," he said with a sigh.
Kyuubi did as he was told before shutting the water off.</P><P>"Are you okay Naruto?" he asked concernedly.</P><P>"I still don't know if I can surrender myself comfortably, but
I'm not afraid of this," he replied. "Kyuubi, I can't even
begin to believe how we got this far." The redhead stopped him with
a kiss as he caressed the blond's cheek.</P><P>"Let's get dressed," Kyuubi told him after he separated from
the kiss. Both of them realized something amazing. Both of their
erections were completely gone. "You have enough talent for the
both of us little man," Kyuubi commented as he opened the door and
grabbed his towel. The two dried each other off with no problems,
reassuring Naruto.</P><P>"I think I'll bring back my old ninja suit," Naruto declared as
he conjured up the familiar orange and black coat. Black pants
followed it up along with his headband and shoes.</P><P>"I always did like you in those clothes," Kyuubi commented before
conjuring up a t-shirt and shorts. They kissed lovingly before going
downstairs to a frantic Kushina. "You don't have to make us a
giant meal every day Kushina-San," Kyuubi told her. "A simple
bowl of cereal and milk will suffice." Kushina turned to him with a
look that just seemed to ask "are you crazy?"</P><P>"Would that really be okay?" she asked skeptically. Both of the
boys nodded. "Okay then." They sat and talked and ate their
cereal quietly. "I suppose you need to make arrangements with
Tsunade and say good-bye to your friends Naruto, so I'll take care
of the dishes. You two use your speed and avoid the villagers as best
you can. Only stop to talk to friends."</P><P>"We'll come back and give you a good farewell later Mom, so wait
for us," Naruto replied as he went out the door with Kyuubi in tow.
Upon the outside of the door was a note attached with tape. After
Naruto read it halfway, he burned it with his own chakra. "Fuck
off," he said in annoyance.</P><P>"As I said, humans are raised to believe very different things from
demons Naruto," Kyuubi began. "While admittedly, more same-sex
couples are appearing, it will be many years before that prejudice is
erased."</P><P>"I think I should talk to Kiba before we go," Naruto told him.</P><P>"That is probably a very good idea." The two walked down the path
to the village. Naruto stopped and used his Kikánugan to search for
the dog-boy. What luck, he was training alone off in the woods.
Naruto and Kyuubi blurred away and were at the boy's training
grounds a minute later.</P><P>Naruto decided he would play with Kiba a bit and hid his presence
entirely. Kyuubi stopped his own chakra flow as well. Naruto got up
into a tree and lightly tossed a shuriken at Akamaru's feet. They
heard the spinning sound and jumped away long before it touched the
ground.</P><P>"Who's there?" Kiba asked confidently as he sniffed the air. He
couldn't pick up a scent, rattling his nerves a bit. Another
shuriken came at a slightly higher speed from behind him, but he
dodged this one with time to spare as well. "Who the Hell are you?"
Kiba called out. He closed his eyes and listened, but Naruto was
completely silent when he used wind chakra to make sure there was no
resistance to his quick movements. This time, three shuriken flew at
Kiba from different directions. He successfully dodged two, but
Naruto had to dash in and catch the third. He stopped directly beside
Kiba. "Naruto?!" he asked in a bit of amazement and anger. Kyuubi
then revealed himself as well.</P><P>"Your hearing is excellent Kiba," Naruto began with a smile. "I
kind of need to talk to you though, about something personal."</P><P>"And what would that be fox-boy?" Kiba asked. Fox-boy had been
the nickname Kiba came up with, but more because Naruto had whiskers
than he knew what the older villagers knew. That name existed long
before Kiba had the knowledge he had now.</P><P>"I happened to catch your show with Sasuke in the forest outside my
house about a week ago," Naruto began. Kiba's expression changed
to one of terror as his face blushed scarlet. He put his hand over
Naruto's mouth and stared at him threateningly.</P><P>"Don't go around saying that you idiot," he told Naruto
harshly. "Now, that can't be the only reason you wanted to talk,
so spill it."</P><P>"I do need the truth about this. Did you actually enjoy what Sasuke
did to you?" Naruto asked. Kiba blushed even darker.</P><P>"Why would you want to know that?" Kiba asked in humiliation.
Akamaru even showed signs of embarrassment.</P><P>"You really are dense Inuzuka boy," Kyuubi said aloud. "Since
you have a thing for Sasuke, you won't find this to be disgusting."
Kyuubi took Naruto into an unexpected kiss, making Naruto scowl.
Kyuubi had broken his rule, but it wasn't all bad, so he returned
it happily. Kiba's mouth dropped as his eyes widened.</P><P>"Oh Kami," he said aloud. "You and Kyuubi are…" this time
it was Naruto who covered his mouth. "So, how far have you two
gone?" Kiba asked deviously in a quiet voice.</P><P>"Bathing together and being able to sleep naked without losing
control," Naruto replied. Kiba looked confused.</P><P>"What, you completely expose yourself but avoid sex?" Kiba asked.
"Why?"</P><P>"Because humans and demons believe very different things, and love
before lust happens to be a core belief. This is why I'm asking you
about sex, because you were the Uke," Naruto replied with a sly
grin.</P><P>"Don't even think that makes me girly," Kiba warned. "But as
innocent and oblivious on this subject as you are, I'll enlighten
you. At first, the penetration kinda stings a bit, but by the end of
it, you'll be in ecstasy. Does that satisfy you Naruto?"</P><P>"Thanks Kiba," Naruto said with a genuine smile. "You actually
just helped me a lot."</P><P>"What, were you…afraid?" Naruto and Kyuubi blurred away in
mid-sentence, so he didn't get an answer. "You beat the daylights
out of me in the Chuunin Exams, but you're afraid to bottom in sex?
Well, I gotta admit that I was too at first, but Sasuke is so good."</P><P>Naruto saw each of his friends and told them he was leaving for the
Hidden Sand Village on a long mission and wouldn't be back for
about a month. He got the occasional mocking look from a passing
villager, but he ignored them and moved on to Tsunade.</P><P>"Thanks for letting me in so fast Tsunade-Sama," Naruto said as
he entered her makeshift office in Sakura's house. "I request
that your ANBU leave until I'm done talking with you." Tsunade
waved her hand, and all six of the cloaked agents stepped to the
other side of the street, but Naruto saw the listening device and
canceled it with his Lightning Chakra. "This is personal, so
solitude is necessary," Naruto told her.</P><P>"Kyuubi and I are already entering our heats, and you know what
happens to animals in heat." Tsunade's face drained of color.
Naruto was being so frank. Everything was out of whack about this
situation. "I'm sure you've heard the people whispering. Ever
male in this whole village gives me a dark or funny look, and I hear
all of their whispers. 'Look, it's the demon whore,' and 'isn't
he gay now?' My point is, Kyuubi and I have become stuck together
because we've been 'bonded.' Basically, we have to stay within
a certain amount of space if we can remain comfortable during the
day. And it only gets worse at night. Another four days from now, our
heats will fully emerge, and we are probably going to take that final
step."</P><P>Tsunade blushed, but she listened intently. "I need a favor
Tsunade-Sama. Please let me and Kyuubi go to the Hidden Sand Village
for the next month. All that everyone knows right now is that I was
seen kissing Kyuubi. Certainly you know what would happen if we
actually went at it and the entire village heard it. We need a more
peaceful place for right now. Please Tsunade-Sama?" Naruto asked
with begging eyes. Kyuubi stood in the corner watching the ANBU
outside.</P><P>"I have actually already made reservations with Gaara-Sama so that
you could go during Mating Season," Tsunade told him. "If you
want to go Naruto, you have my permission." Naruto hugged her
tightly, a completely beyond awkward experience.</P><P>"Oh thank you thank you thank you Tsunade-Sama," Naruto said
aloud. "Come on Kyuu, time to tell Mom good-bye." Kyuubi followed
him out the door. Tsunade stood stunned, but she let them go on by.</P><P>Naruto overheard the ANBU agents' rude whispers, so he used his
Speed Clone Technique to slice all of their masks in half without
seeming to have stopped walking with Kyuubi. All six stood still in
fear and shock.</P><P>"Nicely done Naruto," Kyuubi told him as they zipped back to the
mansion. Kushina had packed a small bundle of food for the two boys,
and she hugged them both lovingly before sending them on their way
with Naruto's swords.</P><P>"If you need your Dad's advice, use them," she said as Naruto
conjured a belt and attached them to it.</P><P>"Three weeks and five days from now, we'll be back Mom," Naruto
told her as he and Kyuubi blurred back through the village and out
the main gate. "I wonder how long it will take to get there,"
Naruto said aloud. They had reached the desert an hour later, and
both were panting from the long sprint. Something that came to their
immediate attention was the sandstorm.</P><P>"Don't tell me Shukaku already went against the agreement,"
Kyuubi whined. "As the king of the Bijuu, only you can discipline
him. I'd punch his lights out and then cover him in water. He hates
that."</P><P>Naruto faded in dust and plunged headlong into the buffeting sands.
"Shukaku!" he yelled in his demon voice. There was no response,
so Naruto turned into his wolf form and sent an air bullet into the
storm. When the explosion went off, the flying sands ceased, and the
Ichibi angrily stood in the middle of the desert.</P><P>"What do you want sir high and mighty?" the raccoon asked in
annoyance.</P><P>"I believe I made you all swear to keep peace between us and the
humans of each land," Naruto told him. "I don't care if you
live out here, but don't cause sandstorms that delay and endanger
humans."</P><P>"It's my desert; I'll do whatever I want," the tanuki replied
before raising the sands again. Naruto used the Kikánugan to see
through the sands, and he hit the sand demon hard, knocking him quite
a ways. Naruto then proceeded to use his water chakra on him as
Kyuubi suggested. "I hate you," Shukaku replied depressively.
"Hey… damn you Kyuubi!" he yelled as Naruto covered him in
water. "You know I have a fear of deep water. You're a jerk."</P><P>"Just shut up little cry baby," Naruto told him as he walked
towards the Hidden Sand Village which was now in sight. "By the
way, enjoy Mating Season," Naruto told him suggestively. "Because
Kyuubi and I'll be enjoying ours." Shukaku's jaw dropped, but
he didn't have time to ask the two about it before both of the
tailed-beasts ran off towards the Hidden Sand Village.</P><P>"You're as good as I was at torturing him," Kyuubi said in
praise. "He'll be without a mate this year though, because Orochi
is his mate."</P><P>"That isn't very fair, but that would be the fault of humans,"
Naruto replied. "He'll be going nuts about a week from now. I
wish we could help him."</P><P>At the border of the Hidden Sand Village, guards were stationed on
the wall. These were all ninja who had not seen the battle in the
Hidden Leaf, so when one spotted both giant demons running headlong
towards the village, he raised the alarm. "Two huge animals are
running straight at us from the desert," he yelled. "I can't
see them very well yet, but warn the Kazekage."</P><P>"Naruto…" Kyuubi began.</P><P>"I heard them," the wolf replied. "When we near the wall, just
go into human form and surrender yourself. Gaara saw my
transformation before, and he knows we are coming."</P><P>"It's the Nine-Tailed Fox!" a guard on the top tier yelled.
"And there is a giant wolf with ten tails alongside him!" All the
guards became scared, and Gaara was heading out from his office
toward the main gate.</P><P>Naruto and Kyuubi stopped about a half mile off and changed into
their human forms. They continued running toward the village gate,
but without using their top speed. "This should be interesting,"
Naruto commented. Not two-hundred feet from the entrance, the boys
were stopped by the numerous Sand Ninja in their path. All of them
had on a serious and frightful look. "I assume that you thought
we'd attack," Naruto began. Upon the end of his sentence,
numerous shuriken flew at them. Kyuubi and Naruto both set up
substitutions and took every hit before puffing away. "Excellent
aim, but you're all way too slow."</P><P>"How did they?" a terrified Chuunin asked.</P><P>"Enough; they're allies," Gaara called from up on his floating
sand. "I'd recognize Uzumaki Naruto any day, which means that you
are the infamous Kyuubi?" The redhead nodded. "Allow them into
the village. They are my honored guests for the next month." Naruto
and Kyuubi smiled. "Come on in guys," Gaara called with a small
smile as he floated back behind the wall. Both boys blurred into the
village, confounding all of the guards.</P><P>"If they had really wanted to attack, we'd be long dead," the
leader spoke. "Let us be thankful that Kazekage-Sama has such
powerful allies." Naruto hugged Gaara tightly, a now not so awkward
gesture.</P><P>"How have things been Gaara?" he asked cheerfully.</P><P>"I'm able to sleep," the redhead replied. The black circles
which used to surround his eyes were gone. "I'm also able to
think about other things than dealing with Shukaku now."</P><P>"Speaking of Shukaku," Naruto began in a more serious tone. "Have
you guys been having trade troubles or anything?"</P><P>"Yes, Shukaku has been conjuring a sandstorm for the last few days,
and it's blocked a bunch of trade routes."</P><P>"We took care of the psycho-tanuki," Kyuubi commented. "You
weren't there to witness it, but Naruto is the Juubi no Okami now.
And as the Ten-Tailed Wolf, he is the king of the Bijuu as well. So,
we dealt with Shukaku's anger management."</P><P>"Why thank you," Gaara said. "We lost a lot of our military in
the battle with Akatsuki, so we had no way of dealing with him. Now,
Tsunade told me you would need to stay here for three weeks. May I
ask why?"</P><P>Naruto blushed, but he gave the truthful answer. "We're staying
here because my village isn't happy with two demons getting it on
during Mating Season. Yes, Kyuubi and I kind of fell in love, and
it's another four days until we begin experiencing fully-fledged
heats."</P><P>"I understand Naruto-San," Gaara told him with a small smile. He
was blushing a bit though. "This is just a bit awkward I guess. I
did reserve you a room with a single large bed in it. You can find it
on the fourth floor of the Kage building. Just try to keep the noise
level down, especially if you're gonna…"</P><P>"We know," Naruto interjected. "And Kyuubi knows a
soundproofing jutsu." Gaara nodded before handing Kyuubi a bronze
key. "While we're here, Kyuubi and I are willing to help with
things around the village. After all, we should work for our peaceful
stay."</P><P>"The only thing I will ask for is your assistance in dealing with
Shukaku," Gaara replied. "The desert gets kind of cold at night,
so make sure you bundle up." Kyuubi and Naruto left his office and
went up to the roof.</P><P>"It's kind of dry for my taste," Kyuubi commented. "Let's
sit down and eat the lunch Kushina packed for us." Kyuubi undid the
bundle she had given him and found a salad, some bread, butter, and
some of the leftover spaghetti in a plastic container. Two metal
forks and knives were included as well.</P><P>"Mom always seems to know what I'm in the mood for," Naruto
commented. They each took a fork in hand and dipped into the noodles.
Kyuubi smiled as they fed each other a bite. Through his third eye,
Gaara observed the two silently out of curiosity. "I hope things
don't get too bad for us Kyuubi," Naruto began. "I can only
imagine walking back to the village to find everyone staring us down
and laughing."</P><P>Kyuubi shoved a fork-full of salad into the blond's mouth. "We'll
deal with that later if we have to," he replied. After Naruto
swallowed, Kyuubi took him in a light kiss, making Gaara blush a bit
as he stared out his window. Temari and Kankuro walked in to see
their brother in his familiar position.</P><P>"What's up Gaara?" Kankuro asked, startling the redhead to the
point he fell backwards out of his swivel chair. "Whoa, Gaara! Are
you okay?"</P><P>"A bit rattled and confused, but otherwise fine," the redhead
replied as he picked his hat back up.</P><P>"There was a big commotion at the gate earlier. What was that
about?" Temari asked. Gaara had to think of the best way to answer
her question without revealing everything about Naruto.</P><P>"Oh, that was Naruto and the Kyuubi arriving," Gaara replied
shyly. Kankuro and Temari both gawked. "Kyuubi was released shortly
after Madara fell, but he's on our side, or to be specific,
Naruto's side."</P><P>"Where are they now?" Kankuro asked.</P><P>"They are enjoying the solitude up on the roof as they take in the
sights of the village," Gaara began. "They had a long journey and
even dealt with Shukaku for us, so let them have some momentary peace
and quiet." His brother and sister nodded. Temari found Gaara to be
cute when he was like this. Sensitivity was not his strong suit for
fifteen years, and now that was about everything he had. After they
both left, Gaara remade his third eye and found himself watching a
very awkward scene.</P><P>"Kyuubi," Naruto giggled as the redhead felt over his abs. "Show
some restraint and wait until we're inside." Kyuubi began kissing
him, but Naruto pushed him away and gave him a warning look. "This
is how we got caught in Konoha. If we get caught out here, we'll
have nowhere else to go," Naruto said darkly. "Why don't we go
spar out in the desert where we'll have some peace?"</P><P>"Alright," Kyuubi said as he realized that he had nearly lost
control again. "You're gonna win though."</P><P>"What happened to your confidence in your jutsu?" Naruto asked as
they jumped from the roof, scaring the living daylights out of Gaara
as they passed his window. They landed easily on all fours,
frightening some of the villagers as they looked in awe. Kyuubi and
Naruto blurred away and out the gate, kicking up a bunch of sand as
they passed. "Sorry!" Naruto called back to the guards on the
lowest tier of the wall. When they were about a mile out, Naruto drew
two lines.</P><P>"Just go my little wolf," Kyuubi egged him. They both sprung out
with intense speed and began their taijutsu battle. The guards on the
wall were terrified by their strength, and they had to use their
binoculars to get a sense of the battle. Kyuubi had taken a solid
pinpoint strike to the shoulder, and Naruto had been hit in the gut.
"You alright?" Kyuubi asked as he held his left shoulder. Naruto
nodded. "Think fast." Kyuubi flew at him with a kick ready.
Naruto activated the Kikánugan and dodged Kyuubi's four part
attack. Naruto then nailed him in the back, sending Kyuubi about a
quarter mile into the desert.</P><P>"Oops," Naruto said aloud, but Kyuubi reappeared in his fox form
and sent a chakra beam at Naruto. "Holy…" Naruto used his top
speed to get out of the way before changing into his wolf form. The
black chakra beam created a crater in the sands and sent dust high
into the air with the explosion. All of the onlookers were awestruck,
including Gaara. The two canine titans ducked it out with claws and
teeth, but no major blows were used.</P><P>"So this is the power of the Bijuu," Gaara said quietly. "I can
see why Akatsuki was after them, but to think that they could fight
the Bijuu and jinchuuriki on even footing." Naruto and Kyuubi
collided chakra attacks, sending out a pressure wave. Naruto realized
that the village would be buried, so he used his top speed and
blocked the main wall as the air wave hit him along with the rising
sands. Naruto whimpered and reverted to his human form as Kyuubi
raced over.</P><P>"We definitely overdid it," the redhead commented as he picked
Naruto up. "He'll be a bit sore, but at least you guys weren't
buried alive."</P><P>"From now on," Naruto began, "we're sticking to taijutsu and
ninjutsu on human levels." Kyuubi nodded as he placed the boy back
on his feet. They had been brawling for several hours, so it was
already dinner time as the sun began setting. Gaara treated the two
to a feast in his hall to welcome them to the Hidden Sand Village.</P><P>"You guys may go to bed whenever you wish, but I'll be up doing
some paperwork for a couple of hours," Gaara told them as they
walked up the stairs. His office was on the second floor, and their
room was on the fourth. After Gaara entered his office, Kyuubi and
Naruto began feeling the effects of their heats. They looked out a
window to see that the sun was almost fully set.</P><P>"We need to hurry and soundproof our room before we start moaning
our discomfort," Kyuubi said seriously. They half-ran up the stairs
so as to not bump into anybody, but they were beginning to sweat.
When they got to the door to their room, Kyuubi pulled out the key.
His hand shook, but he steadied it with the other and unlocked the
oak door. He and Naruto rushed in, closed the door, and locked it.
"Okay, now to just make this room silent," Kyuubi said as he
flashed through about forty seals. A blue light filled the room and
flew into the walls and window.</P><P>"So we'll still be safe even if we start moaning in our sleep
Kyuubi?" Naruto asked as he dispelled his clothing.</P><P>"I developed this jutsu myself. If we blew up a firework in here,
no one would hear a thing," Kyuubi replied as he breathed heavily.
"The sun is set, so this should be the worst of it for now. Gaara
said that the desert got cold at night, so I'll open the window."</P><P>"What will happen if someone looks in here and sees us like this
Kyuu?" Naruto asked.</P><P>"You're right," the redhead replied with an angered look on. "I
can create a pretty strong illusion though. I'll make it seem like
we're clothed, separate, and that we're under the covers. I can
even make it seem like we are breathing mechanically." Kyuubi went
through another seventy seals before the illusion took its place in
the window.</P><P>"It's getting worse Kyuu," Naruto half-whined. Kyuubi was
noticing it too as he dispelled his clothes. The cold air was
helping, but Kyuubi's skin was crawling. This was pre-heat too,
which meant that they'd practically go nuts during the real thing.</P><P>"Just do what we did last night," Kyuubi told him. He laid down
and looked into Naruto's eyes, but the feeling wouldn't
completely disappear. <I>Damn,</I> he thought in his mind. <I>I'm
not taking him against his will, not even if it relieves him.</I>
Kyuubi kept telling himself sternly to restrain himself.</P><P>"This is getting bad Kyuubi," Naruto said aloud. "My instincts
are screaming at me, and my body is trying to act on them."</P><P>"I remember my first heat," Kyuubi began. "You feel like you
will be torn apart, and you can barely think straight, right?"
Naruto nodded. "I want to help you Naruto, but we've only got a
couple of options. One is that we can fully procreate, which is a
definite end. The other is that we can hold each other closely and
keep our arousal in check."</P><P>"Oh Kyuu," Naruto said as a tear came to his eye. He was shaking,
and his arms twitched. Naruto was in real pain at this, but Kyuubi
could feel his fear. The redhead snuggled up closer to the blond and
held his head lovingly.</P><P>"You aren't ready; I know," Kyuubi said. "Just hang on to me
and trust me Naru-Kun." Naruto did as he was told, and he wished in
his mind for this to just end. Kyuubi took his lips in a soft kiss
and caressed his mark, leaving Naruto feeling numb. The itchy hotness
was blown away, and the oversensitivity disappeared as well. Naruto
wrapped his arms around Kyuubi's neck and held the man close.</P><P>"Thank you Kyuubi," Naruto said as he peacefully fell asleep. The
redhead stroked his hair and hummed what he remembered from Kushina's
lullaby as his eyes became heavy with sleep as well.</P><P>Gaara was blushing crimson after seeing this. "I wanted to know
what exactly was going on, but…" he began. "They really are in
love, and Naruto's not much of a kid anymore." The Kazekage
shivered as he dispelled his third eye. "At least I know Kyuubi
loves him back. Invading privacy is wrong, but not when it's for
the purpose of protecting friends is it?" he asked into the air.</P><P>"Naruto and the Kyuubi are in love?" Temari asked from his
doorway. Gaara turned in terror. His door was too silent when it
opened. His sister wore a surprised look, and Kankuro looked shocked
and confused. "I never would have taken that runt to be gay."</P><P>"Don't you dare insult him Temari-Neesan," Gaara said in his
old dark voice. The girl and Kankuro were both struck with fear. "I
don't think I could fall in love with Shukaku, but Kyuubi is at
least sane. And Naruto is the symbol of the Great Alliance of
Nations."</P><P>"That's just…weird though," Kankuro began.</P><P>"I honestly find it to be kind of fitting," Temari said with a
smile. "He was a complete idiot in thinking Shikamaru and I were
going out, and he had no experience in the love department. He also
wasn't a complete pervert like his teachers, so I find this cute
and romantic even."</P><P>"Would you like to see Temari?" Gaara asked. "You'd find this
to be interesting." Temari wasn't sure what she'd see, so she
let Gaara connect her to his Third Eye Technique. When the image
became perfectly clear, Temari gasped at the sight of both of the
rather handsome, young, naked men embracing in their sleep.</P><P>"I wouldn't have thought that guy could actually look all that
great," she commented with a look of approval. "They're cute
together." Gaara finally cut her off, and she was disappointed.</P><P>"She-pervert," Kankuro said aloud. "Two naked men in bed, and
you find that cute?" Temari blushed and turned to him angrily. "I'm
just saying that you're a bit too interested in naked guys being
together."</P><P>"Apparently, Naruto and the Kyuubi are beginning to experience
their heats," Gaara told them. Both Temari and Kankuro looked
skeptical. "You noticed his blue slitted eyes during dinner right?"
Kankuro and Temari nodded. "Naruto's the king of the
Tailed-Demons now, after he fought Madara. He is a demon now."</P><P>"No joke?" Kankuro asked. Gaara nodded silently. "I heard he's
trying to establish peace between humans and demons, but is this
necessary, to actually immerse himself in their world?"</P><P>"That isn't why he's with Kyuubi you dolt," Temari scolded as
she hit him in the back of the head. "They actually fell in love
and might become mates within the next month. Naruto and Gaara lived
lives of fear and rejection, but Naruto was way worse off. He
understands more about this than we do, so let it go."</P><P>"From what Tsunade and Shukaku both told me, demons don't even
make the distinction between homosexuality and opposite-sex
relationships," Gaara began. Both of his siblings looked back at
him in awe. "Gay isn't even a word to them. Demons and humans
have differing beliefs about sexuality, and so what they are doing is
perfectly acceptable and natural to the demon world."</P><P>"Isn't it kind of pointless for two guys to be lifelong partners
though?" Kankuro asked.</P><P>"If you mean in producing offspring, you are sadly mistaken,"
Gaara told him flatly. "I'll let you both in on a big secret: two
same-sex demons can produce children with each other." His siblings
fell back into chairs with pale faces. "This is just their natural
heats affecting their bodies, but they love each other. Naruto is
after love, and Kyuubi loves him back, and what's more is that they
are trying to avoid engaging in sexual activity until Naruto can
conquer his fears."</P><P>"Aww, how romantic," Temari commented, making Kankuro raise an
eyebrow. "They'll make a great couple."</P><P>"Keep telling yourself that," Kankuro scoffed. Temari slammed her
fist into his cheek painfully.</P><P>"You are such an idiot," she yelled. "Kyuubi isn't forcing
him. That means this isn't just a physical and lustful temporary
relationship. They are both waiting until they are ready, and Kyuubi
is helping Naruto through his first heat while restraining himself.
That is what it means to be a devoted partner. This is why you don't
have a girlfriend Kankuro; you're not sensitive at all to these
things."</P><P>"Well excuse me for not being gay or a girl," Kankuro retorted
before receiving another deathblow from his sister. "Hey, that
hurts Temari."</P><P>"Go to bed, both of you," Gaara said in annoyance. "I actually
do have to get this paperwork done before morning." Temari pulled
Kankuro by his shirt out of Gaara's office and shut the door. "That
was close; they might have noticed I was beginning to sweat. Naruto,
I never would have guessed you'd be so emotional."</P><P>"Kyuu, my body won't…" the blond said as his eyes kept
changing brightness. They would begin glowing light red, but Naruto
kept forcing himself under control. "Kami help me!" he yelled.</P><P>"Naruto, keep calm," Kyuubi told him. "This is a surge,
something I forgot to tell you about. It seems that we are cursed
with a full moon, and that means your sanity is even more weakened by
your heat. Your instincts are trying to temporarily take over to
relieve you."</P><P>"Kyuu, it hurts," Naruto cried out as his mark began glowing. He
collapsed into the bed as his chakra began forming tails.</P><P>"No, not here," Kyuubi yelled as he threw his hand out to
Naruto's mark. "I won't let you lose control Naruto."
Kyuubi's skin began burning, but he reached Naruto's mark and
rubbed it in an attempt to calm Naruto down. Naruto's chakra
stopped surging from him and receded, but his eyes still glowed red
partially as he looked back at Kyuubi.</P><P>"Damn," Kyuubi growled. "My hand." Kyuubi had to stop rubbing
Naruto's mark reassuringly long enough to heal his chakra burns.
"Are you okay Naruto?" The blond was crying silently as his eyes
kept fluctuating. "Oh Naruto," Kyuubi spoke as he teared up and
hugged his beloved closely. "We can't let this keep going Naruto;
you're losing your mind. Do you trust me Naruto?"</P><P>"I love you Kyuubi," Naruto whispered as he kissed the redhead
while tears streamed from his eyes. "We're out of options aren't
we?" Kyuubi looked at him concernedly. "I have no regrets about
my decision Kyuu," Naruto told him before lying back and baring his
neck.</P><P>"Naruto," Kyuubi spoke softly in amazement. "I won't betray
your trust; I can still feel the fear emanating from your body. I
couldn't take you like this."</P><P>"I'm more afraid of losing my mind than I am of you Kyuubi,"
Naruto replied softly. This was so pure. Naruto was trusting Kyuubi
with his body and his life, and he asked in the most amazing way. He
trusted his instincts and bared his neck, the deepest way to show
both trust and show surrender. "You won't hurt me; I know it, but
this curling heat and these overwhelming thoughts are making me lose
my mind. Please Kyuu, I love you; I trust you. I'm not afraid
anymore."</P><P>"Oh Naruto," Kyuubi said as he cried and took the blond in his
arms and into a loving kiss. Naruto was an innocent and tortured
angel sitting in front of him asking for the deepest form of love,
Kyuubi's devotion and protection. "If it feels wrong, if it feels
like you shouldn't do this, tell me the second you feel that way
Naruto."</P><P>"Kyaa-aaa!" Naruto yelled as his eyes flashed dark red for a
second. He curled into a ball and held his stomach, and his body
tightened, causing intense pain. Kyuubi grabbed from inside a drawer
in a nightstand a small phial of herbal oils he had requested from
Tsunade rather embarrassingly.</P><P>Kyuubi slicked up three of his fingers as he turned Naruto onto his
back. His partner's touch brought Naruto's body out of its
hysterical behavior. "This'll feel a bit weird and might sting a
little, but I need to make sure you are prepped Naru-Kun," Kyuubi
told him before spreading the blond's legs. Kyuubi's razor nails
retracted before he pressed his index finger into the young man's
tight ring of muscle. Naruto grimaced, but it didn't hurt really.
"Relax Naruto, or it will really hurt later," Kyuubi told him
before rubbing Naruto's mark reassuringly.</P><P>"Kyuubi," he breathed as his eyes returned to their normal shade
of cerulean blue. Naruto's body fully relaxed under Kyuubi's
loving touch, but the wolf-boy still smelled of anxiety and worry.
Kyuubi hesitantly put in a second finger, which did stretch Naruto a
bit. "Ah," he clenched. <B>(This is meant to be like ack, but
without the c,k.)</B></P><P>"Are you okay?" Kyuubi asked him. Naruto nodded in return, but
his completely numb expression worried Kyuubi. The redhead began a
scissoring motion and slowly stretched out Naruto's insides. Naruto
moaned lowly in his throat at the weird but slightly pleasurable
feeling. This went on for about two minutes before Kyuubi inserted
his third and final finger. Naruto's eyes widened a bit, and the
boy bit down on his bottom lip a bit, but he signaled for Kyuubi to
go on. "Don't force yourself if you aren't one-hundred percent
sure Naruto, please," Kyuubi requested in a serious tone as he took
a light kiss from his blond lover.</P><P>"I trust you Kyuubi," was all that Naruto said as he fought
against his instincts. "I love you." Kyuubi kept expanding his
motions bit by bit, and he suddenly brushed Naruto's prostate,
making the boy shake and give a soft whine of pleasure. "Amazing,"
Naruto sighed. Kyuubi thrusted against this point softly three more
times, receiving a similarly strong reaction each time.</P><P>"I love you Naruto," Kyuubi said as he finished preparing the
wolf-boy. Naruto moaned at the loss as Kyuubi drew his fingers out
slowly. The kitsune caressed his cheek lovingly, not knowing whether
or not Naruto was really ready for this. "You have to be completely
relaxed for this, so let me indulge you first."</P><P>Naruto picked his head up a bit before Kyuubi took him into a deep
kiss. The man politely asked with his tongue for entrance, and Naruto
obliged. Kyuubi traced the inside of Naruto's mouth and took hold
of the boy's waist. The redhead ground their now rock-hard
erections together softly, eliciting a moan from Naruto as he arched
into the touch.</P><P>"Kyuubi," he sighed. Memories of the first time began haunting
him, but Naruto dismissed them knowing that Kyuubi had complete
control of himself. They continued rocking back and forth like this
for several minutes until Kyuubi broke their fourth kiss and began
tracing his hands over Naruto's muscles. He leaned down to Naruto's
neck and licked reassuringly, giving Naruto an odd and profound
sensation.</P><P>After Kyuubi finished with the boy's neck, he moved down to
Naruto's personal and in Kyuubi's opinion, <B>sacred</B> area. He
licked the tip of Naruto's erection, tearing a lustful and
pleasurable moan from the boy. The smell of fear was melting away,
and Kyuubi became more confident. He commanded his fangs to retract
and then slowly took Naruto into his mouth, sending waves of
unbelievable pleasure wracking through him. "Kami Kyuubi," Naruto
moaned loudly as his hand reached down and stroked the fox's hair.
Kyuubi lightly sucked and licked Naruto until the boy's moans
became dangerously loud, signaling his approach to his climax.</P><P>"Are you ready Naruto?" Kyuubi asked him as he rubbed the boy's
cheek.</P><P>"I'm ready…Kyuubi," Naruto told him. No fear resided in his
eyes, but Kyuubi felt the power of Naruto's instincts. He was
fighting them hard, and Kyuubi would finish them off for good.</P><P>"I'll go slow," Kyuubi told him as he put more of the herbal
oil onto his own erection. He made sure that there was an even coat
on the entire shaft before placing the tip at Naruto's entrance.
"You know something?" Kyuubi asked. "We're the same size."
Naruto giggled, but he cringed as Kyuubi pressed in lightly. "You
have to relax Naruto," Kyuubi told him as he stopped. "I'll
help you." Kyuubi lightly took hold of Naruto's manhood and
pumped it slowly and gently, causing a soothing pleasure to work its
way into Naruto's system.</P><P>When Kyuubi felt Naruto's inner walls loosen at last, he began
pressing in again. Naruto's body resisted somewhat, but Kyuubi had
patience to spare. Anything for Naruto's love and trust. The
redhead stroked and kissed Naruto lovingly as he continued burying
himself. Gaara was stunned beyond all possible limits as he watched
through his third eye on the ceiling.</P><P>After burying himself to the hilt, Kyuubi broke their kiss and smiled
at Naruto. "Are you still completely okay?" he asked. Naruto
nodded and smiled before taking Kyuubi into a kiss that he controlled
himself. The feeling of being filled was weird, and Naruto's body
still wasn't completely used to it, so Kyuubi hugged him and
nuzzled the boy until Naruto signaled that he should move on.</P><P>"I won't be rough," Kyuubi said quietly before lifting Naruto's
legs onto his shoulders and drawing himself out slowly. When he was
halfway out, Kyuubi began pressing back in at an angle, pressing into
and around Naruto's prostate.</P><P>"Kyuubi, this is so…" Naruto began. But there were no words to
describe this. This was bliss, ecstasy; this was love in its purest
form. Lust still didn't play a role at all, and both of them wanted
it to remain that way for the remainder of their lovemaking. Every
single time he thrust back in, Kyuubi hit Naruto's prostate gently.
This continued for a while until Kyuubi increased his speed just a
little. Both boys were nearing orgasm, and they could sense each
other's feelings so well. "Kyuu, I'm gonna…"</P><P>"Me too, but we are going to finish together," the redhead
replied softly as he took hold of Naruto's manhood again and
stroked him more fervently. Naruto moaned Kyuubi's name, and they
kissed deeply as Kyuubi sped up and matched rhythms. As they
separated for air, Naruto was finally taken over the edge and into
his climax.</P><P>"Kyuu," he moaned more loudly than all of the other times.
Naruto's first seed spilled forth onto both of their stomachs as he
shook from the intense feeling of his first orgasm surging through
him, shocking Gaara as he continued to watch.</P><P>Naruto's internal walls clenched down on Kyuubi's cock, and after
two more strokes into Naruto's orgasm, he came as well, filling
Naruto's insides with his semen. "Naruto," he moaned quietly as
he continued thrusting into and pumping Naruto. They rode out the
remainder of their orgasms in bliss, and both boys finally collapsed,
Kyuubi on top of Naruto, still connected.</P><P>"Did you enjoy losing your virginity?" Kyuubi asked the blond as
they both panted and stared at each other in a profound happiness.</P><P>"I love you Kyuubi; I always will," Naruto said before hugging
Kyuubi and kissing him lovingly and deeply. Kyuubi was overjoyed. He
had successfully helped Naruto through probably the toughest part of
becoming a demon and had solidified a position as Naruto's lover
for all of Mating Season. This was both of their first times
experiencing true sex as well, so the trust built was undeniable.
Nothing could be more perfect, because Naruto was no longer afraid,
and he enjoyed making love with Kyuubi. "I have one condition
though," Naruto panted as they broke apart for air.</P><P>"Anything Naruto; you deserve it for doing so well on both of our
first times," Kyuubi replied instantly.</P><P>"Next time…you're the Uke," Naruto said suggestively. Kyuubi
smiled and giggled, but it was because he found this to be cute.</P><P>"Of course my lovely wolf," Kyuu replied as he kissed Naruto one
final time and held his head as they fell into the blissful embrace
of sleep, still connected from their activities.</P><P>"Kami, that was amazing," Gaara commented as he closed his third
eye connections.</P><P>"That's impressive for their first times. I wish I had a
boyfriend like Kyuubi," Temari commented. She had used a shadow
clone to drag Kankuro out, so she got to watch the whole show as
well. "But you're bad for watching them without their consent
Gaara-Kun."</P><P>"And what's your excuse?" the redhead asked her in return. "We
both watched, and we both enjoyed it for our own reasons. I'm
really happy that Naruto found true love, but I kind of wish I had
been who he loved that much."</P><P>"Aww, this is what I love about you Gaara," Temari began. "You
find this to be beautiful and not disgusting like seventy-five
percent of the world's male population. You're so romantic. We
should get to bed though; it's late, and Kankuro will suspect us if
we are caught being in this room."</P><P>"Agreed," Gaara replied before placing his Kazekage hate down on
his desk and going up to his own room.</P><P><B>PLEASE REVIEW!!! I need to know how I did with this, even though
my other lemons won't be this long and emotional. Thank you for
reading and being mature about this.</B></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P><B>Author Notes: Welcome back one and all. I'm surprised that you
guys like my story this much. I'll let you in on a secret. This is
only my second fanfic ever written, and it is the first yaoi one I've
written too. Surprised? Anyway, onto the story.</B></P><P><B>%%%%%%%%%%%%%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$############</B></P><P><B>Suna:</B> The sunlight flowed into the boys' room silently, but
its assistance in keeping the two sleeping demons warm was not
required. Naruto and Kyuubi lay embracing each other in their
peaceful sleep. After the previous night's traumatic and stunning
events, both of them fell victim to sleep. Kyuubi's jutsu still
held firm, so no one could possibly intrude.</P><P>The red-haired fox stirred awake first, noticing his lover cutely
wrapped in his arms. "If only there were words worthy of describing
you my little wolf," he whispered. Kyuubi felt the back of Naruto's
head and stroked his golden mane lovingly as he listened to the boy's
deep breathing. Naruto smiled in his sleep, a sign that brought much
joy to Kyuubi. He placed a light kiss on Naruto's mark, causing
happiness to reverberate through the blond.</P><P>Naruto breathed deeply and sighed as his eyes cracked open. "Are
you awake Naru-Kun?" Kyuubi asked quietly. The boy lifted his head
up to see Kyuubi looking down into his eyes. He smiled and stole a
light morning's kiss from Kyuubi's smiling lips. "Did you sleep
well?"</P><P>"Thanks to you," Naruto said both happily and with a twinge of
guilt. He then noticed that Kyuubi was still inside him.</P><P>"I don't think last night was meant to be something to feel
guilty about Naruto," Kyuubi began as he stroked his lover's
back. "If I had to say, the gods themselves were trying to bring us
together. It was meant to be Naruto; don't try to think otherwise.
I knew you weren't really ready or sure, but nothing bad happened,
right?" Naruto thought about it and nodded. "You were in so much
pain Naruto. I could feel it, so I had to stop it. There wasn't
another way at the rate things were going."</P><P>Naruto was silent for a while as he reflected on what he could
remember. His chakra went out of control, Kyuubi calmed him down at
the expense of his skin being burnt severely, Naruto's body twisted
upon itself, and then Kyuubi took him and gave Naruto relief. All the
while Kyuubi kept telling Naruto to tell him to stop if he felt
violated or hurt. Naruto had never told him to stop; he had placed
his faith in Kyuubi, and he was princely rewarded.</P><P>Naruto embraced Kyuubi tightly and kissed him passionately. "I love
you Kyuubi," he said. "I know you wanted there to be another way,
and the whole time you kept your focus on my feelings. I can't find
a way to repay you enough." Naruto was now quietly crying both in
happiness and sorrow into Kyuubi's shoulder.</P><P>"I don't want anything from you Naruto," Kyuubi replied. "As
long as I know that you love me, and that I love you, I need nothing
more." They rocked back and forth to sooth Naruto's tears, and
the boy finally stopped. "Shall we go have breakfast?" Kyuubi
asked. Naruto nodded, but when they tried to separate, both boys
suffered from slightly sore backs and waves of bliss running through
their bodies. "Crap," Kyuubi breathed when they were half done.
"Just do it quick."</P><P>"Kyuuuuubi," Naruto moaned as they broke apart instantly. Both
young men shook in the sheets as the pleasure washed over them. "Do
you think…" he began.</P><P>"No, people would suspect something," Kyuubi replied to what he
knew the rest of the question was. "Although, we need to clean
ourselves up a bit." Naruto and Kyuubi both looked at each other to
see Naruto's first seed dried in streaks on their stomachs and
chests. "There's a shower in the bathroom; let's go."</P><P>Naruto turned on the warm water and stepped inside; he invited Kyuubi
with the flick of his hand to join him. "I'm sorry about getting
you dirty," Naruto told Kyuubi with a twinge of guilt in his voice.
Kyuubi stopped him by taking the boy's lips in his own fiercely.
Kyuubi blindly felt around for the washcloth he had seen just seconds
before, and he found that Naruto was emitting the scent of
nervousness.</P><P>"What's wrong?" Kyuubi asked as he lifted away from the kiss
and held Naruto.</P><P>"I should have been able to control myself," Naruto said quietly.
This was troubling. Was Naruto actually traumatized from the night
before? His hormones and instincts were running rampant, yes, but
Kyuubi felt Naruto's presence throughout the night.</P><P>"I hurt you, didn't I?" he asked in a resigned tone.</P><P>"No," Naruto began fearfully. "My mind…my body…everything
was going so fast and yet so slow. You didn't hurt me Kyuu; I know
that much, but do I really have to lose control every time we have
sex?" Kyuubi became worried. The boy was mentioning loss of
control.</P><P>"You <I>were</I> in control Naruto; I watched how you fought
against your instincts to keep them from taking over your actions,"
Kyuubi said carefully. "That was why I went slowly, because I knew
you weren't completely yourself." Naruto teared up, but Kyuubi
kissed each one away. "And that was a full moon making your mind a
bit unstable, not loss of control Naruto. That won't happen again,
because we have begun sating our desires. Our hormones are completely
in check now, so it will never get anywhere near that bad again."</P><P>Naruto's expression brightened more and more as Kyuubi went through
his speech, and he was elated that last night would not repeat
itself. "If that's true, then that means I conquered my fears
Kyuu…" He stopped for a second and then took on a devious grin,
making Kyuubi curious. "And that means…you're the Uke tonight,"
he finished suggestively as he took hold of Kyuubi's sleeping
soldier roughly, pulling a moan from the redhead.</P><P>"Not now," Kyuu got out miraculously, making Naruto let go. "From
experience, let me tell you that a male's seed is probably the most
annoying adhesive in all of nature." Kyuubi proved his point by
taking hold of a strand on Naruto's chest and lightly pulling at it
with his nails. The dried gummy crust had become intertwined with
some Naruto's fine chest hairs, making it very painful to have it
pulled off.</P><P>"Owowowowowow...YEEEEEOOOOOW!" Naruto yelled as Kyuubi pulled off
a chunk in one swift motion. Kyuubi put his hand over Naruto's
mouth swiftly.</P><P>"The jutsu isn't active in here," Kyuubi warned. "But I have
a better way of getting it off." Naruto nodded as a painful tear
escaped his eye. Kyuubi leaned down and began licking at the white
lines. After about thirty seconds, a strand came loose, and Kyuubi
separated the boy's hairs out from it before pulling it off bit by
bit.</P><P>"Won't this take longer than us having sex again?" Naruto asked
quietly. Kyuubi scolded himself for not thinking. "We need to get
you clean too."</P><P>"We can lick each other off at the same time, but it involves lying
down," Kyuubi began.</P><P>"There's not much time before Gaara comes looking for us; we need
to finish our hair and the rest of our bodies first. We can worry
about that later…mmmph…mmmph…MMYYYYYYYYYMMPH!" Kyuubi put his
left hand over Naruto's mouth before using a nail to scrape away
the boy's seed from both Naruto and himself. Naruto was crying from
the pain, but the sting of pulled-out hairs disappeared quickly
enough.</P><P>"I'm sorry Naruto," Kyuubi began. "We'll make sure to clean
each other before falling asleep next time." He kissed the
wolf-demon lovingly before they quickly moved onto each other's
hair and the normal cleanup.</P><P>"You owe me Kyuubi," Naruto told his kitsune before conjuring up
his orange ninja suit. The two walked out of their room, and they
reached the stairs to find Gaara coming up.</P><P>"Oh, you guys are finally up," he said cheerfully. Naruto found
the new, cheerful Gaara kind of weird. It was a complete contrast to
his old self. "Normally, we wake up at six or so to meet the dawn,
but I knew you two wouldn't be on a set schedule. Your hair's
wet; did you guys take showers?" the Kazekage asked with a wink.
Naruto knew why too: another guy was coming up the stairs. What was
embarrassing though was the fact that Gaara knew so much about their
current situation and was sort of using that against them. "Go on
out and try some of the restaurants. But try to avoid killing each
other in a brawl please."</P><P>"We promise Gaara-Sama," Kyuubi said with a smile. He took Naruto
by the wrist cuff and yanked him quickly down the flights of stairs.
<I>I wonder if those two will ever know about my watching them,</I>
Gaara thought to himself. <I>They definitely took a shower together;
I know it…. I'm a pervert.</I></P><P>"You have to try these spicy sand monkey ribs Naruto," Kyuubi
said as he lifted one in front of his feasting blond. Naruto sniffed
at it and then took it happily. "I'll never understand where it
all goes," Kyuubi spoke as he carefully plucked the meat off his
own rib.</P><P>Naruto's claws were better knives than the one he received, so his
pointer finger had a couple different sauces on it. "Aah, this is
amazing," Naruto said as he finished off a local fish specialty.
"Oh, the rib, almost forgot." Naruto chewed off some of the meat,
and his eyes became wide as his cheeks flushed. "HOOOOOOOT!" he
yelled. Kyuubi began laughing hysterically along with many of the
Sand villagers and ninja. "Water!" Naruto half-yelled as he
picked up his glass and chugged it down. "Lousy jerk," the
wolf-demon said irked.</P><P>"I did say it was spicy, and I always order mine extra hot," Kyuu
replied. "You just weren't paying attention. It was funny
watching you though." Naruto shut his eyes and frowned. "Oh come
now; be a good sport." Kyuubi looked around carefully to see that
no one was looking in their general direction before stealing a light
kiss from Naruto and returning to his seat.</P><P>"Kyuu," Naruto whispered as he rebuked the fox. "I told you to
not… ha-ha-ha (panting, not laughing) hoooot! Damn you Kyuubi!"
he yelled. Naruto put down thirty-eight Ryou quickly as Kyuubi ran
away in terror. An eight-dollar tip for a thirty-dollar meal was
quite generous in the server's opinion, and the entertainment from
the boy's pain was more than enough to cover the disturbances.</P><P>"Okay, okay, okay…I get it!" Kyuubi yelled as Naruto tried to
hunt him down. "No more spicy food." Naruto was still rightly
furious, so he used his intense speed to get Kyuubi by the collar of
his ninja suit. "Oh man," Kyuubi said quickly and frightfully.</P><P>"You're gonna think twice before you ever purposely poison my
lips again Kyuu-San," Naruto said darkly as he reached into the
sands. Kyuubi heard what the boy was searching for, and he became
fearful. Naruto summoned a shadow clone to keep Kyuubi's mouth open
and hold out his tongue. The real Naruto finally grasped his prize, a
painful but not deadly scorpion. "Before you poison my lips again,
remember what your tongue feels like when I do this," Naruto said
dangerously as he let the black scorpion have its free range back. He
used the Kikánugan to take control, and he stung Kyuubi in the
middle of his tongue.</P><P>"Aaaaaah! That hurts Naru-Kun," Kyuubi yelled in pain. Naruto
relented and released the scorpion back into the sands. The redhead's
tongue began swelling, but Kyuubi's chakra could easily deal with
poison on that level. Many people were stunned by the scene, and
Naruto finally noticed them in embarrassment and shock. "Mah tun
ith too thig Nadutho," Kyuubi said depressively.</P><P>"I apologize for making a spectacle," Naruto began, "but
sometimes people need to learn painful lessons, especially when it
deals with causing pain in others for their own amusement." He said
a bit more quietly and directed at Kyuubi, making him shrink back in
guilt. His real fox ears went flat, but no one could see those.
"He'll be fine; he is a demon with superior healing abilities
after all." Everyone in the area went back to his or her own
business, and Naruto took Kyuubi back to their room.</P><P>"I'm thorry Narutho," Kyuubi said quietly. He wasn't even
using his chakra to reduce the swelling; Kyuubi was sticking to his
word like glue. Naruto began laughing.</P><P>"It's no big deal, and you can fix up your tongue," he replied.
"You'll be needing that at regular size." Kyuubi did as he was
told, but he still felt bad. "Go rinse your mouth out, and then
maybe we can give this village a once in a lifetime gift."</P><P>"Do tell," Kyuubi replied.</P><P>"Not until you remove the sulfurous spices from your mouth."
Kyuubi groaned a bit, but he hurried with Naruto's demands. The
kitsune came back with a curious face on. "I'm gonna make it snow
for Gaara and the others."</P><P>"Don't we need water for that?" Kyuubi asked skeptically. "We
can't just use up the oasis."</P><P>"Are you forgetting who you're talking to my babe?" Naruto
asked before forming a ball of water in his right hand. He tossed the
orb out the window and into the sky before letting his mark do its
work. The snowflake glowed every color of Naruto's fur, a stunning
sight for Kyuu. "As hot as it is, the clouds should form quickly,
but snow will take a while, maybe even all night."</P><P>"Then we have plenty of time for anything else you want to do,"
Kyuubi told him.</P><P>"I should probably tell Gaara first though, or the new weather will
come as a big shock," Naruto replied.</P><P>"Aw," the kitsune whined. "Then what kind of surprise is that?"</P><P>"If you want me to keep it a secret, then we have to go and check
on Shukaku," Naruto said teasingly.</P><P>"I never win. Fine; let's go see the tanuki." Naruto smiled at
Kyuubi acting more mature, and they left the Hokage building quietly.
"Don't be offended if he lashes right out at us. He is the most
affected among the bijuu by the full moon, and he went without a
comforting mate last night."</P><P>"I realize that," Naruto replied as they exited Suna's gate and
blurred into the desert. It took about two minutes of running before
both Naruto and Kyuubi heard the Raccoon's screams in the distance.
"He's in pain," Naruto commented.</P><P>"Nah, he's more depressed and angry than hurting," Kyuu
replied. "He gets like this just about every year."</P><P>"You think he doesn't miss Orochi?" Naruto asked angrily.</P><P>"He misses that ox's body, but Shukaku has never been one to
really show emotion of any kind unless it is anger or glee in
combat."</P><P>"Should we ask Killerbee if he wants to have Orochi unsealed from
him?" Naruto asked. Kyuubi's head turned swiftly, and a look of
shock resided on his face.</P><P>"No one has ever survived a seal being broken or an extraction
Naruto," he began. "We still haven't figured out the specifics
as to why you survived."</P><P>"Our bond is what kept me alive Kyuubi," Naruto began quietly.
The fox's eyes showed curiosity and wonder. "Has any Bijuu ever
loved or cared about his or her jinchuuriki deeply like you did?"
Kyuubi thought for a minute as he tried to recall.</P><P>"I'm pretty sure that that's a no except for Nibi and maybe the
Sanbi as well," he replied. "Nibi has always been extracted
though, never just plain released except when her jinchuuriki died.
What did you have in mind?"</P><P>"A process of weakenings like the ones I experienced," the okami
(wolf) replied. Kyuubi was going to rebut this point, but Naruto
halted him. "I realize that the seals have to be extremely weakened
in order for a jinchuuriki to access a Bijuu's full power, but this
is different. And this is actually a good time to try this with peace
spreading like wildfire. I propose slowly corroding the chakra
shields over a period of weeks or even months. If Killerbee can
remain stable when Orochi's chakra is steadily exiting him all the
time, then why shouldn't he be able to survive the final step?"</P><P>"The bond, even if it doesn't seem strong, is spiritual Naruto,"
the redhead began. "When a Bijuu is forcefully separated from the
jinchuuriki, it tears the weaker soul apart. Obviously, 99.999
percent of human souls are weaker than demons'. We just need to let
nature take its course."</P><P>"What the bloody fucking Hell do you want Youko?" Shukaku asked
from inside a sand cavern. Naruto noticed he had been crying, even if
the sand-demon was good at quickly wiping away tears or absorbing a
lot of liquid into the sand. Kyuubi didn't even take the time to
notice this though. "I stopped the damn sandstorm; or does the new
king require something of me?" Kyuubi was getting angry, but for
what Naruto couldn't tell.</P><P>"We came here to see how you were doing," Naruto replied. "I
was in a lot of pain during that full moon, which means you were
too." Shukaku in his human form looked similar to Naruto when he
was younger, only he had silver hair and orange eyes with a diamond
in them. He lifted his head slowly, stunned by Naruto's words. "You
miss Orochi, don't you?" Naruto asked. Shukaku flared at this.</P><P>"You came here to torture me Kyuubi!" he yelled before firing off
an air bullet at Naruto. Kyuubi had no time to react, but Naruto just
stood there passively as the massive shot hit him dead on in the
chest. When he could see again, the kitsune found Naruto's jacket
to be torn; Naruto's chest itself was bleeding. Naruto reopened his
eyes, but he kept on a passive look even as he felt pain from the
wound.</P><P>Shukaku sat in shock at what he had done, and tears spilled from his
eyes. "Do you want to talk?" Naruto began. "We will leave if
you wish Shukaku-San, but I think you would do better with some
company."</P><P>"Just go," the silver-haired man replied in a hurt voice. "No
one really cares anyway. They'll jump right in to help
Nekomata-Chan, but I'm the lowest rung on the ladder." He formed
a wall of sand in front of himself as he teared up, leaving Naruto
and Kyuubi outside his sanctuary.</P><P>"See Kyuubi?" Naruto said sternly. "Even though you experienced
my life with me, you're still insensitive to things like that. What
would you do if I got sealed?"</P><P>"I'd kill your container and get you out," the man replied
quickly as he came over and examined Naruto's sliced chest. "You
should heal that before it scars."</P><P>"Unless you learn what it means to really love someone and respect
his or her wishes, there is no way in Hell that I'm becoming your
mate Kyuu-San," Naruto said sternly as his chakra sealed up the
cuts. Kyuubi was shocked and hurt beyond normal possibility, and he
stood there, silent in disbelief and hurt. <I>He'd deny me so
easily?</I> Kyuubi asked himself.</P><P>"When Shukaku lowers that wall, I want you to try and reach out to
him for real Kyuubi," the Bijuu lord spoke. "You are not allowed
to take me again until you start trying to understand him. I however,
already reached out, so your body is still open to me for tonight."</P><P>"I believe I have a right to say no," Kyuubi replied in an
attempt to discourage Naruto. The boy was beginning to throw his
weight around, and Kyuubi didn't like this Naruto one bit.</P><P>"But who says you'll say no?" Naruto asked. "You might
survive tonight, but what about the next and the next? Eventually…
my hormones will rage again in a surge, and you'll want to give me
relief. The only thing is, you would have to surrender your body to
me, or I could simply try self-pleasure."</P><P>"Damn you and your perverted senseis," Kyuubi replied. He
realized however, that Naruto was right. Tonight they'd be itchy,
but tomorrow they'd be flushed all over again. And then real Mating
Season began. "Fine; I really don't have much choice considering
the fact that Mating Season is two nights from now."</P><P>Shukaku had not heard the two and assumed they had left, so he
dropped his sand wall as he thought about his beloved. "You're up
Kyuu-San." Kyuubi suppressed his chakra completely before stepping
back into view. Shukaku had his forehead resting on his arm which sat
on both of his knees. He shook lightly as he sobbed for his missing
mate.</P><P>Kyuubi used his chakra lightly to make sure he didn't produce a
sound as he made it over to where the silver-haired raccoon was
sitting. He even managed to sit down beside the man without being
noticed. Naruto watched with the Kikánugan to make sure Kyuubi
wasn't faking it.</P><P>He let his aura return so slowly and easily that Shukaku didn't
take notice of it. "Are you okay Shukaku-San?" Kyuubi asked
quietly and carefully. The man's head shot up in surprise. <I>Did
he just put "San" at the end of my name?</I> The raccoon asked in
disbelief.</P><P>"Why the Hell would you care?" the orange-eyed tanuki asked as he
put his head back down a bit. Kyuubi established a connection with
Naruto and communicated with him through the chakra.</P><P>"I don't…but I should," Kyuubi replied. Naruto and Shukaku
both gawked.</P><P>"This is a shocker. For the first time in history, you're showing
humility and even sympathy. My how you've fallen," Shukaku said
humorously. Kyuubi tried to get Naruto to see this as Shukaku being
outright rude like he was every single day of every year before that.</P><P>"I'm trying to help you because I'm your brother in a sense,
and I know it seems unreal, but I won't just sit here and be mocked
by you," Kyuubi replied in an even tone. He was keeping very calm
considering. Shukaku had hundreds of insults to throw at him though,
and it went back and forth for an hour before Shukaku was finally
willing to talk.</P><P>"All you guys ever do is treat me like a damn, whiny six-year-old,
and I don't enjoy it despite popular belief," he said rudely.
Kyuubi kept looking at him in the eye and kept his temper under
control. "I'm also never really a part of our meetings and
decisions because I'm the weakest. I have feelings and
contributions too, but none of you listen to me except Orochi."</P><P>"I'll admit it. I never treated you very fairly, but you asked
for it a lot of times," Kyuubi replied. "If you want to impress
the others and maybe get a better standing with the rest, you could
try to not act on impulse alone. A good example would have been
mocking me back at that cave and insulting and undermining Naruto."</P><P>"How was I supposed to believe that you of all people found the
first ten-tailed demon in existence?" Shukaku asked curiously.</P><P>"You didn't have to outright laugh at him and insult him is my
point," Kyuubi replied. "Orochi could even pay testament, so you
should have…"</P><P>"Oro-Sama!" Shukaku wailed. He went back to sobbing into his
arms, leaving Kyuubi in an awkward spot. <I><B>Hug him and see where
it goes, then you can have your equal rights back,</B></I> Naruto
said into his mind. Kyuubi grimaced, but he changed his scent to
smell soothing to the crying raccoon next to him. Then the kitsune
leaned down and rubbed Shukaku's shoulder and back caringly.
Shukaku then hugged him tightly, an odd gesture coming from Shukaku.
He knew what to do from when he did this with Naruto though, and he
lovingly caressed the Tanuki's hair while he held his back. Shukaku
cried openly into his shoulder, and he really seemed like a lost
child.</P><P>"Kyuubi-San," the man cried into his shoulder. Kyuubi rocked them
back and forth to calm the nerves, and Shukaku became tired quickly,
ceasing his tears. "I'm pathetic aren't I?" he asked
grievously.</P><P>"No, I was just never very sensitive until I met Naruto, his
mother, and even his father's soul," Kyuubi replied. "When I
think about it, I'd do anything to get Naruto back if he was
sealed, even kill his container without question, but not if it hurt
his feelings. And Orochi is quite fond of Killerbee. You also aren't
strong enough to storm across the Land of Lightning to get him
anyway. You've got it the worst out of all of us Shukaku, and I'm
sorry I never acknowledged that." Kyuubi continued stroking the
man's hair and back until he fell asleep in Kyuubi's arms. <I>Should
I leave?</I> he asked Naruto through the connection. Naruto gave his
approval, and Kyuubi formed a makeshift pillow of condensed sand for
Shukaku's head before leaving with his blond.</P><P>"Now do you know how deep love runs?" Naruto asked.</P><P>"Nope, because it is different for each person," Kyuubi replied.</P><P>"That's my big fox," Naruto said jokingly. "But seriously, do
you understand Shukaku better now?" Kyuubi nodded. "The sun is
setting."</P><P>"We'll make it," Kyuubi told him before they faded in dust
toward the village. Less than a quarter mile out though, Naruto began
feeling the itchy heat crawling through him. They were so close too.
"I know Naruto, but we can't reveal ourselves to the world yet
unless you wish to." The wolf-boy nodded in reply as they flew
through the gate and up to the Kazekage Mansion. "And the key
unlocks the door," Kyuubi spoke as he turned it. "Hurry on in and
wait for my jutsu."</P><P>Kyuubi ran through the one-hundred-ten seals for both his illusion
and soundproofing before Naruto and himself dispelled their clothing.
They weren't feeling sore or flushed, but the uncomfortable heat
still crawled through them. "You know," Kyuubi began, "some
nights we're gonna have to go at it multiple times during Mating
Season's third week."</P><P>"By then we'll be ready for it though," Naruto replied. "Now
fulfill your promise." Kyuubi found this dominating Naruto to be
cute and attractive, but he was by no means an always Uke, and
neither was Naruto. They were equals on this field, and they both
understood that.</P><P>Naruto's erection was only starting to appear, but Kyuubi had been
hard from before they had entered the village. "Eager are we?"
Naruto asked. Kyuu smirked at this; both boys were becoming
intoxicated with the other's arousal, and it only served to build
each other up further. He laid Kyuubi down on the mattress and kissed
him deeply, licking Kyuubi's bottom lip and gaining entrance
fairly. The redhead fought back for dominance, but this was Naruto's
night, and the wolf-boy had no intention of giving it up. He beat
Kyuubi at last and explored the fox's cavern fervently, realizing
that his mouth was still partially spicy. This was sexy though, not
Hellish, flaming spicy.</P><P>After gaining confidence in this area, Naruto mimicked Kyuubi's
seductive cock rubbing. "Naru-Sama," Kyuubi moaned. Naruto was
really sensitive, so he felt the effects, but Kyuubi was like putty
in his hands, an equal exchange that Naruto had sought from this
aspect of their relationship. Lust tried to rear its ugly head
through impatience, but Naruto beat it back.</P><P>"This'll be new to me, but let us see how well you stretch my
Kitsune no Youko," Naruto said huskily, making Kyuubi harder.
Naruto grabbed the familiar phial from the drawer, and he could
notice now that the oil had a bluish tint to it. "How do I make my
nails retract?" Naruto asked.</P><P>"Cause still tension on your fingers by spreading them wide or
doing this," Kyuubi replied as he showed his knuckles all bending
weirdly.</P><P>After two tries, Naruto was successful. "Thanks, but now you're
mine," he said as he slicked up his three fingers like Kyuubi had
before. "Remember to relax." Kyuubi did his best to relax
entirely, but found it impossible as Naruto pressed his index finger
passed his anus.</P><P>"Oohh," Kyuu hissed. "Go slow for now please." Naruto did as
his lover requested, and he found that heavenly place inside Kyuubi
that just rattled the fox's nerves. He poked it lightly, and Kyuubi
shivered, moaned, and arched into the touch. "Damn you're good."</P><P>Naruto inserted his second finger and began a scissoring motion to
stretch him out. After several minutes of this, Kyuubi's body
seemed to be completely relaxed with the intrusion, so Naruto added
his final finger and made sure to rub Kyuubi's prostate as he
finished getting the anal ring to be flexible enough. They both had
ten and a half inch cocks, so it was better to be careful.</P><P>Naruto pulled his fingers out, making Kyuubi whimper a little as he
kissed the man. He stopped as he remembered what Kyuu had done the
night before. "You don't have to Naruto; I'm ready," Kyuubi
told him, but Naruto got on one knee and stroked Kyuubi brilliantly,
regaining his hardness.</P><P>Naruto found how to retract his fangs and breathed a slow but hot
breath onto the shaft before flicking his tongue across the slit.
"Narutoooo," Kyuubi moaned. Naruto gained some needed confidence
and slowly began swirling his tongue over the head. Kyuubi had a
slightly salty and sweaty taste, and it turned Naruto on even more.
He massaged Kyuubi's abs and finally took the head into his mouth
completely. Kyuubi had a sharp intake of air at the new bliss which
encased him. "No masturbation is anywhere near this good," he
stated as he stroked Naruto's golden mane. Kyuubi began panting, so
Naruto stopped sucking him off and began stroking him slowly as he
reached for the herbal oil.</P><P>"Are you ready Kyuu-San?" Naruto asked huskily.</P><P>"I'm not gonna lose to you," was the breathless man's reply.
Naruto stopped stroking Kyuubi and lubed himself up well before
placing the phial away. Unbeknownst to the two, Gaara and Temari were
watching again, and they made a bet as to who would climax first.</P><P>"Naruto one-hundred Ryou," Temari stated.</P><P>"I think Kyuubi, and I will match that," Gaara replied.</P><P>Kyuubi moaned into Naruto's kiss as he slowly and steadily slid his
dick into the redhead. The entire time, Naruto stroked Kyuubi in a
steady rhythm. "I'm done," Naruto stated as he buried himself
entirely.</P><P>"Just move already," Kyuubi begged.</P><P>"As you wish." Naruto slowly drew out and went back in after
coming almost all the way out. He missed Kyuubi's prostate the
first two times, but the fox yelped as soon as Naruto got it down.
"My, you're already leaking," Naruto commented as he began
stroking Kyuubi again. Even while kissing deeply, Kyuubi looked down
to see himself releasing precum. He'd never had that problem during
masturbation, but this was in a whole other league of pleasure.</P><P>"Speed up Naruto," Kyuubi whispered as he shook from his prostate
being touched. Naruto complied and doubled his current pace. Kyuubi
yipped every time their hips collided, but then Naruto picked him up
by the hips and began again, pushing deeper into Kyuubi's body.
"Kami you're amazing little man," he sighed and moaned.</P><P>"Care to redo your bet Temari?" Gaara asked.</P><P>"No way," was her quick response.</P><P>Naruto could feel the familiar tightness building in his stomach, but
Kyuubi was nearing release too. He changed his angle so as to rub
passed instead of straight into Kyuubi's prostate, heightening the
kitsune's pleasure even more. "Naruto, I'm…" The boy cut
him off with a kiss as he sped up again. They quickly had to break
apart for air though, so Naruto went down to Kyuubi's neck and
licked it lustfully as he matched the rhythms of his thrusting and
pumping. "Naruto," Kyuubi said loudly.</P><P>"Not yet, cum with me Kyuubi," Naruto said huskily as he bit down
lightly on Kyuubi's neck, not drawing blood, but it was enough to
finally send Kyuubi over the cliff.</P><P>"Narutooo!" Kyuubi yelled as he shook under the boy's
ministrations. Naruto took him into a fiery kiss before the fox's
warm seed shot forth onto not only their torsos, but their faces as
well.</P><P>"Kami Kyuu," Naruto screamed as the kitsune's virgin walls took
his cock into a death grip mid-stroke, pulling Naruto's own orgasm
from him. Waves of pleasure shot through them both as Naruto's
semen filled Kyuu's insides. "Oh Kami," Naruto breathed before
collapsing into the bed beside Kyuubi.</P><P>"You owe me a hundred Temari," Gaara said victoriously.</P><P>"Damn it," Temari spat as she pulled out her wallet. She forked
over the money, but they continued watching.</P><P>"I must be better at this Kyuu-san, because you came higher,"
Naruto teased through faded breath. Kyuubi smiled back at him. "Did
you enjoy losing <I>your</I> virginity?"</P><P>"Kami Naruto," he began, "if I wasn't so tired, I'd ask you
to take me again, but we need to clean up." Kyuubi and Naruto had
seed on opposite cheeks, so Naruto got his first taste of the stuff.</P><P>"It's kinda salty, but I though it'd be much worse," Naruto
commented.</P><P>"May I have a taste?" Kyuubi asked before kissing the blond with
his tongue and tasting himself on his tongue. They finished cleaning
each other off and detached before Kyuubi fell asleep in Naruto's
loving embrace.</P><P>"Good night, my crimson fox," he said before kissing the back of
Kyuubi's head and pulling the covers over them and falling asleep.</P><P><B>Did you like it? Read and Review.</B></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P><B>Author Notes: Welcome back one and all. I'm surprised that you
guys like my story this much. I'll let you in on a secret. This is
only my second fanfic ever written, and it is the first yaoi one I've
written too. Surprised? Anyway, onto the story.</B></P><P><B>%%%%%%%%%%%%%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$############</B></P><P><B>Suna Desert:</B> Shukaku awoke to find no one in his abode. Had he
dreamed it, Kyuubi's kindness? Then he noticed the pillow-like
thing where his head had been sitting. He never slept with one…so
someone had been there. As he became fully conscious, Shukaku began
feeling very flushed.</P><P>"Orochi-Kun," he spoke quietly. "I wonder if Kyuubi and Naruto
will come back. <I>That'll</I> prove things one way or another."
He then began feeling a presence not far from his cave mouth. "Show
yourself," Shukaku commanded. "You're no demon, so what is your
name human?"</P><P>"I don't think my name is something a helpless thing like you
should know," a man replied haughtily as he stepped into view. "I'm
here for two reasons: to test my mettle and to try and take you back
to my nation." Shukaku had to strain his eyes to see, but the
emblem upon the tall man's forehead was unfamiliar to him. It was
the mark of the Shadow Country.</P><P>"That's pretty arrogant of you to assume you can take me so
easily," the raccoon replied as he got up.</P><P>"Every demon is much easier to capture when he or she is in heat
though, or so my informant told me," the pale stranger told him.
Shukaku blushed, but he also felt a twinge of fear at the man's
knowledge.</P><P>Naruto's mark began prickling as he saw visions of a battle between
Shukaku and a Shinobi with incredible skill. When Shukaku finally
screamed out for help, Naruto's visions faded. He awoke with a
start and was breathing heavily. Kyuubi was in his arms, so he awoke
as well.</P><P>"What's wrong Naru-Kun?" he asked concernedly. "Is your heat
back already?"</P><P>"Shukaku's in danger," Naruto told him as he sprung up and
summoned his black and red ninja suit. "Hurry and dress. Then
follow me into the desert."</P><P>"Wait. What…" Kyuubi began asking as Naruto faded away. "What
on Earth?" Kyuubi summoned his own black and grey skin-tight
fighting garments. "This had better be good Naruto," he commented
as their range was overexerted. Kyuubi sprang out the door, leaving
it unlocked as he flew down the stairs and out into the village. It
was just passed sunrise, but he didn't meet too many people along
the way.</P><P>"Crap," Naruto spat. "Our bonding thing is getting in the way.
Hurry up Kyuubi." He finally arrived at Shukaku's cave to find
that there had certainly been a battle, and there were blood spatters
all over the place. Naruto noticed the trail of footprints leaving
the area and created an ice spike pointing in the direction he was
going so that Kyuubi could follow. "Please don't let me be too
late Shukaku-San," Naruto begged.</P><P>"You weren't all that tough actually," the pale man taunted the
half-conscious tanuki. "I really hope the boss knows what he's
doing by stuffing you into him." Shukaku couldn't really move,
but he was terrified by what he had heard. <I>Some guy's gonna seal
me again?</I> he asked in his mind sorrowfully.</P><P>The pale man walked into a cave in the side of a small rock formation
and continued down a bunch of stairs while carrying the sand-demon on
his shoulder. "Good thing you're light," he told the raccoon.</P><P>"Ah, so you succeeded Ryoichi?" asked a deep voice sitting on a
stone chair. "Now the lot of you, set up the jutsu. If you want
lunch, you'll hurry up and get this guy bottled on up." Five
other Shadow-ninja crawled from the darkness and began writing the
jutsu on the floor. When they finished, Shukaku was placed in the
middle as the writing began glowing a light blue. "Get ready for a
marathon," the leader warned.</P><P><I>Kami someone help me please,</I> Shukaku begged in his mind.
Ryoichi sat down and formed numerous hand signs. "Sealing
Technique: Tetragram Flow," the six called. The apparent leader sat
down next to the paralyzed Shukaku who began crying. <I>Orochi…Sama,
please forgive me. Someone… anyone…stop them please.</I></P><P>"It'll be over soon enough little boy." Shukaku looked to see
that the man's face had been torn off at some point before, because
scar tissue took up much of it. Even his lips were paled. <I>Like
Hell I'm getting stuck inside you,</I> the raccoon thought angrily.</P><P>Naruto stormed into the cave and used the Kikánugan to search the
rooms, when he spotted Shukaku and noticed his soul being dragged
out, he was horrified and enraged. <B>"Damn all of you
Shadow-ninja!"</B> he roared in his demon voice as he tore the door
off of its hinges.</P><P>"Oh fuck no," the leader began as he sprang up. "It's the
newly born Juubi no Okami; we can't fight that." All of his
subordinates panicked except Ryoichi.</P><P>"Even if you're ten times stronger than this weakling, I can
still beat you," he boasted. Kyuubi was not far behind, so Naruto
was back at full strength. "A demon in heat is a demon in heat:
weak."</P><P>"I will see to it that you burn in Hell," Naruto told the man
darkly before closing the distance between them and biting his neck
out fiercely and crushing his skull with one hand, piercing it first
with his five claws and impaling the brain. Naruto dropped the neck
flesh as Ryoichi fell backward and died. The blood in his mouth only
served to heighten his thirst for battle however, so he sliced and
diced everyone in the room in an instant. When the jutsu faded,
Naruto's senses came back, and he rushed down to Shukaku's body.</P><P>The raccoon was barely conscious, but he was crying tears of joy at
the sight of Naruto. "I'll fix you up quickly," Naruto informed
him. He placed his hands over the worst wounds and allowed his
luminous chakra to flow into them, almost instantly sealing them up,
but Shukaku still could not move. "You've been paralyzed,"
Naruto realized when he activated the Kikánugan. Two of his lower
vertebrae had been cracked, and Naruto had no experience dealing with
injuries of this severity.</P><P>"Kami, Shukaku-San," Kyuubi yelled as he walked into the now
gruesome room. "How did this happen?" he asked until he noticed
the writing and the headbands. "Fucking bastards tried to seal him
didn't they?" Naruto nodded.</P><P>"I don't know how to treat paralysis Kyuu," Naruto began. "All
I know is that one wrong move can make it permanent."</P><P>"Keep his back straight and turn him over first," the kitsune
commanded. He then ripped the back of Shukaku's robe open to reveal
a highly bruised back. Ryoichi must have had very good taijutsu
skills if he could do this much damage. "I know it sounds weird,
but use your chakra to slice a vertical hole above the damaged
vertebrae."</P><P>"I just need to make sure it isn't too deep," Naruto replied.
He focused his wind chakra to create a long and shallow scalpel at
his fingertip. The boy cringed, and Shukaku cried harder as he sliced
his back open so easily.</P><P>"Now we'll both carefully piece together the cracked fragments,
and then we'll both pump them full of healing chakra," Kyuubi
told him as he went to work on the upper vertebrae. They weren't
shattered, so it wasn't like a puzzle, but Naruto was extra careful
nonetheless. "And now we heal." The fox and wolf both pumped
their kinsman full of their extraordinary chakra. The cut sealed up
faster than the bones healed, but after about ten minutes, Shukaku
used his arm to sit up. "Are you alright Shukaku-San?" Kyuubi
asked concernedly.</P><P>The young raccoon hugged him fiercely and cried tears of joy and
relief. "I hoped so much that I hadn't dreamed yesterday, but you
really were there trying to help me. Oh thank you Kyuubi-San," he
said loudly. Kyuubi hugged him back and patted him on the back
reassuringly. "Let me put on a new robe," he said before
instantly changing to a midnight blue and white floral robe.</P><P>"You should really be thanking Naruto; he's the one that had
visions about you fighting and losing," Kyuubi told him. Shukaku
turned to the blond to find that he was shaking.</P><P>"Naruto-Sama!" Shukaku began. "Are you alright?" The boy was
sitting down and shivering, and blood trailed down from his mouth and
neck. He held his arms tightly, drawing blood as his claws tore his
jacket and sliced his skin. "Have you been hurt?" Naruto remained
motionless as he continued his shallow and labored breathing.</P><P>"Kyuu," he whispered in an odd tone. He lifted his head to reveal
one eye teeming with anger and bloodlust. He was in a state of terror
and desperation, horrifying Kyuubi and making Shukaku lose face.</P><P>"Naruto, calm down," Kyuubi told him as he took hold of the boy.
"You're with friends; just breathe deeply and try to calm your
nerves." Naruto let a tear escape him as he buried his face in
Kyuubi's shoulder. He still held fast to his own arms however.</P><P>"He ingested their blood," the raccoon stated in fear. "That's
making his instincts go nuts."</P><P>"I know," Kyuubi replied. "Just let it out Naru-Kun." His
mark flashed red once, and Kyuubi felt the dark intentions leave the
air. Naruto looked up into his eyes, his own back to their
sapphire-like brilliance. The blond's grip on his own arms
slackened, and the rivulets of blood stopped as his chakra closed the
puncture wounds.</P><P>"Kyuubi," he said quietly. "I…I felt like I wanted to kill,
just to kill for its own sake. Something kept telling me to bite, to
claw out at you. Please forgive me Kyuu-San," Naruto begged as he
held the fox's shoulders. His crying was now apparent, and Kyuubi
stroked the back of his head and changed his scent to one of comfort
so as to ease his beloved.</P><P>"And I was told that all demons were heartless and cruel," said a
young man from the doorway. Shukaku turned to him angrily, but Kyuubi
signaled for him to wait. He was barely sixteen, black hair and
innocent dark brown eyes. "I was told the boss would be sealing a
demon and not to disturb them, but you've killed my entire team."
His words were not taunting, not angry, not even sorrowful; they
sounded as if he was…confused maybe?</P><P>"All three of you are Bijuu…aren't you?" he asked calmly and
quietly. Kyuubi and Shukaku nodded, the raccoon still ready to spring
at a moment's notice. His expression changed subtly, but his voice
changed more dramatically. "Am I going to die?" Neither demon
knew how to answer this question yet. Kyuubi looked him over closely.
The boy's heart rate was intense, and he was sweating in fear, but
what Kyuubi was looking for were the boy's motives and thoughts.</P><P>Naruto's head rose from Kyuubi's shoulder, and he spotted their
visitor. "Kikánugan," he said flatly.</P><P>"No, please don't," the young man begged as he fell on his
behind and looked into the golden orbs. "Nee-Chan," he spoke
quietly. Nothing appeared to be happening for several long minutes,
but then Naruto smiled and got up, walking over to him. "Kami
please," he said aloud. The wolf's hand stretched out to him,
making the youth believe he would soon die. The boy shut his eyes and
held his arms over his head protectively.</P><P>Another eternity seemed to go by before the boy opened his eyes and
looked up. Naruto's hand was held out to him, offering to help him
up. "You're still innocent," Naruto commented. "What's your
name?" The boy hesitantly grabbed his hand and pulled himself up.</P><P>"You're letting me live?" the boy asked. Naruto nodded in
response with a smile. "I don't have a last name, so just call me
Nagato. But why me? Why are you only sparing me?"</P><P>"Because he's got a heart not made of stone, and he can see into
your mind with his Kikánugan," Kyuubi stated as he got up. Shukaku
stood up as well, but he didn't really trust this Nagato kid.</P><P>"You have no knowledge of demons, and what you have heard from your
captain you do not believe. If one can be changed to view my kind
peacefully, then I will spare that person," Naruto stated. "You're
from the Shadow Country right?"</P><P>"I don't really know where I came from," Nagato admitted. "They
took me in and trained me to be a ninja, but I couldn't think the
way they wanted me to."</P><P>"And that is why you should live," Naruto concluded. He took the
headband from him before breaking it in his hand. "We are not far
from the Village Hidden in the Sand. You should come back with us and
enlist as a ninja of The Alliance."</P><P>"They'd sooner run me through than talk to me," Nagato
stammered fearfully.</P><P>"If you value your life as much as I know you do, then you need to
trust me," the wolf-demon told him. "Without our guidance, you
will wander the desert and die alone. I'm a personal friend of the
Kazekage, so they won't kill you if you're with me." Naruto
smiled broadly, and Nagato was amazed.</P><P>"You're friends with a human? With the Kazekage?" he asked.
Naruto nodded in response.</P><P>"We need to get going soon, but I can tell you that Gaara, the
Kazekage, was once a jinchuuriki like I was before Kyuubi got out and
I transformed," Naruto began. "Shukaku here was sealed in him."
Nagato gawked, but he followed the three out of the hideout and into
the desert.</P><P>"How are we going to make it to the Village Hidden in the Sand on
foot?" Nagato asked disbelievingly. "It'll take all day."</P><P>"Ryoichi barely took an hour, but you can't keep up with our
speed, so you get a treat today," Naruto replied. To Nagato's
amazement, all three of them transformed into their Bijuu forms. "Go
ahead; climb up on my back and hold on tight." He was stunned that
the giant shining wolf had spoken without even having to open his
mouth.</P><P>"You're…huge," was all Nagato could say. Naruto picked him up
in his enormous paw to Nagato's fear and amazement. "Whoa,
um…okay."</P><P>"If you don't hold on, you're gonna fall headfirst into the
sands," Kyuubi warned. He and Shukaku had the scarier forms within
the group, so the boy tried to avoid looking at them as they trotted
off towards the village.</P><P>"This-is-kinda-weird," Nagato commented as he bounced up and down
at Naruto's movements. He changed the way he sat for an easier
ride. "So why are all three of you staying here in the desert?"
This was the awkward subject that they wished to avoid, but the boy
asked outright.</P><P>"Let me deal with this," Naruto told the other two. "This
desert is Shukaku's home to the best of my knowledge, but Kyuubi
and I are here because of our relationship."</P><P>"So you guys live in far apart nations, and this place is like the
middle between them?" he asked. "You guys seem like good friends,
but how long are you here for?"</P><P>"It's a bit more complicated than that," Naruto told him.
Kyuubi looked back at him and facially asked if he needed help, but
Naruto could handle it. "We're here because my village doesn't
like us being together. We actually both live in the Hidden Leaf
Village."<p></P><P>"Wait; you just said, you guys being together?" Nagato stammered.</P><P>"Promise me you'll just listen until I'm done," Naruto asked.
Nagato nodded; he was curious. "The first thing you need to realize
is that humans view demons as their enemies. As such, our belief
systems are different; I still don't know very much about demon
society having been one for only about a week. Demons actually live
quite peacefully and try to avoid conflicts with humans, but when we
display our power, some become fearful of us or begin to covet our
power, wanting it for their own. This is why jinchuuriki have
existed."</P><P>"Among our beliefs, the ones about partners are relatively similar,
but there are…differences." Nagato's expression changed to one
of confusion, but he remained silent. "Perhaps it is best that I
tell you it is currently Demon Mating Season." An awkward silence
fell over them all, and Nagato finally got where this was headed.</P><P>"Demons don't make prejudices against same-gender couples like
humans do, and many demons bed both sexes," Naruto told him as he
blushed beneath his fur. "What I'm trying to explain is that
Kyuubi and I are lovers. This is why Kyuubi and I left our home
village for a while; I know that they would toss us out the second
they knew, and this is my first heat, so you can imagine."</P><P>"You're gay?" the boy asked outright. Shukaku became irked, but
Kyuubi gave the raccoon a warning look.</P><P>"As I said, demons don't make that distinction. That isn't even
a word to us, and we value love and affection over lust," Naruto
began. "When you really love someone, be that person male or
female, you should pursue that person. If he or she denies you, it
means that that person is either not ready for a relationship or this
person is simply not meant for you."</P><P>"But that's just weird, two guys…you know," Nagato began.</P><P>"Don't knock it until you try it," Naruto told him humorously,
ending the conversation. "Shukaku here is the mate of Orochi, the
Eight-Tailed Ox who is also male."</P><P>"Are all the Bijuu mates with the same sex?" Nagato asked.</P><P>"Primarily yes, but there are two couples Kyuubi who are opposite
sex?" Naruto asked. Kyuubi nodded.</P><P>"Nibi no Nekomata and Rokubi no Raijuu, and Sokou and Kaku are the
only opposite sex couples. The rest of us are all paired up with
another guy. There are only two female Bijuu," Kyuubi stated
calmly.</P><P>"So you're saying there wasn't much choice," the boy
commented deviously. "I get it."</P><P>"Wrong. Even though we Bijuu are the strongest demons in existence,
we can choose to be partners with other demons if we so wished,"
Naruto replied. "If we fall in love with one of our own or with
another, so be it. Love is love, be it between a male and female, two
males, or two females."</P><P>"Demons are really a strange bunch," the boy commented. "But
your numbers must be small if a bunch of same-sex couples exist. How
do you expect to have kids?"</P><P>Naruto stopped and began thinking about it. He really did want to
have a kid someday, human or not. Even if he loved Kyuubi, that would
mean either a surrogate or adoption, and that one just wasn't
equivalent to being <I>his kid</I>.</P><P>"Hoo-boy," Kyuubi began. "I didn't want to bring this up for
a couple years Naruto, and this will probably mortify <I>you</I>
boy." He paused. "Same-sex partners in demon society…can in
fact sire a young one together, without the use of a surrogate."
Awkward silence hung in the air, and Naruto's mind became a train
wreck.</P><P>"You mean to tell me Kyuubi that you could have impregnated me?"
Naruto asked furiously. His eyes flashed red, all of his tails were
raised threateningly, and he growled angrily deep in his throat,
frightening Nagato who was already drained of color.</P><P>"Hold on and let me fully explain the situation," Kyuubi began.
Naruto was angry as a bull, but he held himself down. "Demon
childbirth is extremely rare for two reasons. One is the random
factor, but the other, more decisive one is that demons have the
choice as to whether or not they wish to have a baby. Luckily for us,
even if we went at it a thousand times, unless we both made the
conscious decision, there would be a zero percent chance of you or me
becoming pregnant. Even during Mating Season, when we are at our most
fertile, the chance is still barely one in a hundred that a child
will be sired. I'm sorry, but I didn't want to really bring it up
until the day came when you decided you wanted a child."</P><P>"I hate hearing this talk," Shukaku groaned. He was blushing beet
red, but Naruto might have been in a worse mental state. His thoughts
were racing, but his body was frozen in place.</P><P>"Demons are freaking nuts," Nagato finally spoke. "Nothing
about what you just said makes sense at all."</P><P>"Demons are more in tune with nature than humans, so of course it
doesn't make sense to you," Kyuubi rebuked him. "Humans once
had that choice as well, but now a girl easily gets pregnant if she
is raped. Humans 'evolved' from demons in that sense."</P><P>"I have a headache," Naruto finally commented. "Let's just
all get back to the village." They ran on in silence and the
village came into sight fifteen minutes later. By now, the sun was at
its highest point, so they were all sweating except for Shukaku. What
brought relief to the three and shock to the tanuki was the fact that
there were snow clouds hanging over the village.</P><P>"You pulled it off," Kyuubi commented in amazement. "You
brought snow to the desert." They ran up to the main gate, scaring
the heck out of the guards when they spotted Shukaku. "He's with
us, and so is this guy," Kyuubi spoke as he gestured toward Nagato.</P><P>"This is where you get off so I can go back to my human form,"
Naruto said as he lifted the boy effortlessly onto the ground. The
three reverted to human forms and walked calmly into the village to
find a shocked and confused Gaara waiting.</P><P>"I know you did this Naruto," he said darkly as he pointed into
the sky. "Kami, you brought Shukaku too?" The redhead was in
complete surprise. "I better sit down before trying to listen to
this explanation." The four followed Gaara to his office swiftly,
not wanting to anger him. No one else recognized Shukaku's human
form, so they didn't pay the group any mind.</P><P>"Sit, all four of you," he commanded. "Issue 1: the snow, why?"</P><P>"Since Kyuubi and I are staying here for so long and you told us
not to worry about helping out, I thought I'd at least give you the
gift of a once in a lifetime snowfall out here," Naruto said
guiltily. "I can stop it if you really want me to."</P><P>"As long as the villagers get an explanation, they won't think
it's an omen of death. You can let it snow, but don't bury us,"
Gaara told him. "Issue 2: Shukaku. For what conceivable reason did
you stroll back here with him in tow?"</P><P>"I was defeated by a Shadow-Ninja out in the wilderness, and Naruto
and Kyuubi saved me from being sealed into the leader of a
reconnaissance group," the silver-haired boy spoke up. "If it
wasn't for them, I'd be stuck inside a guy so ugly I hope you
never meet his mom. If you think I would have attacked this village,
then no. Naruto-Sama made all of us swear to try and keep the peace
between humans and demons. He's our undeniable king, so his word is
law."</P><P>"He also wants to avoid being sealed so that he can see Orochi
again when Killerbee passes away or we find a way to safely unseal
him," Naruto added. "When I broke into the enemy hideout, I
killed all of the Shadow-ninja except this one."</P><P>"Do you want to interrogate him?" Gaara asked flatly.</P><P>"He has no known parents, and I searched him for both connections
and beliefs. Nagato here would be better suited to serve the
alliance. Of that you have my word."</P><P>Gaara looked at him with his piercing green eyes, but Nagato showed
no signs of lying. "I'll have to see where your skill level lies,
but I'm trusting you because I know I can trust Naruto, so don't
even think about slipping up," he warned. "As per you three, take
a shower please. You smell, bad."</P><P>"As you wish Gaara-San," Shukaku answered. "By the way, I'm
sorry for driving you nuts for all those years." The redheaded
Kazekage gawked. The whole time he knew Shukaku, the only thing he
ever did was send thoughts of flowing blood and fighting through his
head, and he was apologizing for it right now in front of everyone?</P><P>"There's another stroke of maturity; I'm impressed," Kyuubi
told him. "We have a room, but where is Shukaku going to stay and
shower?"</P><P>"Here's a key for room 211," Gaara replied immediately. "Just
go; this room is gonna smell like dead fish soon." He held his
nose, and Gaara's eyes were watering. Naruto sniffed himself and
found that he wasn't too far off with placing it as dead fish
smell. Gaara held his breath and shoved the three demons out of his
office, leaving him alone with Nagato.</P><P>"This may sound perverse, but would you like to watch them?"
Gaara asked. Nagato became mortified at the question and turned him
down swiftly. "Alright then, now, about your standing as a ninja
for this village."</P><P>Shukaku went to his room quickly and found it to be well-decorated.
He sat on the soft bed and savored the feel. The raccoon-boy really
did prefer a bed to sand, but he was almost never welcome into
anyone's home. "I wonder if I should…" he began. His orange
eyes showed a devious pleasure as he summoned a third eye. "I bet
they aren't really that close yet," he mused. "They probably
still take showers separately." His eye moved up a floor and
watched as Kyuubi and Naruto entered their room. "Gotcha."</P><P>"At least it isn't a hundred degrees, or this would be
uncomfortable," Naruto commented. "Now off with the clothes; I
need something beautiful to look at so I don't get bored." Kyuubi
smiled, and they both dispelled their clothing before kissing,
shocking Shukaku.</P><P>"I bet they won't take a shower together. Naruto-Sama is just a
perv," the raccoon told himself, but his suspicions were doused as
they both walked into the bathroom and shut the door. His eye went
through the wall, and Shukaku watched in amazement as the two simply
strolled on in.</P><P>"Too bad humans can't understand the complexities of a maturing
demon's scent," Kyuubi mused. "He said dead fish; I say it's
quite masculine and hormonal." The fox wrapped his arms around his
wolf's chest and nuzzled Naruto from behind. "You're more
desirous today."</P><P>"Kyuu," Naruto giggled as he nuzzled back. "Mating Season truly
starts tomorrow, so of course my body is more desirous. You seem to
be doing fine though." Naruto stepped out of the hug and turned on
the cool water.</P><P>"I have you to thank for that," Kyuubi replied. He turned Naruto
around and brought him into a loving kiss, making Shukaku blush. The
two canine demons looked deeply into each other's eyes. It didn't
take an expert medical ninja to figure out that this was more than
hormones. Shukaku could barely stand it; Kyuubi got everything better
than him, even down to a better, <B>younger</B> possible mate. His
anger flared, and a silent eeriness fell over the whole building,
even reaching Kyuubi and Naruto.</P><P>The wolf-boy turned to see a third eye hovering by a corner.
"Shukaku?" he asked. Kyuubi was curious at first, but then he
became angered once he saw for himself. "A: why the Hell are you
spying on a rather personal matter?" Naruto wrapped a towel around
his waist. "B: what has you so pissed off?"</P><P>"He's mad at me for being with you," Kyuubi began. "It's an
old wager of sorts, but we discussed mating a few times when I was
really young, younger than you in fact." A sand clone of Shukaku
appeared, but Naruto could see the chakra connection it held with the
real Ichibi.</P><P>"Orochi-Sama can punish me later, but this is why," Shukaku said
lowly. "I'm freaking jealous." Naruto was confused. Didn't he
have a mate? "I mean that, after seeing what you and Naruto-Sama
share, I wish I could be his partner."</P><P>"That's dangerous Shukaku-San," Kyuubi warned. "If it weren't
for the fact that Orochi and I are great friends, I'd…"</P><P>"You'd rat me out," Shukaku finished for him. "It's not
like I could, but I wish I could be his bed partner just to make you
squirm."</P><P>"If you take it any further, they'll come for you Shukaku,"
Kyuubi warned him. "Orochi is forever yours, and you his; don't
break that bond over jealousy; it's not worth it."</P><P>"I apologize for invading your privacy against your will
Naruto-Sama. I'll leave then," Shukaku ended quietly. His clone
and eye disappeared, leaving Kyuubi and Naruto alone again.</P><P>"If he ever tries again, you need to put in an effort too, or the
trial won't find you excusable," Kyuubi told Naruto as he teared
up.</P><P>"This is about being mates isn't it," Naruto spoke. It really
was more of a statement than a question, but he had a frightened
curiosity in his eyes. Kyuubi nodded as he hugged him tightly.</P><P>"Even as the king of the Bijuu, and by extension the second king of
the entire demon realm, you can't simply be excused because of
ignorance," the redhead began. "If Shukaku had taken it much
further, he would have been betraying his bond with Orochi, and since
he was going after you, you'd be executed as well if the court
found that you didn't try to resist him."</P><P>"Oh Kyuubi," Naruto hitched as he rubbed the kitsune's head. "I
understand, but remember that I only love you. You're my partner,
<I>my</I>…" Kyuubi put his hand over the young man's mouth.</P><P>"That bond is sacred, so do not mistakenly call me your mate yet
Naruto," Kyuubi told him sternly. "Once that step is taken, you
may never pursue another, demon or human, male or female, unless I
die. Even then though, it is viewed partly as a mockery by demon
society. We are lovers Naruto, both in bed and emotionally, but we
are not mates."</P><P>Naruto moved the fox's hand from his mouth and began to tear up
before asking "would you want me as your mate?" Kyuubi was
shocked and terrified. His answer was yes, but there were too many
things that it would suggest, and lying would not only hurt Naruto,
but their relationship would be destroyed by it.</P><P>"Naruto, I already told you that you and Nibi were both of equal
importance to me and that I'd wish for you as a second mate if
possible," he began. Naruto's expression lightened a bit. "You
were not raised a demon, so I cannot ask you to understand it
instantly. I'd readily become your mate if not for my own love of
you."</P><P>"What does that mean?" Naruto inquired.</P><P>"You've had a crush on Sakura for many years, and there is a big
possibility for a marriage and relationship there," Kyuubi replied.
"And what of Hinata who loves you so intensely that she is too
embarrassed to admit it?" Naruto's expression changed once more
as he thought back on all of this. "I won't let you torture
yourself for all of eternity because you chose the wrong path without
thinking it through." Naruto brought their lips together softly,
and the familiar warmth of love spread through him. "I would not
dare call this simply a physical relationship Naruto, but there are
other possibilities for love for you. You see? I would become your
mate out of love, but I will refuse you for now out of love as well."</P><P>"And it is because of that that I know you are the right choice,"
Naruto replied with confidence blazing in his eyes. "We do not have
to become mates this year or next, but eventually Kyuubi. I have
chosen you, and my choice will not change."</P><P>"You're so damn sexy when you're like this," Kyuubi commented
huskily. He lightly fondled Naruto's sleeping member, but the blond
would have none of this.</P><P>"This is shower time, not horny sex time Kyuu-San," the boy spoke
as he grabbed Kyuubi's hand forcefully. The fox backed off, and
they washed each other off without further interruption or problems.
"Are you ready for lunch?" Naruto asked as they summoned their
clothes.</P><P>"Sure, I can go for that, but look at the snow," Kyuubi replied.
Naruto looked out to see a steady bunch coming down. "I think it
was a great gift for these people, but I'd let up a bit."</P><P>"There's another gift I can give them, music."</P><P>"Just don't play the song you were that first night when you got
that mark," Kyuubi began sternly. "Play Kushina's lullaby or
something else you know, but that nocturne…just isn't meant to be
heard by humans."</P><P>"I remember being so angry with myself," the blond man began. "My
body just moved on its own, and the notes came with it. I didn't
really know what I was doing."</P><P>"So it came to you, but you don't know how?" Kyuubi asked.
Naruto nodded as he lay on the bed in Kyuubi's arms. "Your
instincts never cease to bewilder me. Neither does this world. You
were so young and innocent, and the world just kept beating the Hell
out of you; it's still trying too."</P><P>Naruto's memories of his childhood began haunting him, and he
couldn't push them back no matter how hard he tried. "Kyuu," he
began as tears came to his eyes.</P><P>"Ya Naruto?"</P><P>"Please don't leave me," Naruto begged as he gripped the
sheets. Kyuubi was stunned. Naruto had already told him countless
times that he loved Kyuubi, but not like this. The angel he held in
his arms was crying both out of pain from the past and out of fear;
it cut deeply into Kyuubi's being, and he somehow felt closer to
his Naruto than ever before. "All I want is to be with you, to have
someone to love and be loved by."</P><P>"I won't ever abandon you Naruto," Kyuubi began. "But you
need to remember your family and friends. What of Kushina-San?"</P><P>"Don't you get it?" Naruto sobbed. "It isn't the same as
with you. I know I will always be accepted by my own mother, but…it
just isn't the same as with you Kyuubi. You were there from the
beginning; you know me better than anyone else; you're closer to me
than anyone else was or ever could be. I just…can't bear…to
have you leave."</P><P>"I think I know why you survived our separation Naruto," the
redhead began as he changed his scent to one of comfort. "It is
because you and I share such a bond. Even though my soul was detached
from your body, you lived on because we were never separated from
each other's hearts. I love you Naruto. That's what saved you."</P><P>The boy turned and embraced Kyuubi as his emotions spilled forth.
Gaara opened the door quietly to ask the two if they wanted to go out
for lunch, but he stopped as soon as he saw Naruto opening himself up
to Kyuubi. The redhead held him close and silently shook his head
when he spotted Gaara. He then began stroking the blond's soft mane
as Gaara left.</P><P>"I think Naruto," he began once more, "that you wouldn't be
able to bear my leaving you in more ways than one, but that isn't
necessarily a bad thing. You're life will change for the better my
young wolf, and you have remained as pure as the snow through the
worst of it. Think it through many times more, but I think becoming
mates is what you truly want and need. You do not have to decide now,
but I am willing to take that step with you tonight if you so wish."</P><P>"I wonder if Shukaku and Orochi were ever this way," Naruto
stated.</P><P>"That is something you would have to ask them," Kyuubi replied
quietly. "Gaara came by not three minutes ago to invite us out for
lunch; would you like to go?" Naruto kissed him passionately as a
final tear escaped him. Kyuubi kissed that away as well before they
got up and went downstairs.</P><P>"Hey Temari-San" Naruto called when he saw her. "Do you know
where Gaara went off to for lunch?" She seemed to find his question
weird by her expression.</P><P>"He went to the Blue Moon Diner, but why are you asking?" she
inquired. Temari smiled in an oddly uncomforting manor. She seemed to
be accusing Naruto of something like a naughty child, but he shrugged
it off.</P><P>"Thanks Temari-San. We'll be back later." Naruto and Kyuubi
walked out the door and asked for directions from a random Genin.</P><P>"I wonder when he'll catch on," Temari ended as she went up to
Gaara's office and dropped off some paperwork. "At least I can be
thankful that he didn't go after Gaara. That would be so awkward.
They are cute together though, he and Kyuubi."</P><P>"Oy, hello Gaara," Naruto called when he spotted the Kazekage. He
was elated to see Naruto all happy again after the scene back with
Kyuubi. "Do you mind if we join you?"</P><P>"Of course I don't mind," the now slightly tan Gaara replied.
"If I may ask, are you feeling better?" Naruto and Kyuubi sat
down and felt a bit nervous responding to the question. "It's
fine; I just want to make sure that my friend is alright."</P><P>"Thanks," Naruto told him as a waitress placed menus in front of
the three. "Anything you'd recommend?"</P><P>"They just got in some nice shellfish from the shore," Gaara told
him.</P><P>"Wouldn't they have to pack it in ice to get it here fresh?"
Kyuubi asked. "Ice is hard to come by unless you have Naruto here
or you go up to the mountains. There aren't any around here
either."</P><P>"Modern day science," Gaara replied. "There is a holding
facility midway between the shore and this village. It is there that
we keep fish eggs and raise our own sea life. While this process
hasn't been perfected, we get very nice crab among some other
easily bred fish."</P><P>"It's a good thing mom gave us that thousand Ryou," Naruto
commented. "I'll try a few spider crabs steamed with compound
butter."</P><P>"That tends to be very good; I'll get a plate of grilled shrimp
with lemon," Gaara stated.</P><P>"Hmm," Kyuubi began. "Everything looks so good. Oh, the flaming
manta wings sound nice. I'll try those."</P><P>"No one has ever been able to finish those because they're so
spicy," Gaara warned him as he drank some water. "Too bad we
can't keep water very cool out here."</P><P>"Hand me the glass," Naruto commanded. "Now, did you say
<I>spicy</I>?" Gaara nodded as Naruto quickly rinsed off his hands
with his chakra and put one finger in the water. A column of ice now
stood in the center. "You better wash your mouth out before kissing
me again," Naruto warned the grinning fox demon quietly. Only Gaara
heard him, and that he was thankful for.</P><P>"Thank you very much Naruto Nii-Chan," Gaara spoke as he took his
glass back and drank a swig. "Ah, I needed that." The three
placed their orders, and twenty minutes later, they were ready to
dine. Before this though, Kyuubi checked to make sure that no one was
looking and stole a quick kiss from Naruto, making both he and Gaara
blush.</P><P>"Damn you," Naruto replied. "You owe me." Kyuubi smiled
inwardly. Yeah, he shouldn't disregard the rules Naruto had set up,
but he was extra careful about doing it, and Naruto was smiling
anyway. Naruto used his knuckle to break open the top of the first
crab, but he stuck to using a fork to dig out the meat.</P><P>"These shrimp are nice and juicy," Gaara commented. He picked up
a lemon wedge and began flavoring up his meal. "Ooogh," he
winced. "Ow, ow, ow that hurts." Gaara's eye was now a tad red
from the lemon juice burning it, but he was otherwise fine.</P><P>"Hagh, hagh," Kyuubi panted. "These are freaking hot." Naruto
barely swallowed his lump of crab before dropping his fork and
laughing. "What's so funny?" Kyuubi grabbed his glass of water
and doused the heat a bit before looking back at Naruto.</P><P>"You, the absolute spice freak, say that something is almost too
hot to eat?" Naruto asked as he teared up from laughing so hard.
Kyuubi moved his face closer to Naruto's and the boy immediately
stopped. "You wouldn't dare," he began.</P><P>"You know full well that I would," Kyuubi warned with a sly grin
as he went back to slicing up the wing of a manta ray. The three ate
and talked for about a half hour, and most of the diner became amazed
by Kyuubi's eating capabilities. He was sweating though, and the
itchiness posed a threat. "I should not have done that," Kyuubi
said as he felt the spices and pepper acids working their way into
the two lines made by his claws. "You done Naruto?" he asked as
the pain increased.</P><P>"Yeah, but are you…" Naruto replied before Kyuubi grabbed his
arm and yanked him into the restroom. "You know, that didn't look
very good to some people out there. Kami, Kyuubi that looks bad."
Kyuubi had pulled off his jacket and shirt to reveal two very red
lines with enflamed skin around them.</P><P>"I should have kept my claws clean, but this hurts almost as bad as
when you first got me with your poison," the redhead told him. No
one was in there at the time, a fact Kyuubi was thankful for. "Could
you maybe help me clean it out a bit?" he asked pleadingly. Naruto
grabbed some paper towels and wet them with some water and his own
spit, which he knew seemed to be good at drawing things out from a
wound.</P><P>"Fffffffff…that stings," Kyuubi winced as Naruto carefully
wiped away the spice powders. He even forced the towels into the cuts
themselves and cleaned the inside. "It still hurts, but thank you
Naruto," Kyuubi said lovingly as he put his shirt and jacket back
on.</P><P>"You're welcome," Naruto replied as he put the now red-smeared
towels into the garbage. Kyuubi washed his hands off thoroughly and
rinsed his mouth too. They walked out to see everyone smiling. <I>Oh
no,</I> Naruto thought to himself. They probably figured out the
two's relationship, but his thoughts were dashed.</P><P>"No one has ever been able to eat them all, but you also got the
sauce in a cut," the head chef commented. "My hat's off to you
for surviving that fiery demon dish." Everyone clapped in
congratulation, relieving Naruto greatly. Naruto paid for his and
Kyuubi's dish before walking outside to find a solid inch of snow
on the ground. The temperature had dropped to twenty degrees already,
so he decreased his chakra output.</P><P>Naruto had told Gaara of his plan to give the village a concert, so
he went to the top of the Kazekage Mansion and formed a concert shell
out of ice. He created a sturdy platform and started letting his
fingers dance over the ice. Kyuubi and the villagers who could hear
him were in awe. Even Naruto found this to be amazing.</P><P>He took song requests throughout the day and into the evening, and
all of the village stood below and listened. The villagers became
chilly though, and Naruto had to cut it off as the sun began setting.
"Have a good night's sleep," he called. Naruto willed for his
power to completely stop, and his concert shell melted into the
sands. The clouds still hung silently over the village, and all was
peaceful until Kyuubi appeared next to him. The fox's chakra was
leaking from him slightly, and Naruto could smell his arousal.</P><P>"It's time to go," he said to Naruto. They walked inside to
find a smiling Gaara awaiting them.</P><P>"Thanks very much Naruto-Kun," he said cheerily. "Everyone had
so much fun." Naruto began feeling his insides twist as his heat
began to overtake him.</P><P>"Look, you're welcome Gaara, but I need to get to sleep," the
blond told him as he began sweating.</P><P>"Then I won't keep you. See you both in the morning," Gaara
told them as he walked down the stairwell.</P><P>Kyuubi unlocked the door and got Naruto into the room before setting
up both of his jutsu. "Are you still okay Naruto?" he asked. "If
you go too long, your arousal builds until it is very painful, and
then the sleeplessness will drive you nuts. Also…have you decided?"</P><P>Naruto kissed him deeply with his tongue as they dispelled their
clothes. "I thought it over time and again," he began, "and the
outcome was always the same. I know in my heart that we are meant to
be together." Naruto bared his neck as ten glistening chakra tails
formed behind him. "Will you take me as your mate?"</P><P>Kyuubi's mind was on fire. How could Naruto be this damn good with
his instincts? This was the stuff of demon fairytales. His partner
was asking Kyuubi to take him as his mate and was showing his
surrender and commitment by baring his neck and showing that all of
his power would be in service to his partner. This was dangerously
arousing, but Kyuubi kept a level head and thought it through.</P><P>"There will be no turning back, no chance for you to first find
love in a human," he said again to make sure Naruto was completely
confident and stood by his choice. "This is the most binding
contract in existence Naruto. Of that I must warn you."</P><P>"Living without you would be Hell to me. I will love you always
Kyuubi," Naruto said quietly and passionately. "If you will allow
it, I wish to become your mate for as long as our lives last."
Kyuubi teared up as he brought out all nine of his chakra tails. He
licked Naruto's neck, the sign of acceptance and beginning.</P><P>"If this is what you desire, then I too am ready to become your
mate Naruto," Kyuubi told him as they kissed once more and walked
over to the bed. The room was bathed in various colors from Naruto's
chakra, and a light and passionate red could be seen everywhere as
well. "When the time comes, trust your instincts. The process of
marking is a complex one that no amount of research has ever been
able to unravel. There are many kinds of marks, and they are all made
rather…violently if you can believe it. Just trust me as I trust
you, and nothing will harm you."</P><P>"I'm so hot," Naruto spoke after breaking from their kiss.</P><P>"This is every night of Mating Season," Kyuubi told him as he
panted. "It is because of how intimate we are being that we are
affected as badly tonight. More arousal will serve no purpose other
than bringing you pain, so we will have to skip some of our normal
routine." Kyuubi grabbed the crystal phial from the drawer and
slicked up his fingers.</P><P>"Kyuubi," Naruto half-moaned as he kissed the one he adored. The
fox retracted his claws and fangs and pressed two fingers into
Naruto. Neither of them was virgin now, so the first finger could be
skipped. They had both taken and been taken, so holding back was not
an option. Naruto pushed himself onto Kyuubi's fingers as they lay
kissing in the bed. They finally came back up for air, and Naruto's
moans of pleasure only helped to harden Kyuubi further if that was
possible. The fox finally found his sweet spot, and Naruto yipped
from the oversensitivity. "Kami I love you Kyuubi."</P><P>"And I you," the man replied as he drank in his lover's scent.
"You're so intoxicating; it's maddening." Kyuubi inserted his
third finger and stretched Naruto out for nearly two minutes. Naruto
wouldn't be able to be taken immediately and not be hurt unless he
was always the Uke, and that was not going to happen in either male's
mind. "Are you ready?" Kyuubi asked after stealing a quick but
deep kiss from his impossibly wonderful young wolf.</P><P>"What do you think?" Naruto asked huskily as he wrapped his arms
around his fox and left a love bite on his collar bone. "Oh
Kyuuuu," he moaned deeply as the three fingers were removed. Kyuubi
lifted him by his hips, and Naruto wrapped his ankles around Kyuubi's
abdomen. "I'm ready." Naruto bared his neck again, and Kyuubi
licked it lustfully. The fox held his hips firmly and began pressing
his erection passed the strong ring of muscle. Naruto's still
untrained body tensed a little, but it adjusted quickly enough,
allowing Kyuubi to safely continue.</P><P>"I'm in ecstasy my sweet," Kyuubi told him as Naruto wrapped
his legs around him tightly. This served to deepen Kyuubi's entry,
making them both shudder.</P><P>"Kami," was all that Naruto could say as he felt over his lover's
back. He shook and arched his back when the kitsune rubbed passed his
prostate, and Kyuubi gained all the confidence in the world. "Please
Kyuubi…again," the boy pleaded. Both of the last two times had
been grand, but this was bliss to the infinity power. Both of the
demons' bodies flowed with each other's chakra, and the pleasure
coursed through them to the point of breaking the two.</P><P>"Your tails are so beautiful my lovely Naruto," Kyuubi spoke as
he nuzzled the boy. He began thrusting into Naruto, eliciting
breathless moans and a few yips from him. Naruto contributed his own
effort and pulled Kyuubi deeper with his own legs. Every time the fox
brushed through him, waves of pleasure shot throughout his body; pain
was left in the dust.</P><P>Kyuubi began to feel his release growing close, and he took hold of
Naruto's stalwart member. "Kyuu-San," the boy moaned. Kyuubi
sped up his thrusting and matched rhythms, and Naruto began feeling
his climax nearing. He took hold of Kyuubi's face and kissed him
deeply. When they came apart for air, Naruto was finally pushed over
the edge with one extra well-placed thrust. "<B>KYUUUUBIIIII!</B>"
Naruto screamed as his body began convulsing and sent his hot seed
flying onto his and Kyuubi's chests.</P><P>Naruto's chakra flowed into his mouth, and his fangs grew larger.
<I><B>Bite! Claim your mate! Take him!</B></I> The voice rang through
Naruto's mind, but he hesitated a bit before remembering what
Kyuubi told him. Among the waves of pleasure and his seed still
flowing, Naruto leaned down and tore into the junction between
Kyuubi's neck and shoulder. His chakra tails disappeared and flowed
up through him and into the bite. All of Naruto's energy seemed to
be flowing out of him and into Kyuubi. It was a wondrous and
frightening feeling.</P><P>"Naruto!" Kyuubi yelled as the boy's internal walls took him
into his own orgasm. It was certainly a good thing that he had
soundproofed the room and set up his illusion. He heard his instincts
roaring at him to bite as his chakra flowed into his mouth, and he
felt Naruto pierce him as his seed began filling the boy. Kyuubi bit
down on Naruto's junction as well, and the taste of blood made both
of their orgasms last beyond their semen reserves. Naruto and Kyuubi
collapsed into the sheets, barely able to move from both the pleasure
and now the pain coursing through them. Naruto was the first to
remove his teeth from Kyuubi's skin and muscle, but he lost
consciousness before he could look back into Kyuubi's eyes. Said
fox removed his own teeth and looked at the wound in fright. Blood
flowed freely from it. Had he been too rough? Kyuubi unconsciously
wrapped himself and Naruto in the luckily red sheets as he leaned
down to try and clean the wound with his tongue. Kyuubi however,
blacked out and fell asleep with worry.</P><P>"Should we help them?" Temari asked in shock. "That was a <I>lot</I>
of blood Gaara. They might die; those were arteries that were
broken."</P><P>"This is normal for demons of any power level," Gaara replied
flatly. "If we ran in there now, their trust in us would
disintegrate immediately. Quote unquote, you have as much blood on
your hands from watching them as I do. Their chakra will heal them;
don't worry. Naruto has survived far worse; believe me."</P><P>"All of that blood…and they bit each other," Temari breathed.
"Is this why…humans view demons as enemies?"</P><P>"Temari, go to bed," Gaara commanded as he dispelled his third
eye. "And in the morning, act like nothing happened. Naruto will
feel very uncomfortable tomorrow, so please do this for both him and
me. Naruto would be devastated, and Kyuubi would be in a rage. When
they want to tell us that they became mates, they will, but that
security has to remain intact. Don't tell Kankuro either."</P><P>"Agreed," Temari replied instantly. They left Gaara's office
and went to bed with a feeling of worry. In the morning, no one knew
what would happen.</P><P><B>Did

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P><B>Author Notes: Welcome back one and all. I'm sorry about the
update time from the last chapter, but I will try to be much better
about that.</B></P><P><B>%%%%%%%%%%%%%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$############</B></P><P><B>Konoha:</B> Kushina always woke up early, but her sleep was
troubled, and she was exhausted. Her dream was…odd for lack of a
stronger word. Kyuubi and Naruto walked back into the village to find
that everyone was ignoring them, but they ignored her presence.
Naruto and Kyuubi were ghosts to the village, but Kushina, the one
who acknowledged them, was a ghost to them, but not the villagers.</P><P>This tore at her heart deeply. She was the last one to have love for
Naruto among humans, but he could not hear her, or rather, did not
want to. Kushina had been abandoned forever by her only son.
"Naruto," she sobbed. Kushina woke up ten minutes later to find
that her nightmare was over, but an inexplicable fear still gripped
her. The village was doing fine in its repairs, so she decided that
she would visit Naruto in the Hidden Sand Village if only for a day
or two.</P><P>"I'll allow it," Tsunade began, "on one condition. Take a
team with you; the wilds have become strangely dangerous, and Shadow
ninja have infiltrated the country borders so easily. I'm sending
Sasuke, Kiba, Sakura, and Hinata with you. Come back within twelve
days' time, or I'll send ANBU after you."</P><P>"I understand Tsunade-San," Kushina replied briefly. Her team was
quickly gathered, and they left the village without a moment's
delay.</P><P><B>Suna:</B> Naruto was the first to wake up. He could barely lift
his head; his body just wouldn't respond. The memories of the
previous night hit him like a ton of bricks, and he frantically got
up and looked down at Kyuubi to find his chest simply caked in dried
blood. "Kyuubi!" he yelled. "Wake up. Please wake up!" Naruto
tried his best to shake Kyuubi awake, but his strength simply wasn't
there.</P><P>Kyuubi woke up from hearing Naruto's screams, and the first sight
that greeted him was Naruto's own torso covered in dried blood.
"Kami, Naruto you're hurt," he commented. Naruto turned ghostly
white when he looked and saw his own condition. After looking back at
Kyuubi, his eyes rolled up, and he fainted. "Oh no. Naruto!"
Kyuubi then noticed his own shoulder. "Holy shit!" he yelled.
Kyuubi followed suit and collapsed next to Naruto.</P><P>Another ten minutes later, Kyuubi woke Naruto up. "Just calm down
Naruto," he told the boy.</P><P>"How can I calm down when we're both something like minced meat?"
he yelled angrily. "I can't believe I did this to you," he said
much more quietly.</P><P>"Our instincts guided us," Kyuubi began as he grabbed Naruto's
arm. "While this might seem really bad at first glance, I don't
think it is. Does your shoulder sting like sliced flesh, or is it
just sore?"</P><P>Naruto moved his left arm to realize that he had complete control and
that there wasn't much pain except for the dried blood pulling his
skin. "You see?" Kyuubi asked. "We'll lick each other off,
because I doubt we have the energy to take a shower and remain
conscious."</P><P>"A-alright," the blond replied as he strained himself to get
close enough to the fox-man. "We're still attached." Kyuubi
drew himself out quickly, and both men had to cover their mouths.
"Kami. Let's put pants on at least." Kyuubi and Naruto barely
had any chakra left, so pants were all they could manage.</P><P>It seemed to take an eternity for the two to clean each other off,
but no one showed up at their door. Gaara had made sure that no one
disturbed them, and he even came up with several good reasons so as
to extinguish suspicions. "The bite mark is still there," Naruto
commented as he wiped the blood away from his lips.</P><P>"But more importantly, we need to look at the symbols," Kyuubi
told him. "This is gonna be tough, but we need to get into the
bathroom." Naruto groaned, but the two made it in after about five
minutes of shaky walking. It was like they were toddlers all over
again. "It's because we used up all of our chakra in making the
marks and healing the wounds," Kyuubi told an annoyed Naruto.</P><P>Both of them were shocked and overjoyed when they saw the marks they
had received. In blazing red, Naruto received the mark for eternal
beloved. In a midnight blue, Kyuubi had the symbols for treasured
soul written on his shoulder junction. They teared up and hugged each
other like never before, and this action caused them to lose balance
and fall sideways onto the bathroom floor. It was a good thing that
there was a good mat where their heads hit.</P><P>"We are mates Naruto, now and forever," Kyuubi said joyously.
"Those words are the ones chosen by your soul to describe your
eternal partner in an emotional and profound way. They encompass
every aspect of the qualities you see in that person. These words on
our shoulders are the physical manifestation of our bond. I am
honored endlessly to be your mate, and I love you. Thank you Naruto."</P><P>"I am your beloved?" Naruto asked.</P><P>"Now and forever. Eternally," Kyuubi replied. "And you treasure
me because of the relationship we had for seventeen years and that I
am so close to you. This mark is perfect Naruto, just like you."
Naruto cried openly out of joy. "I am yours forever Naruto, for to
no other shall I give this love. I pledge my body to you and only
you."</P><P>"And I promise that I will remain equally faithful for all of
time," Naruto replied. "Now, how are we gonna go about today if
we are so freaking exhausted?"</P><P>"Good question," Kyuubi replied as he thought it through. "If
we were in the demon realm, this wouldn't be a problem. In fact,
we'd be treated as royalty, because you are the second king of the
entire demon world now. We need food; I know that much."</P><P>"Kyuubi, Naruto?" Gaara called from the door leading into the
bedroom.</P><P>"Oh crap," Naruto said aloud.</P><P>"Don't worry," Kyuubi replied as he got himself up. "Let me
try and work things out." Kyuubi put his right hand over his left
shoulder-neck junction and weakly walked into their room. "Yes
Gaara-Sama?" he asked breathily.</P><P>"I was going to invite you down for a feast, but now I'm more
concerned with you two. Where is Naruto?" he asked.</P><P>"Just tell him Kyuu," Naruto called as he got on all fours.
"Knowing Shukaku, Gaara will probably know what we're talking
about."</P><P>Kyuubi was stunned and at a loss. Should he really divulge this
secret so quickly? "If you're sure," Kyuubi called back. He
lowered his arm to reveal the stunning mark Naruto had left on him.
Gaara's eyes were filled with wonder. He knew what this was, but he
had never seen one. "This is a mate's mark," Kyuubi told him
quietly, interrupting his train of thoughts. "Naruto and I became
mates just last night."</P><P>Gaara needed the right words, fast. "I'm really happy for you
guys," he said genuinely. <I>That was too cheesy,</I> he thought to
himself. Kyuubi seemed concerned that Gaara would be disgusted by
this. He was wondering if Gaara was trying to mask his true feelings.
"Really, I am happy for you two. I'm just concerned about you.
You're barely able to walk."</P><P>"You mentioned a feast?" Naruto asked as he leaned on the door
frame. Gaara nodded. "We'll make it downstairs, but don't tell
anyone else. I'm trusting you, Gaara-San." Both redheads were
stunned; Naruto had put San at the end of Gaara's name for extreme
emphasis.</P><P>"I understand completely Naruto-San, Kyuubi-San," Gaara replied.
"How about you take some of my chakra so you can put shirts on and
make it downstairs?" Both demons nodded, and Gaara went through ten
hand signs before his chakra flowed from him and into the two newly
mated demons.</P><P>"That will suffice," Kyuubi finally told the Kazekage as he
summoned a jacket. "Hey, the snow is gone." Naruto looked outside
and frowned.</P><P>"Ya," Gaara began. "And now all sorts of herbs and other plants
are growing around the oasis. It's still barely seventy degrees
though, so it shouldn't be too hot. Shall we go?" Naruto summoned
a plain orange t-shirt before following them out and shutting the
door.</P><P>"You might want to get those sheets laundered Gaara," Naruto told
him quietly. No one was around, but he wanted to be sure. "Even
though they're red, the blood won't make for a very good sleeping
surface."</P><P>"The sheets will be replaced by the end of the day," Gaara told
them before they entered his hall. "Eat as much as you want; I'd
like to honor the occasion, but this will have to do." Kyuubi's
and Naruto's mouths watered at the sight of so many different
foods. "Try the mango gelatin, but stay away from the one that has
floating red chunks in it. That one is spicy."</P><P>"Then Kyuubi can have my portion," Naruto replied. They sat down
next to each other along with Temari and Kankuro. "Thanks for the
quick boost by the way Gaara," he told the redhead quietly.</P><P>"Good morning you two," Temari said cheerfully. "Did you get a
good night's sleep?"</P><P>"You don't have to hide it," Naruto told her. Temari looked
confused, but something in the back of her mind kept yelling at her
to run. "You didn't think I'd never find out about your peeping
sessions, did you?" Everyone around him, including Kyuubi froze. "I
have extremely acute chakra sensory abilities, remember? Personally,
I think you should be ashamed of yourself for spying, but you haven't
blabbed your mouths off, so I don't mind much."</P><P>"You were…" Kankuro began before Temari clapped her hand
fiercely over his mouth. Many people in the hall turned to this and
smirked. Kankuro was always a blabbermouth, so a juicy secret had
just been given to the worst possible keeper.</P><P>"I will skin you if you tell anyone," Temari warned with death
sitting in her eyes. Kankuro's face drained of color, and he nodded
before sitting down.</P><P>"How long did you know they had been spying?" Kyuubi asked
Naruto.</P><P>"They spied on us from the first night on, but Temari and Gaara
don't seem to find us revolting, so there is no need to leave or
wipe their memories. I'll deal with Kankuro though," Naruto told
him sternly. "I know there's no way he can be trusted.
Temari-San?" Naruto asked. She turned to look him in the eyes. "May
I <I>borrow </I>your brother afterwards?"</P><P>"Certainly," Temari said flatly and approvingly. "You can't
be trusted, and you find this disgusting anyway, so he'll wipe your
memory of this conversation, and we'll all be fine." Kankuro
looked reluctant, but there was no escaping Temari's rule.</P><P>"This isn't very spicy at all," Kyuubi said out of
disappointment. "Oh well, maybe some sand monkey ribs later will do
the trick." Naruto laughed inwardly, but he was more concentrated
on his own food. After devouring most of what was originally set on
the table, Naruto and Kyuubi were stuffed. They did feel a bit more
energetic though. "Where can we go that no one will disturb us?"
Kyuubi asked.</P><P>"Just come up to my office," Gaara replied as he caught an
escaping Kankuro in his sand. "You're coming too." Gaara
carried Kankuro in a floating sand cocoon up the stairs as Kyuubi and
Naruto followed.</P><P>"This won't take much more than a second with the Kikánugan,"
Naruto told them once they were safely in the Kazekage's office.
"Keep his eyes open for me," he asked Kyuubi. "Stay still and
this will be over quickly enough."</P><P>After about 30 seconds of Naruto deleting Kankuro's memory, he
created a conversation that was completely off the subject and
implanted that memory in place of the old one. "Done," Naruto
told them as Kankuro temporarily lost consciousness. "He'll wake
up thinking he fell asleep during one of your lectures Temari-San."</P><P>Kyuubi and Naruto left the office calmly and went outside to do who
knows what. "Kyuubi," Naruto began. "My body's already
feeling flushed and hot again. Will it be like this every day?"</P><P>"It will get more and more intense until Mating Season ends, but
you will feel the effects of your heat during the day, yes," the
redhead replied. "And since this is your first heat, these next
three weeks will probably be the worst in your whole life."</P><P>"Nothing could be worse than my childhood," the blond replied
solemnly. "Do you maybe want to go for a swim in the oasis?"
Kyuubi pictured it, and it turned him on at first, but he suppressed
those lustful thoughts.</P><P>"Sure," he said quietly. "It will help keep you cooled off.
Should we go back to our room to change or is there a place to go
change?" Naruto tugged him back into the Kage Mansion, and he led
them back up to their room. "Well, that's one way to tell me."</P><P>"I have no idea how to create a towel, so could you handle that for
me?" Naruto asked as he dispelled his clothes and summoned a pair
of knee-length, solid black trunks along with a pair of blood-red
sandals.</P><P>"Sure; I think I know that one," Kyuubi told him as he summoned a
pair of bright fire trunks. "Oh, now I remember." He summoned a
blue towel with the design of a ten-tailed wolf for himself and one
of a nine-tailed fox for Naruto.</P><P>"That's amazing Kyuu," Naruto told him. "How do you make
stuff like this? I mean, anyone can come up with illusions, but how
would you go about making one of these from cloth and thread? For
that matter, how do demons go about making clothes?"</P><P>"We know many techniques that humans can only dream of figuring out
Naru-Kun," Kyuubi began. "Demons wear clothes; rest assured
Naruto, but the weavers enchant them so that they do not tear from a
transformation. In fact, the clothes kind of disappear when you are
in full demon form and reappear on your body when you go back into
human form."</P><P>"I'd probably suck at making clothes, but I wish I could make you
some that were as good as these towels are in detail," Naruto told
him. Kyuubi kissed him lovingly, and both of them felt their marks
react, sending a feeling of complete acceptance through them and just
destroying all other thoughts for a brief moment. "That was…"
Naruto began, but he couldn't find the words. His eyes were wide,
but not from fear.</P><P>"Incredible," Kyuubi finished for him as he stroked his mate's
cheek softly. "This bond, it tells me you feel insignificant
Naruto. Why?" Naruto's face drained of color, and his mind fell
apart. His thoughts were laid bare to Kyuubi, and that frightened
him. "Kami, Naruto I'm sorry." It was too late. Naruto fell to
his knees, and the emotional rampage surged through Kyuubi.
Everything his mate felt, Kyuubi felt. Their marks glowed violently
as Naruto shook with troubling thoughts. "I didn't mean to
intrude on your thoughts Naruto. Forgive me. It just…came to me."
He leaned down and comforted his distressed mate with all of his
might.</P><P>The thoughts simply surged through them both with no signs of
stopping. Kyuubi's and Naruto's minds merged, and Kyuubi was
terrified. <I>I'm so worthless,</I> Naruto's mind spoke out. It
wasn't Naruto thinking this, it was his subconscious. "No
Naruto," Kyuubi called to him. "You are precious to me." <I>I
don't deserve his love.</I> "I made this bond with you because of
how much your love means to me." <I>I'm just a burden.</I>
Kyuubi's heart was torn in two. "Stop this Naruto, please," he
cried. "You're not insignificant. You're not worthless. You're
not a burden. You, Uzumaki Naruto, are my mate, my life partner."
The thoughts calmed, but they still echoed in his mind. "You could
never be a burden to me. I, as your mate, should care for you. You
would do the same for me. Think of your music," the fox commanded.
"No one, demon or human, has ever figured out how to do that. You
know such a beautiful way to show your love to me, but I don't know
of one for myself that is anywhere near as amazing."</P><P>"Kyuubi," Naruto breathed as he held onto the fox's arms. The
degrading thoughts finally shut up, and Kyuubi kissed Naruto
lovingly. "My abilities pale in comparison to you. And you have
expressed your love to me countless times by staying by me and
comforting me and countless other things. You've made my life
livable. I could never give you a gift as grand."</P><P>"Your emotions Naruto, your love is enough," the redhead told him
as he purred and nuzzled the blond. "I would be greedy to ask for
anything more. I am loved by the most hurt creature on Earth, and I
could think of no greater love. If you wish to learn weaving, you
have many years ahead of you, but don't ever think that you are
insignificant. Mates hold each other in the highest esteem as we are
now, but they are not supposed to think of themselves badly. After
all, without both, how can there be that respect between the mates?
Mates are two pieces that fit together perfectly like a puzzle, but
each one is a complex puzzle in his or her own right. We fit together
because we have such closeness and the ability to understand each
other, but I am complicated, and Kami knows you are."</P><P>"I apologize for worrying you, my mate," Naruto said quietly as
he rested his head on the fox's chest. "When Mating Season is
over, would you mind taking me into the demon world?"</P><P>"I knew you'd ask eventually, and I would be glad to, but you
need to learn about demon society a bit," Kyuubi told him as he
stroked Naruto's mane. "The first thing to know is that you are
one of two kings who rules over the demon world. As the king of the
Bijuu and all demons living on this plane of existence, you have a
say in what happens in our true home. The other king handles most if
not all of the affairs of the main demon realm. Our current king who
has ruled justly for thirty-six-hundred years is named Zant. He has
seven tails, and he is kind-hearted like you. On top of that, he
isn't much into noble practices like elegant robes and fancy this
and that. His treasury is devoted to the people. While he dislikes
the ten-thousand formalities that other kings held in high
importance, Zant does enforce that he be given his dues and is
respected."</P><P>"He sounds like the perfect king," Naruto commented.</P><P>"He's had his occasional outburst and even one cruel streak when
his brother tried to take the throne from him, but otherwise yes,
Zant du Vestilgraden could be described as the ideal example of
royalty," Kyuubi replied</P><P><B>Note: I don't care nor do I know what "Vestilgraden"</B>
<B>means. If it is a curse in German, please ignore it. I was
thinking of Du Weldenvarden when I was writing this, and the name
just worked for me. If it means something legitimate, do tell me.</B></P><P>"Not that I'm not enjoying the moment Kyuu," Naruto began, "but
could we go to the pool? I'm getting itchy." Kyuubi could sense
that Naruto was now feeling much more self-confident, so he agreed.
They closed the door and headed straight for the center of town.
"Here's a fine spot for the towels," Naruto commented as he
laid the intricate cloths flat in the sand. "Thanks again by the
way."</P><P>"You're quite welcome," Kyuubi replied. He picked Naruto up by
his chest. "Now get in the water."</P><P>"Whoa, Kyuuuubiii," Naruto called as the fox pulled back and then
chucked him straight out above the water. Kyuubi quickly jumped high
in the air and landed next to a frazzled Naruto with a splash. Many
of the kids had to get out of their way, and Naruto picked Kyuubi up
by his hair and scolded him. "You could have hurt someone you
dimwit," Naruto chided him as he kept saying "ow, ow, ow" over
and over again. "This is why you don't act recklessly around a
pool kids," the blond told everyone who was staring. "You can
hurt yourself and others if you don't watch it. Watch where you
jump, and watch where you throw someone," he directed the last part
at Kyuubi before finally setting his crying mate in the water.</P><P>"I'm sorry Naruto-San," he said as he looked down shamefully
and futilely held his pulled hair. That sad puppy look didn't make
Naruto melt, but he did lighten up.</P><P>"You're free to go Kyuubi, but keep the rough play to a minimum,"
Naruto told him.</P><P>"How did I know I'd find you two at the center of this
commotion?" Gaara asked as he swam over. He didn't seem angry,
and he was even smiling. All of the kids looked at Gaara in wonder.
"You two never cease to cause an uproar. Oh well, as long as no one
was hurt."</P><P>"Kazekage-Sama!" the kids yelled as they crowded around him.
Gaara was soon swimming for his life as the kids chased him down.
"Come back Kazekage-Sama."</P><P>"This feels much better," Naruto commented.</P><P>"Oh crap, our marks," Kyuubi exclaimed.</P><P>"It's not like the writing will run, will it?" Naruto asked
him.</P><P>"No, but what if someone bumps it and causes you to feel you know
how?" Kyuubi asked. Naruto blushed and grimaced. "Just use a
transformation jutsu to make it disappear while we are here."
Naruto followed his command, and the mark disappeared in a puff of
smoke. "It will come back when you dispel the jutsu, so don't
worry." Kyuubi made his own mark disappear, and the two swam around
lazily until Naruto came up with a challenge.</P><P>"Let's see who can swim deeper," he suggested. Kyuubi smirked.</P><P>"There's no way you're gonna win this," he warned. "On
three. 1…2…<B>3</B>!" Naruto could swim much faster than
Kyuubi, but he didn't have the depth training that the fox had. The
oasis was fifty feet deep, but there were fail safes set up to rescue
anyone drowning and whisk them right to shore and to a lifeguard.
After going twenty-two feet down, Naruto could go no further due to
the pressure on his ears, and he conceded as Kyuubi went down another
ten feet.</P><P>They swam back up slowly, and Naruto felt lightheaded as he broke the
surface. "You did damn well for your first try," Kyuubi told him.
"But you need to go to the point where your ears hurt a little and
gradually work your way passed that point so that you don't hurt
yourself. Your lungs also need to be trained to go that low so that
they don't collapse."</P><P>"Agreed," Naruto replied as he shook the water from his ears. "Do
demons get ear infections often?"</P><P>"Luckily no," the fox told him. "Our immune systems can handle
nearly any bacteria short of botulism. We can treat and cure botulism
yes, but you still don't want to get it. Demon bodies can handle a
whole array of viruses too, including soar throat and strep, but we
can get colds and some really nasty parasites."</P><P>"I'll stay up here for the most part," Naruto told him. "My
body isn't flushed anymore."</P><P>"I hate to tell you this," Kyuubi began, "but by the third
week, you'll have to do this just to get it <I>down</I> to only
feeling flushed." Naruto groaned. "It's a good thing we're
mates Naruto. Otherwise, I couldn't do <I>this</I>." He reached
out and rubbed the spot he knew was where the blond's mark was
hidden. Naruto had to stifle a moan, but a feeling of calmness
overtook him as well. "During the third week, I can use your mark
to calm you during the day if it gets really bad. Since this is your
first heat, I expect it will get bad." Naruto stopped Kyuubi's
circular rubbing and took air back in. "This relaxes the entire
body, but our bond of being mates will prevent us from killing each
other with it. If it cuts your breathing off, just grab my hand and
lift it off."</P><P>"Duly noted," Naruto replied. "Shall we go dry off? I'm
getting kind of wrinkly."</P><P>"As you so wish," the kitsune told him as they began swimming
back for shore.</P><P><B>Kushina and the Gang:</B> "It's hard to believe we already
made it to the desert," the woman said as she looked out
expectantly.</P><P>"Mrs. Uzumaki," Sasuke panted. "May we please take a break?
Naruto's in good hands with Gaara; he'll survive another day."
Kiba collapsed jokingly, but he really was tired. Sakura and Hinata
were not much better off.</P><P>"I suppose we can rest for a while, and I'm sorry," Kushina
replied. The four quickly set up a tent and got into it for shade.
The hot sand under the thin plastic didn't help though. Each of
them had brought a fan specifically for this, but they had heard
about the oasis, so they brought swimsuits along too.</P><P>"So, why is Naruto out here Kushina-San?" Hinata asked shyly. "I
heard he was on a mission, but for what exactly?" Kiba and Sasuke
smirked. The dog-boy had divulged that secret to Sasuke two nights
ago in the middle of their own activities, and Sasuke loved having
dirt on the blond.</P><P>"From what Tsunade-San told me, Naruto is out here dealing with
Shukaku and a few groups of Shadow ninja that are still in the Wind
Country's territory," Kushina told them. "No one knows their
numbers, and the Village Hidden in the Sand hasn't been attacked,
but Naruto is out here to clean up basically." The woman had
practiced this many times, so the lie was not obvious at all. She
certainly knew the real reason, and she wanted to talk to Naruto
about it too along with her nightmare.</P><P>"We all know he's much stronger than Shukaku," Sasuke began.
Everyone turned and listened intently. "So why is he out here with
Kyuubi too? If he was just cleaning up and disposing of a few teams
of Shadow ninja, he'd only be out here for a week, not a month."</P><P>"Then what's your theory Einstein?" Kiba asked rudely to keep
off suspicions of him being with Sasuke. "Tsunade loves torturing
Naruto with long and nearly pointless missions, so why is this one
different?"</P><P>"You all know how the Uchiha kept bazillions of records and
historical texts right?" Sasuke asked. The other three young ninja
nodded. "I happened to be reading because Kakashi was punishing me
for going with Orochimaru, and I stumbled upon a section about the
summer solstice. That happens to be today. What was interesting about
it though relates to demons."</P><P>"You say another word further and I'll castrate you Uchiha,"
Kushina warned darkly. Sasuke nearly turned to stone from her
piercing stare. This woman had skills that put Orochimaru and him to
shame. The other three cowered in a corner, but Sakura and Hinata
were both curious now. If Kushina was this threatening about it, this
was one juicy secret. "Let's have some of the food I made," she
said more brightly.</P><P>They sat down and enjoyed a frosty salad Kushina had made from
lettuce she grew in her own garden. She had always had a green thumb
when it came to veggies, but flowers were not her strong suit. When
they finished, Kushina drove them like slaves, and they started
trudging off towards the Hidden Sand Village.</P><P><B>Naruto:</B> The blond boy dried himself off with the sizzling hot
red towel Kyuubi had given him. It was really soft, and Naruto
examined the fox in awe. It was made with silver threads, and it
glittered in the sunlight. They walked back to their room happily and
changed, and Naruto frowned as the towels disappeared in white smoke.</P><P>"We can always ask to have a couple made when we go to the demon
realm. Clothing is kinda pricey, but we are on the same monetary
system," Kyuubi informed him. "And if you take up weaving and get
really good at it, I can draw designs, and you can make them with the
thread." Kyuubi and Naruto undid the jutsu to hide their marks and
changed.</P><P>"Should we go to the Blue Moon Diner for lunch, or would you like
to go back to that other restaurant Kyuu-San?" Naruto asked
happily.</P><P>"I'm not in the mood to kill myself with spices, so the other
restaurant it is." About halfway to the restaurant, both of the
demons began feeling their heats crawling back. "I'm in the mood
for some cold sushi," Kyuubi began. "What about you?" Naruto
nodded. "One order of every six-piece sushi set in here," the fox
ordered as a waitress came and brought them menus. "Coke for me."</P><P>"I'll take a Sprite please," the blond asked. It was an
aggravating four minutes before the waitress came back with their
drinks, but both males restrained themselves. "I'll just chill
these down," Naruto said as he stuck a finger in his drink and
froze a column in the center and broke it. Kyuubi handed him his own
drink, and Naruto froze a part of his too.</P><P>"Thank you very much," Kyuubi spoke before bringing the glass to
his lips. "I can't believe I didn't notice, but you're really
adept with that Clothing Creation Jutsu. You even got it down to
keeping your wallet and ninja weapons, including your dad's
swords."</P><P>Naruto looked down to see the familiar blades attached to his belt,
and he reached out to them to make sure they were the real deal. He
felt Minato's presence, and Naruto sighed with relief. "As long
as I don't lose these swords or my money, I'll be okay," he
said.</P><P>They sat and talked about the demon realm quietly until a good ten
platters of sushi and sashimi appeared before them twenty minutes
later. Naruto's mouth was flowing like a waterfall, and Kyuubi
couldn't help but giggle. "Thank you miss," the fox said to
their waitress. "Idatakimasu." Naruto and Kyuubi dug in happily
and each took three pieces from each plate.</P><P>"I am stuffed," Naruto said satisfyingly about a half hour later.
He suppressed a burp before looking in terror at the bill. $112 and
an eighteen percent tip came out to be… <B>$130!</B> "Holy shit
Kyuubi," he exclaimed. "We can't eat like this every day or
we'll go broke." Kyuubi's jaw dropped when he saw the bill and
he nodded.</P><P>"Maybe we can do some small missions around here and make up some
of the loss," he suggested. "Gaara-Sama ought to understand."
Naruto put down the money and stared at the gaping hole in his cash.
With seven-hundred Ryou left, they needed to be careful. Eating out
was too costly for them to do it every day.</P><P>"We need to buy stuff and cook for ourselves," Naruto told him.
"If only I had learned to cook from Mom…."</P><P>"I know how to cook some stuff, but it will get repetitive after
two weeks," Kyuubi replied, making Naruto's expression rise. "Oh,
and add fifty Ryou to our total money. I still had some with me when
your dad sealed me in you." When Kyuubi thought over what he just
said, it sounded kind of depressing. It had about that effect on
Naruto. "Sorry Naru-Kun," he said genuinely. The fox handed over
his money, and Naruto happily put it in his frog.</P><P>"It's fine. I know it wasn't your fault, and Madara is dead. I
just need to move on is all." Kyuubi smiled lightly, and he sent
the message "I love you" via their marks. Naruto smiled a second
later, and Kyuubi received the same message back.</P><P>The two followed up on what Kyuubi had suggested and did some minor
missions around the village. After they had been working for most of
the day, Naruto totaled the cash to be $873, not bad considering. "I
wonder how Shukaku is doing," Naruto said aloud as they walked out
of Gaara's office. "We should go pay him a visit." Kyuubi
grabbed the cuff of his jacket, and Naruto understood why. "If he
tries anything, I'll punch his lights out."</P><P>"We'll show him our marks. That should be enough to deter him,"
Kyuubi told him quietly. They went to room 211 and found Shukaku
reading of all things. "We came by to say hello Shukaku-San," the
fox spoke happily. He and Naruto walked into the room calmly, and the
tanuki showed no signs of stopping them.</P><P>"I'm doing just fine," he told them abruptly. "Even if
Orochi-Sama isn't here, I can still pleasure myself, so I'm still
sane." Naruto looked him over. The sand demon seemed to be
irritated by his heat, but not as much as he was. Something caught
Shukaku's nose, and he sniffed the air suspiciously before his gaze
fell upon Naruto and Kyuubi. The door was shut, so he felt free to
talk. "I can smell it quite easily," he began. "You took
Naruto-Sama last night…didn't you?" It was said more accusatory
than it was asked, and Kyuubi replied by opening his jacket. Naruto
did the same, and Shukaku's eyes widened. "You already took each
other as mates?" he asked. "I bet you forced the poor boy
Kyuubi-San."</P><P>"If you say that about my chosen mate again, I'll see to it that
you never enjoy procreation again," Naruto told him as he stared
the raccoon down with steely eyes. Shukaku was unnerved for multiple
reasons. The main one was that Naruto had truly consented. That scent
hung in the air like noxious gas. Another main reason was the nature
of Naruto's threat. "If you're not going to congratulate us,
then at least show restraint and don't say anything derogatory,"
the blond ended.</P><P>"Well, that now means that every Bijuu has a mate," Shukaku said.
"At some point, I'd call a meeting to tell everyone. As I said
before, I am managing perfectly well without Orochi-Sama being here,
so you can go about your business as you see fit."</P><P>"See ya later then…Tanuki-San," Kyuubi said as he and Naruto
walked out of the room. Shukaku's anger flared for a short second,
but he smugly went back to his book.</P><P>"He's with Naruto-Sama for one week, and Kyuubi already takes him
as his mate. That's just not fair," Shukaku said into the air.
"Maybe I can get their bonds to be rendered illegitimate by the
courts back home." He dismissed the thought though. Shukaku should
be happy for both of his Bijuu friends, so what was making him so
mad?</P><P>"I don't think he'll try anything again," Kyuubi commented as
they went back into their room. "Look, they've already replaced
the sheets." Naruto smiled. A wintery scene played out on the
bedspread. It was getting late, and the air temperature wasn't
dropping. "Are you in the mood to eat Naruto; I'm not."</P><P>"I'm not hungry at all, and that's weird," the blond replied.
"Is it just me, or is the desert still really hot?" Kyuubi
nodded. "I'm gonna cool the room down. Do you mind?"</P><P>"Not at all," the fox replied. Naruto frosted the window over and
made icicles hang in diagonals away from the bed. "It can't be
later than seven-thirty."</P><P>"This is sort of embarrassing," Naruto said from behind Kyuubi.
Three of his chakra tails had appeared, and Kyuubi could smell his
arousal in the air. As he went through his safety jutsu, two of
Kyuubi's own red chakra tails appeared. "Normally, I can restrain
myself, but my body is screaming at me."</P><P>"Then quiet it," Kyuubi told him as he closed the distance
between him and Naruto. He brought Naruto into a passionate kiss and
unzipped the blond's jacket. "As mates, we are both guaranteed
full access to each other's bodies. Although that wasn't a
problem. My point is that we have yet to do this…<I>properly</I>."</P><P>"Don't jump ahead of yourself," Naruto told the fox as he
grabbed his right hand. "Are you forgetting that it is <I>your</I>
turn tonight?" Kyuubi was a bit taken aback, but then Naruto kissed
him and ground their clothed erections together. He couldn't help
but moan into the kiss, and Naruto became more confident.</P><P>"Wait, kid," Kyuubi barely got out. Naruto released him, but this
had better be good. "We should probably lock the door." The boy
did what the fox suggested out of annoyance, but he then resumed his
attack on Kyuubi. He took off the man's jacket completely, and he
began feeling Kyuubi's abdominal muscles through his shirt. "You
do have quite the talent for this."</P><P><B>Kushina and the Gang:</B> "We're about fifteen miles from the
village," the woman commented. "But there's no way we'll make
it before dawn. Set up camp here."</P><P>"With pleasure," Kiba moaned. They had been trudging since seven
that morning, and they had only stopped a few times to have lunch and
relieve themselves. The dog-boy and Sasuke set up the tent, and
Sakura set up a fire using wood gathered beforehand. Hinata found a
small underground spring with the Byakugan and dug it up. "The
tent's done," Kiba called. Sasuke put his hand over the boy's
mouth.</P><P>"Later tonight, we'll tell the girls the truth," the raven
spoke quietly and deviously. Kiba got a glint in his eye and nodded.
"All we have to do is put down our sleeping bags and we're good
to go," he called out after removing his hand from Kiba's mouth.
Sasuke caught Sakura away from the campfire and told her to meet them
out here after they were sure Kushina was asleep. Sakura told Hinata
the plan as well, and she agreed out of curiosity.</P><P>"This is a soup that Naruto enjoyed very much," Kushina said
happily. The four younger ninja groaned. "Don't worry. It isn't
ramen broth." This made them all sit down and patiently wait for
the woman's soup to heat up over the roaring fire. "It's a
little spicy, but not very."</P><P>"I wonder how happy Naruto will be to see us," Kiba spoke aloud
before taking in a spoonful. "Whoa, this blows my mom out of the
water."</P><P>"Knowing Naruto, he should be very excited, and thank you
Kiba-Kun," the woman replied. "I put plenty of chicken and
zucchini in it, so it's healthy too."</P><P>"We should serve this back at the hospital," Sakura began. "This
has much more nutritional value than some of the stuff the cafeteria
serves. I haven't seen a single Shadow ninja all day. Did Naruto
already get them all or what?"</P><P>"We're not too far from a battle sight actually," Hinata told
them as she twiddled her fingers.</P><P>"Ooo, where?" Kiba asked excitedly.</P><P>"It's just over the dune," the girl replied sheepishly. "But
there's a bunch of blood and craters."</P><P>"Sounds kinda like Naruto's style, but the blood isn't usually
a part of that," Sasuke said as he thought it over. "We might as
well go see what remains." Sasuke got up, and the others followed
suit. Without their packs, it wasn't as laboring to keep walking.
"Well, that certainly was battle," the raven spoke when they
reached the top. Hinata ran out and dug up a headband from the sand
next to a cavern also made of sand. "This belonged to a
Shadow-ninja, no doubting that," Sasuke told them as he looked it
over. "Should we follow those footprints Kushina-San?"</P><P>"Naruto's been here," Hinata told them sternly. "There's
still some residual ice chakra over there, and it points in the
direction of those prints."</P><P>"Then we will follow them," Kushina determined. It was a half
hour until the reached the hideout, and they noticed a bent metal
door in the sand. "Well, that looks promising," she mused. They
walked down into the hideout and were frightened by the scene in the
first room they came to.</P><P>"Naruto went nuts," Kiba said aloud in disbelief. "This guy's
throat's been torn out…with teeth…<I>big</I> teeth. They've
been clawed to death."</P><P>"This jutsu," Kushina began. "It's used for sealing demons."
Everyone gasped and examined the writing on the floor. "They got
what they deserved."</P><P>"It wasn't just Naruto," Hinata told them. "There were two
other demons here, and one was heavily wounded. One was the Kyuubi,
but I don't know this other one. This happened early yesterday
going by the state of the blood."</P><P>"Then the dobe really is working?" Sasuke asked. "I never would
have thought. Every single one of them is a Shadow ninja. Naruto even
broke this headband with his bare hand. I recognize the claw pattern.
Who knew he could get <I>this</I> angry and bloodthirsty?"</P><P>Kushina took a snapshot of the jutsu before taking them all back out.
Sasuke kept the broken headband. About an hour later, Kushina was
fully asleep, and the four silently crept out of the tent and back in
front of the campfire. "Okay, I brought you all out here to explain
that thing from before," Sasuke began as he double-checked on their
sleeping guardian. "Today is the summer solstice, and Naruto and
the Kyuubi were sent out here a couple days before." Everyone
nodded. "It just so happens that the summer solstice marks the
beginning of Demon Mating Season." Hinata turned beet red, and
Sakura paled and became angered at his perversion. Kiba got on a
devious smile.</P><P>"Do you mean to tell me that Naruto, our innocent little
hyperactive Naruto is getting it on with the Kyuubi even as we
speak?" he asked humorously. Sasuke nodded and smirked. Kiba had to
cover his mouth to muffle his laughter, and Sakura punched both him
and Sasuke for thinking such things.</P><P>"Naruto's had a crush on me for years," the pink-haired girl
began. "I doubt he'd just instantly go at it with the Kyuubi.
That's too quick to make sense or for them to really build a
relationship. Not to mention, they're both guys, so Naruto would be
disgusted by it."</P><P>"I guess you two didn't get the memo that Naruto was seen <I>kissing</I>
the Kyuubi by Konohamaru not three days before he left?" Sasuke
asked. Sakura was silenced, and Hinata seemed to withdraw into
herself. "I never would have guessed it before, but I think Naruto
left the village temporarily to get some privacy to deal with his own
emotional roller coaster."</P><P>"Ya, turning gay, that's gotta be tough," Kiba finally said
with a small smile. That word, that ugly little word "gay" was
all that Sakura needed to unleash Hell on the poor boy.</P><P>"Like you of all people would ever be able to understand Naruto,"
the pink-haired harpy spoke threateningly as she picked him up by the
front of his jacket. Sakura was taller than Kiba by about two inches,
but she was also way stronger. "I honestly don't care if he is
with the Kyuubi right now. Have you seen another demon around besides
Kyuubi? It isn't like he has much choice. I don't think he would
be the kind of guy to just find a whore and deal with his hormones
that way." Kiba and Sasuke giggled, and Sakura punched them both
again. "Idiots. When you think about it, this is probably just a
temporary thing until Naruto can get married. Kiba, you ought to know
what happens when one of your dogs goes into heat."</P><P>"Ya, I know from multiple perspectives. Your point?" he asked
quietly.</P><P>"Demons go into heat during this period; I know that much," she
retorted. "That means, their desirous, they're desperate, and
demons form temporary relationships to keep level heads during Mating
Season."</P><P>"I could say you were right if not for the fact that Naruto was
kissing Kyuubi three days <I>before</I> Mating Season," Sasuke told
her. "I don't know. It <I>might</I> be temporary, but I don't
think it is."</P><P>"Says the sly pervert," Sakura retorted as she lowered a
frightened Kiba to his feet. <I>I know more about this than you do,
Sakura,</I> Sasuke thought to himself. "There is a certain amount
of trust that is needed before demons just jump into rutting. Naruto
would only do it with someone he knew he could trust completely, and
the Kyuubi was sealed inside him for seventeen and a half years. I'm
saying that Naruto trusts Kyuubi enough to expose his body, not that
he fell in love with the fox."</P><P>"Well, you've each got pieces of the story right," Kushina said
as she leaned over Sasuke and frowned. His body and mind froze. Would
Naruto's crazily protective mother really follow through with her
threat? "You're safe, for now," she said quietly. "Is Hinata
alright?" The Hyuuga was breathing deeply to calm herself, but this
was striking news to her. After all, this was <I>her</I> crush they
were talking about.</P><P>"I'm gonna trust you guys to still accept Naruto when I've
finished explaining," she began. "I've been having nightmares
involving him being shunned by the village when he comes back, but
the worst part is that he shuns me." Everyone's eyes widened.</P><P>"He wouldn't do that Kushina-San," Sakura reassured her.
"Naruto's way more sensitive than that."</P><P>"It's the real reason that I brought you guys out here," the
woman replied as she sat down. "Naruto and Kyuubi are in fact
staying in the Hidden Sand Village because of it being Mating
Season."</P><P>"Score one for the boys," Sasuke spoke. Sakura glared at him
before turning back to Kushina.</P><P>"I was with Naruto for all of a month, and he runs off on me,"
the woman began again. "One thing you all need to realize is that
Kyuubi really does care about Naruto, and Naruto cares about him. The
first day Kyuubi was staying in our house, Naruto fell off the side
of Minato's bed, and I came running to make sure he was okay. The
thing is, I was more concerned that Kyuubi might have been the one to
hurt him. It didn't seem innocent at the time, but he was trying to
keep Naruto in the dark at the time."</P><P>"What did Kyuubi do?" Hinata asked finally.</P><P>"You know what happens to boys when they see a pretty girl?"
Kushina asked. The four were overtaken by a sense of awkwardness,
especially Kiba and Sasuke. "Kyuubi physically tried to hide it,
but I had seen the movement, so I confronted him when Naruto put his
illusion jacket on the clothesline to dry it off. I warned him that I
would do anything to protect Naruto, even if it meant finding a way
to kill Kyuubi or turn the entire village against him. Naruto seemed
to really care for him though, and Kyuubi did his absolute best to
play by my rules, so I brought him outside in private so that Naruto
wouldn't hear."</P><P>"Kyuubi explained some really significant things about demon
society, and he confessed that he had feelings for Naruto, but he
doubted Naruto would ever love him back the same way."</P><P>"I know it was Madara who made Kyuubi go on a rampage right after
Naruto was born, but Kyuubi fell <I>in love</I> with Naruto?"
Sasuke asked disbelievingly.</P><P>"There is one thing you definitely need to understand before I
explain anything else," Kushina began. She cleared her throat and
searched for an easy way to explain it, but being blunt was best in
this case. "Demons…don't make prejudices or distinctions when
it comes to taking bed-partners or mates. What I mean is that…to
them…homosexuality doesn't exist. It's deemed natural,
acceptable, and legitimate in their society. Since humans view demons
as their enemies, we developed aversions for such practices as
same-sex couples."</P><P>"So it's completely equal rights and no hating on guys or girls
being together?" Kiba asked in awe.</P><P>"I'm saying," Kushina began, "that Naruto…fell in love with
Kyuubi too." Everyone was shocked. Sakura had her hand over her
mouth, Kiba was dumbstruck, Sasuke's eyes were slightly wider than
usual, and Hinata lowered her head in disbelief. "I was unsure
about how you guys would take it, so I had planned on waiting until
we got to the village and asked Naruto himself. The thing of it is,
the older generations in our village would view this so badly. You
absolutely must keep this a secret from the older adults until Naruto
and Kyuubi decide to reveal it for themselves. I'd never forgive
myself if I hurt Naruto that way. It'd be betraying his trust, and
it would ruin his view of life. I don't honestly know if Naruto and
Kyuubi have gone 'all the way' yet, but Kyuubi promised me that
he would completely restrain himself until Naruto is ready. He was
born a human, so he did have insecurities about it, especially after
so quickly turning into a demon."</P><P>"I hope Naruto's alright," Sakura mused. "He can beat the
daylights out of Kyuubi if he needs to, but I hope he hasn't lost
it emotionally. This has got to be torture."</P><P>"Naruto loves Kyuubi because he is so close to him," Kushina
continued. "I just feel like I should be there for him."</P><P>"We need to get to sleep if we want to keep up with the dobe
tomorrow," Sasuke said as he got up and walked toward the tent.
"He'll be fine; trust me." They all crawled back into their
sleeping bags and fell asleep hoping that tomorrow would bring good
news.</P><P><B>Naruto:</B> "We never did much of that before," the blond
commented as he held a naked Kyuubi in his arms. They had finished
cleaning up after Kyuubi's climax, and Naruto simply held his mate
close as their marks echoed feelings of love and closeness and
intimacy.</P><P>"Every demon and human would beg for you to touch them so…my
Naruto," Kyuubi told the boy as he panted. "If I didn't
personally know how many times you have had sex before, I'd say you
have eons of experience. Your instincts impress me to no end."
Kyuubi nuzzled Naruto before stealing a light and loving kiss from
him. "If only we could remain like this for all of eternity. I must
say Naruto, I doubt Nibi has the sexual aptitude that you do."</P><P>"Kyuubi," Naruto giggled. He hugged his mate closely, and their
marks touched, sending shivers down both of them. "I love you."</P><P>"I love you too my beloved," the fox replied. Their marks glowed
a soft white, and a small intricate design appeared around the
original writing. "We have already formed a reaffirmation of our
bond," Kyuubi said softly as he traced the red, orange, and yellow
flames that surrounded the mark on Naruto. "These are rare, but
this is only our first day as mates. This is incredible Naruto."</P><P>"Are these permanent as well?" he asked. Kyuubi nodded. "Yours
is of dancing winds. What does mine look like?"</P><P>"It looks like fire," Kyuubi told him softly. "These represent
that love is slowly kindled and grows into something very large and
powerful. The wind probably means that we will be brought many
places, and that our love will endure. Some believe that these marks
can describe the future to a point. This makes them very valuable for
prophets."</P><P>"I will never be able to show you just how much I love you Kyuubi,"
Naruto said quietly. Kyuubi kissed him deeply and relayed comfort to
Naruto to reassure him that Kyuubi was not at all disappointed or
displeased.</P><P>"If you truly do not feel confident in the way you express your
love to me, then it means that you truly treasure me above all else
and would do anything for me," Kyuubi replied. "Rest assured
though. I love you, and we have many years ahead of us. As I
mentioned before, if you wish to take up the loom and learn how to
make clothing, you have the time to learn it." Kyuubi became even
quieter. "If you wish to sire a child, we have time." Naruto
teared up out of happiness and kissed Kyuubi deeply as he pulled the
covers over them. After they broke from the kiss, Naruto and Kyuubi
fell asleep looking into each other's eyes.</P><P>"They took three times as long as usual," Gaara commented. "Those
marks of theirs are beautiful too…like artwork."</P><P>"Naruto has skills," Temari spoke as she drooled over the images
in her mind of his ministrations sending Kyuubi into a frenzy. "He
looks so happy with Kyuubi too. Mates, that's so romantic."</P><P>"I don't think I'd mind being with another dude," Kankuro
told them. He was tied down so that he couldn't run. Temari wanted
to shut him up for good and made him watch. The only thing was that
Kankuro stopped resisting about ten minutes in, and he had been
amazed by the way Naruto and Kyuubi "went at it." It wasn't
just lustful or forceful. Sure, lust was definitely there, but that
was just fuel, not the main act. What had surprised him most was the
fact that Kyuubi had never said "ouch," and he never asked Naruto
to stop or slow down. The whole session was both demons listening to
each other and showing restraint while satisfying their sexual needs.</P><P>"Come on, it's time for bed," Gaara told his siblings. He
untied Kankuro, and they each went of to his or her respective room
to sleep.</P><P><B>Author Notes: Thank you for reading. Review Please. I don't get

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P><B>Author Notes: Welcome back one and all. I'm sorry about the
update time from the last chapter, but I will try to be much better
about that.</B></P><P><B>%%%%%%%%%%%%%^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$############</B></P><P><B>Kushina and the Gang:</B> The blue-eyed mistress got the group up
at six, a fact that none of the four young ninja liked. "If you
want to catch Naruto, you don't have much choice other than getting
up before he does, because it's straight to breakfast by nine and
off he goes, not to be seen again until seven-thirty for dinner."</P><P>"Uuuugh," Kiba groaned. "He better love us for this."</P><P>"Agreed," Sasuke yawned. "Okay, fifteen miles to the village
over three hours equals five miles per hour. I can do that." He had
the tent undone and in a pack five minutes later, and the others were
ready to go.</P><P>"Let's aim for at least seven miles an hour," Kushina chimed.
"If we're there to greet him when he wakes up, he'll be even
more surprised." The others didn't really care about a slight
increase in pace, but Naruto's mother didn't know the difference
between 7 and 20 miles per hour.</P><P>"This is not seven miles an hour Kushina-San," Kiba whined.
Sasuke just "hmphed," and the girls didn't complain at all. The
dog-boy was ignored by the woman. Her focus was clear, but she pushed
them to their limits. Even Sasuke with his endurance training found
her pace to be grueling. How on Earth could she keep going?</P><P>When they came over the top of a dune forty-five minutes later, the
group spotted the Hidden Sand Village. "Just eight miles to go,"
the woman commented cheerfully.</P><P><B>Gaara:</B> He had awoken like normal and taken a shower as dawn
came over the village, but something nagged at the back of his head.
"Oh yeah," he yawned. "I have to test that Nagato kid later for
Naruto-San. I wonder if Temari is available." He came into his
office to find a fresh pile of paperwork. "Grrr," he began. "Some
days I really wish I wasn't the Kazekage. At least I have Naruto
and Kyuubi lighting up my days."</P><P>"Hey bro," Kankuro greeted him ten minutes later. Gaara nodded,
but he didn't raise his eyes from the papers in his hands. "Should
I wake up the sleeping beauties?"</P><P>"You do and Temari will kill you for invading their privacy," the
redhead replied. Kankuro grimaced and thought it over once. "Or do
you remember them falling asleep naked last night?"</P><P>"That was kind of why…so it could be a joke," the puppet master
explained.</P><P>"You're not funny little brother," the wind-user herself told
him as she walked into Gaara's office. "Scouts have reported five
approaching Leaf Ninja. None of their identities have been confirmed
though."</P><P>"That's strange," Gaara began. "Tsunade-Sama didn't send me
news of them coming here. Or a Shadow ninja might have blown the
messenger bird out of the sky. Either way, guide them in when they
arrive, but get their identities. We had a spy disguised as an
immigrant from the Hidden Mist Village discovered yesterday. It could
be replacements."</P><P>"You got it," his sister replied. As she went for the door
though, Gaara remembered.</P><P>"Sorry Nee-Chan, but could you maybe test this guy's mettle
later?" the redhead asked politely. "Naruto brought him back
after destroying a Shadow ninja hideout. Apparently, this Nagato kid
is fifteen or sixteen and has no known parents. Naruto-San also
searched his mind, so he's not a threat."</P><P>"This ought to be fun," his sister mused as she looked at the
file. "Three-o'-clock sharp in the Chuunin Barracks. Tell him if
he's late he has to treat me to dinner."</P><P>"Very well then, I expect our visitors will be here by about eight
if the scouts just spotted them," Gaara told her. "If they are
here to see Naruto, bring them to me unless you see him and Kyuubi up
and about." Temari left the room quietly, and Kankuro went off to
go train.</P><P><B>Kushina and the Gang:</B> An hour later, Kushina and her team
happily strolled up to the gate and were greeted by Temari.</P><P>"Kushina-San I recognize," she began. "Sasuke," she said more
quietly and darkly. "Hello again Sakura. You two, names," she
said abruptly to Hinata and Kiba. "I'm sorry, but with the Shadow
ninja prowling about in the desert and nearly sealing Shukaku the
other day, security is a must."</P><P>"I'm Hinata," the Hyuuga said shyly. "So that third demon was
Shukaku. We came across a massacred hideout in the desert not too far
from here. There were six dead Shadow ninja."</P><P>"I'm Inuzuka Kiba," the dog-boy said flatly. "Apparently,
Naruto's been hard at work out here."</P><P>"I figured that was why Leaf Ninja had shown up, but Gaara would
like to talk to you first," the blond told them. She signed the
papers for the five to enter the village, and in another ten minutes,
they entered Gaara's office.</P><P>"Ah, Kushina-San, how was your trip?" the redhead asked
cheerfully. Sasuke was in shock at this new happy Gaara. What had
happened to his crazy opponent from the Chuunin Exams?</P><P>"It went well Gaara-Sama," she replied.</P><P>"You enjoyed driving us like slaves," Kiba muttered. Sakura hit
him in the head, shutting him up.</P><P>"We were hoping to see Naruto, but I'm guessing it's too early
for him to wake up," the woman began again. Gaara nodded. "How
are he and Kyuubi doing?"</P><P>"They've been running around like mad taking all of the D-Rank
missions for the Genin trying to make some quick cash," the
Kazekage told her humorously. "Apparently, eating out <I>ate</I> a
hole in Naruto-Kun's money. Other than that, they've been
enjoying the desert and the…<I>oasis</I>."</P><P>"You <I>do </I>have one?" Sakura asked excitedly. Gaara nodded.
"Thank you, some rest and relaxation and swimming."</P><P>"More to my point, how have <I>they</I> been?" Kushina asked
again. Gaara blushed, and he kept gesturing toward the other four. "I
kind of explained it to them." Gaara's face drained of color, and
Temari wanted to hide under a rock.</P><P>"Well, that puts a spin on things," Gaara began. "Actually, it
is probably best that you see them for yourselves." Kiba and Sasuke
smirked, and Hinata started twiddling her fingers. "They'd be
waking up five minutes from now anyway. We might as well just go wake
them up."</P><P><B>Naruto:</B> The boy awoke feeling completely energetic, but he
couldn't help but slow down and smile when he saw his mate Kyuubi
nested in his arms. "Oh Kyuu-uu," he purred into the fox's ear.
Naruto didn't receive much response, so he began lightly chewing on
Kyuubi's ear like he had experimented the night before. This pulled
a low mewling from the fox, so Naruto gave one slightly harder bite
which finally made the redhead twitch, waking him up. "Good
morning."</P><P>"Hmm, morning Naru-Kun," he replied before Naruto felt over his
abs and gave him a loving kiss. "I smell no desire. You just wish
to lay with me?" Kyuubi asked quietly as he kept his gaze on the
wolf's eyes. Naruto nodded, receiving a happy giggle and a nuzzling
session from Kyuubi. "You're feeling quite happy today."</P><P>"Ya, and I don't know why, but I can make a reason," the blond
replied. He caressed Kyuubi's cheek as they kissed each other
again. They froze however when three knocks sounded from their door.
"Oh crap. Get dressed; hurry," Naruto said quietly and
frantically.</P><P>"You guys awake yet Naruto-San?" Gaara called.</P><P>"One sec," Naruto replied in an even and well-masked tone as his
ninja suit appeared on him. Kyuubi had a t-shirt and shorts on; it
would do. Naruto opened the door and froze as the sight of his mom
and company appeared.</P><P>Sasuke decided to break the three-second tension. "Hey dobe, miss
us?" Naruto was dumbstruck, and Kyuubi walked up and figured out
why. <I>Oh…joy,</I> he thought to himself. "You in there?"
Sasuke asked as he playfully knocked on Naruto's forehead.</P><P>"Yes, I'm here," Naruto half-laughed. "This is just…a bit
unexpected. Not that I'm not happy to see you, but why are you
here?" he asked.</P><P>"We came to see you," Kushina spoke as she hugged her son
tightly.</P><P>"You don't seem to trust me very much is more like it," Naruto
said with an accusatory smile. "It's fine though. By the way,
cooking lessons are a must." Everyone laughed at this because they
knew his financial troubles.</P><P>"I gave you a thousand Ryou," Kushina began. "How much is
left?"</P><P>"Eight-Hundred-Seventy-Three Ryou, and that was after spending
three hundred," Naruto told her.</P><P>"Well, it's not as bad as I thought it would be, but ya, cooking
lessons for you and Kyuubi," Kushina told them. "May we come in?"
Naruto looked back at the bed. It was pretty messed up, but he could
probably explain it as fighting with Kyuubi over the covers at night,
even though they never did.</P><P>"I guess," Naruto began. "Just let me fix up the bed so you all
have a place to sit." Naruto started making the bed, and he watched
for any semen stains so as to hide them. Luckily, there were none on
the outside of the sheets. It'd be worse if they were red sheets,
but sheets of any color had a bad tendency to show <I>any</I> stain.
"That'll do until house cleaning comes by later." Gaara had
shut the door, and he sat on a floating platform of sand. Everyone
else had found the various chairs around the room, leaving Naruto and
Kyuubi to sit on their own bed. "We can handle a few renegades,"
Naruto began.</P><P>"And you also know the real reason that I am here," Kushina
interjected. Naruto lowered his head in reluctant acceptance. "I've
been having nightmares about your return to the village." The boy's
head sprang back up instantly, and he wore a look of concern. "When
you came back, you and Kyuubi were shunned by the entire village, but
the worst part was that you ignored me entirely and left without
saying a word to me. I just want you to know that I won't ever stop
loving you Naruto, even though I really wasn't there for you for so
long. I think it was my own guilt eating away at me, but I needed to
reassure myself."</P><P>"You don't have to worry mom," Naruto told her. "Try to not
dream about that. You'll wreck your health. It isn't hard to see
the exhaustion." His four friends gasped. Kushina of all people was
<I>exhausted?</I> "Now, I can only guess why the four of you
followed Mom."</P><P>"Tsunade sent us with her for protection, but as fast as we were
going, there was no need," Kiba stated. Sakura hit him again, but
lighter.</P><P>"Now that we're here though," Kushina began. "We are glad
that you are doing fine. Sasuke found what remained of the Shadow
ninja you…beat up." Sasuke pulled out the split headband, and
Naruto's expression became distressed.</P><P>"That was when I rescued Shukaku and went nuts in their hideout,"
he explained as he took the pieces from Sasuke. "I let my anger get
the best of me, because this one guy was so arrogant and snobby,
worse than you Sasuke." The raven narrowed his eyes, but he
listened. "I deemed him garbage and tore out his throat with my own
teeth. I'm guessing you saw what remained of that. What scared the
crap out of me is what happened after that. There are arteries in the
neck that are simply gorged with blood. I accidentally swallowed some
of his blood, and it drove my instincts like wildfire. My body just
took over itself and hacked them all down in an instant. But it
didn't end there. I kept wanting more blood in my mouth, but Kyuubi
stopped me."</P><P>"That's a medical fact worth researching," Sakura spoke. "I'm
glad that you didn't go nuts though."</P><P>"As am I," Kyuubi interjected. "You're beating around the
bush though; we can both sense it." Naruto blushed a bit, and so
did everyone in the room. "I get it. You won't leave Naruto or me
alone until you get an answer."</P><P>Naruto had a distant look on as he unzipped his jacket. "This…is
what you mean, isn't it?" he asked quietly as he revealed the
mate's mark on his left shoulder-neck junction. Everyone in the
room paled except for Kyuubi. "Go ahead and laugh; I'm ready."</P><P>"The person who laughs at you among us is going to die," Kushina
warned with every ounce of intensity in her being as she walked over
and sat next to Naruto. "I had a feeling you would eventually, but
this soon?"</P><P>"It's permanent; there is no way back or out," Naruto said
aloud. "We're mates for life, Kyuubi and me. Does that answer
your questions?"</P><P>"That's pretty cool looking actually," Kiba commented. "The
words seem kinda cheesy, but those flames are awesome." Naruto
growled in his throat, but he didn't know why and blushed. "Whoa,
take it easy."</P><P>"I would watch what I say if I were you, boy," Kyuubi told him as
he sat down on Naruto's left. "Since you are not a demon, I
cannot expect you to understand. When a mate's mark is made, and I
have one too." Kyuubi drew his left arm out of his shirt to show
them. "When a mate's mark is made, the words etched into the
person's body profoundly encompass every characteristic that his or
her partner sees in that person. The soul chooses the word or words,
not the mind. Now think about it again." Kiba took on a surprised
look as he leaned back in his chair.</P><P>"If I may ask," Sasuke began. "How are they made?" Gaara
blushed and shifted, but no one noticed. Naruto definitely didn't
want to answer this one himself, and Kyuubi could sense his anxiety.</P><P>"Once again, if you laugh, Kushina and I will personally see to
your death," Kyuubi warned as he sent a wave of killing intent into
the air. "During procreation…a demon's instincts will at some
point call out to the person and tell him or her how to claim another
as his or her mate. Every single recorded way is known to be violent.
Ours happened to be bites at the junction between the neck and
shoulder. Both demons must consent to making the bond though, or the
mark will not take effect at all, and when the wound heals, nothing
would be left behind. Bear that in mind. Gaara-Sama helped us the
next day, and we were exhausted. Forming the bond requires a lot of
chakra, and healing from the wound or wounds takes chakra as well. We
were running on empty to the point where we could barely make it into
the bathroom to even examine the marks put on us. The words are the
original mark, but these designs surrounding them are known as
reaffirmations. They are rare in general, but getting one the day
after becoming mates is unheard of."</P><P>"You said being mates was permanent," Sakura began. "Would you
mind explaining?"</P><P>"It means that we can't simply get a divorce like in a marriage,"
Naruto began. "I know that this is awkward for you and seems
strange, but try to understand. I love Kyuubi, and becoming his mate
means that I swear to never cheat on him, and the same applies to
Kyuubi. When a mate cheats, he or she and the one cheated with are
sentenced to death as an example for all of demon society. I don't
know how anyone would find out, but I'm guessing that the marks
play a role. It is believed that every demon's duty is to protect
the bond between mates, so the one who is cheated with is sentenced
to death because of his or her consent in the matter." Naruto
paused before laying down the bottom line. "This basically means
that I can never take another, human or demon, male or female."</P><P>"That's beautiful Naruto-Kun," Hinata finally spoke. "I…I…"</P><P>"It hurts; I know Hinata," Naruto interrupted her as he walked
over and hugged her. "You still admire me, but I think this will
help. In demon society, and I think this should be applied as a
belief to humans too, if a person denies you when you ask for his or
her love, it means that this person is either not ready or is not
meant for you." Hinata teared up. "There will be another for you
Hinata, but Kyuubi and I were together since I was born. The
closeness and understanding of each other that we have is just
something I share with no one else. We will always be friends Hinata,
and I will always be proud of you, but we were not meant for each
other. You don't have to forget about me, but do not let your lost
love for me consume you." He lifted Hinata's head by her chin.
"As Kyuubi's mate, I must remain devoted and faithful. You'll
find another guy Hinata; you're beautiful and strong and talented,
and don't ever sell yourself short."</P><P>"Oh Naruto-Kun," Hinata cried as she hugged him tightly. Naruto
was completely unsure of what was safe and what wasn't, but Kyuubi
gave him the go ahead. The blond hugged Hinata back and comforted her
for several minutes, and he felt guilty about doing this to her, but
there was no way around it.</P><P>"I won't ever forget about our years back when we were Genin, and
I'll remember how you completely beat those bee-users by yourself,"
Naruto said quietly as the Hyuuga's tears slowed. "Treasure our
memories, but don't let them haunt you and weigh on you for your
whole life."</P><P>"Thank you Naruto-Kun," she ended quietly as she went back to her
seat.</P><P>"Naruto's always been the sensitive type," Kyuubi commented as
he helped the blond up. "That was very well done," he said before
doing what Naruto had asked him not to do in public before. Kyuubi
took a light and reassuring kiss from him, stunning everyone in the
room. Naruto found it embarrassing at first, but he became intrigued
as he returned the kiss and both of their marks glowed.</P><P>"Hey, they're making new designs," Kiba commented. "There's
a ring of ocean surrounding Naruto's mark now, and Kyuubi's got
what looks like tree roots." Naruto smiled as he separated from
Kyuubi, and Hinata looked down as she blushed.</P><P>"I'm sure that we won't get a third for quite a while though,"
Kyuubi spoke. "This is a reaffirmation of our bond that represents
overcoming a trial. Naruto, you overcame guilt, and I think the
circular pattern means that you will have to overcome many emotional
obstacles in your life. These roots show that our bond is strong and
that I will remain rooted to you even when you must show emotion to
others that you care about."</P><P>"That's so romantic," Sakura said, breaking up the moment as
both Naruto and Kyuubi blushed and put their tops back on completely.
"It smells like love to me." Naruto smiled as he sat back down.
"Now, from what we've been told, demons don't make prejudices
against same-sex couples." Naruto became nervous, and Kyuubi could
feel it intensely. "I think they have the right idea. You guys are
cute together."</P><P>"Thanks Sakura-Chan," Naruto said with relief. "I'm still
worried about actually going back to the Leaf Village though. Shall
we go have a light breakfast, or should we head straight for the
oasis and wait until lunch?" Naruto asked. Everyone but Kushina
replied "oasis."</P><P>"Then I'll teach Naruto about how to shop for quality ingredients
and how to cook," she began with a smile. "Kyuubi, you're
coming too."</P><P>"Yay, I get to cook my first lunch other than ramen," Naruto
yelled cheerfully. Everyone else was out the door instantly. "Some
friends," he scoffed sarcastically. "Just as a warning Mom,"
Naruto started. "Since it is now <I>actually</I> Mating Season,
Kyuu and I will need to get in the water at some point to make our
bodies shut up."</P><P>"Right after lunch," she mused as Naruto and Kyuubi walked out
the door with her. "But there is a lot to learn before we actually
start <I>cooking</I>. I brought two-hundred Ryou for myself, but I
can spare some to teach you." They went off to the market square,
and Kushina went to town. "You might want to take notes," she
warned.</P><P>Kushina first examined the carts and shops for herself; then she
asked about prices. Naruto paid as much attention as he could, but
rumors about girls shopping were true. This was boring. "Naruto,"
she called. "Be a dear and smell this grapefruit for me." Okay,
now this was just pointless and almost embarrassing, but he did what
his mother asked of him.</P><P>Upon sniffing it, Naruto found something strange. "Uh, I think it's
rotting," he said.</P><P>"Exactly," she replied before putting it back down and pissing
off the seller. "The fact that it was so soft and light worried me.
Now, what are the characteristics of this one?"</P><P>"Firm, sweet smelling, but the skin is kind of light, isn't it?"
he asked. The merchant just went to another customer, and she was
wise to do so.</P><P>"See, you know how to pick out quality fruit if you pay attention,"
his mother commented. "Now, there are two kinds of grapefruit, pink
and red. Both have distinct skin colors, and the flavors are a bit
different. Pink ones have a more tart or sour flavor, and red ones
tend to be sweeter. This whitish skin signals a pink grapefruit. Note
the weight, the size, and the smell, and always be on the lookout for
inner rot. If there are some dirty spots on the outside, just wash
them when you get home."</P><P>"I almost find this interesting," Naruto told her.</P><P>"Keep them up and out of the reach of bugs, and put them in a bag
to keep flies away," his mother continued. She bought three ripe,
pink ones and three ripe, red ones. "And always think about the
price. Grapefruit are grown in tropical areas like the shore of the
Wind Country. Since these come a ways, they will be a little pricier
than they would be if you bought them down at the shore. But…"
she started. "Almost never give in to the first price a merchant
gives you until you know about what is good. Each of the pink ones
was 1.45 Ryou. The reds were all 1.38 Ryou a piece. If the merchant
is within ten cents of these prices, they aren't scamming you. If
they're just a little bit above, reconsider where you are buying
from first; then ask for a slight decrease in price. On the other
hand, if they are ten cents or lower from the price, make sure to
sniff the fruit again for ripeness and quality. You might be getting
a good deal from a merchant worth his or her salt, but you also might
be getting bad products."</P><P>"How on Earth do you remember all of this?" Naruto asked in
disbelief. "I know how to buy a decent steak, but you just
explained the entire economic stance of one fruit. My head hurts."</P><P>"Experience is a good teacher," Kyuubi said quietly. "You can't
really haggle when it comes to buying clothing in the demon realm
though. Everything is hand made, and tailors hate hagglers."</P><P>"That reminds me," Kushina began, "you don't have any real
clothes left Naruto. Those are just illusions."</P><P>"Human clothes won't really suffice Kushina-San," Kyuubi
started. "Since he can change size, they would tear far too easily.
You can come with us to the demon realm sometime and help pick out
some stuff for your son though. All demons usually remain in this
form, but our clothes are made so that they sort of disappear when we
go into our full demon form. In other words, they're made to be
'demon-proof.'"</P><P>"Sounds interesting," the woman commented. They zipped around for
about an hour buying the stuff for hot sandwiches and a yummy fruit
salad. "See, we only spent twenty Ryou, and this is enough to feed
ten people including Gaara-Sama and his siblings. Save the eating out
for special occasions or set it for only once a week and you should
be able to come home with three-hundred Ryou without having to do
anymore Genin missions." Kushina carried three bags, Naruto had
another two, and Kyuubi carried their most expensive item, a large
desert fowl.</P><P>"The main things needed are clean hands, enough workspace, and the
right tools," the woman said. Kyuubi put down the four-winged
chicken-thing and washed his hands, and they went to work. Kushina
showed Naruto how to slice the grapefruit to get perfect triangular
pieces for the fruit salad, and in a matter of two minutes, the six
grapefruit were no more. "Good, now slice up the berries however
you want, but only chop the grapes in half. I gotta show Kyuubi here
how to pluck this mammoth, and then we'll cook it up. Remember to
thank Gaara-Sama for letting us use this kitchen by the way."</P><P>"Fifteen sandwiches…check, fruit salad…check, and ice
water…check," Kushina said as she went through her list. "Now
we just have to take these out to the oasis." Naruto and Kyuubi
were getting itchy from their heats, but the cooking had been fun.</P><P>"Oy, Sakura, Sasuke, guys, come and get it," Naruto yelled as
soon as he spotted his friends in the water. He had unzipped his
jacket, but he had a light t-shirt on underneath. Kyuubi quickly made
an umbrella and a picnic cloth big enough for all of them. "Gaara,
you and Temari and Kankuro can come too."</P><P>"Hey, this looks pretty good Naruto. Did you buy it?" Kiba asked
jokingly. Naruto twisted half his lip and rolled his eyes, but he
laughed. All of Naruto's friends seemed to be enjoying the water,
and they each had on swimsuits.</P><P>"Just sit down and eat dog-breath," Naruto replied. "This place
is really awesome. We ought to get a community pool back in Konoha."
Everyone agreed as they ate their sandwiches. Kushina had Naruto
slice the meat and tomatoes, but she had made the glaze. "The fruit
salad is nice and cold. Oh, we have ice water if anyone wants some."
Naruto prepared ten glasses, and eight were instantly taken.</P><P>"Not half bad dobe," Sasuke said as he took in a bit of
grapefruit. Everyone laughed as he puckered for the first time in
history from something sour. They sat and talked like the good
friends that they all were, but by the time they had all finished
their sandwiches, Naruto and Kyuubi were sweating and breathing
heavily.</P><P>"Naruto, are you guys alright?" Sakura asked. Everyone else
looked more closely and took on looks of concern. The girl put her
hand on Naruto's forehead, but she stayed away from his snowflake
mark. "You're hot, not burning, but you're at least at 101."</P><P>"Here comes the embarrassing part of the story," Naruto began as
he wiped his forehead on his sleeve. "Kyuubi's body and mine are
both in heat as you already know. Apart from the desire, the heat
causes us to 'heat up.' Basically, we just need to cool of in the
oasis. We're not sick or anything, but our bodies are starting to
feel really uncomfortable."</P><P>"You could have just said something and changed," Kiba started.
Sakura clocked him in the head again.</P><P>"Go into the changing rooms over there, and then go take a swim if
you need to," Gaara spoke as he pointed toward the stalls. Naruto
and Kyuubi were in, changed with towels, and out in a flash. "That
was fast," the redhead commented as Kyuubi laid down their towels
next to the umbrella and then ran out to catch up with Naruto.</P><P>"Talk about ritzy," Kankuro started. "Look at the designs on
these towels." Everyone was admittedly curious and examined them.</P><P>"Aw, how cute," Temari mused. "They're so into each other;
it's crazy. A fox and a wolf side by side…and the correct number
of tails on each too. Even though they're illusions, they're
really soft, and Kyuubi put effort into the design."</P><P>"Kyuubi's so nice to him. It's kinda strange to think about
it," Sakura said. "And Naruto isn't a train wreck over them
both being guys. He's grown up." While they were talking, they
watched as Kyuubi and Naruto splashed each other and wrestled in the
water.</P><P>"Whoa," Naruto half-yelled as Kyuubi pulled him under by his
legs. <I><B>Oh yeah,</B></I> he said through their marks. <I><B>Cool
off.</B></I> Kyuubi's eyes widened as ice formed around his whole
body. Naruto used his space-time manipulation to escape the fox's
grip, but he also brought Kyuubi above the surface.</P><P>"Now that's chilling," Kiba laughed. Kyuu broke out of the ice
easily, and he playfully shoved Naruto back in the water. "This
reminds me of the days back at the academy when we played like that."
The other three thought back on it, but then the memories of their
parents came to them as well. "His life really did suck," the
Inuzuka said more quietly. "He's reclaiming his lost childhood,
and it's kind of our parents' faults."</P><P>"There's no point in doting on the past," Kushina interjected.
"After all, that's what the villagers did for so long. They
couldn't see Naruto as himself; they only saw the evil Nine-Tailed
Fox that destroyed so many lives, and the worst part is that it
wasn't even Kyuubi's fault. I know it's pointless, but if
Minato were alive today, he'd be enraged at the villagers, and he'd
be like no other father before to Naruto."</P><P>"I'm glad Naruto-Kun found such a good friend," Gaara spoke. "I
hate to be the one to bring this up, but I don't think Naruto will
be able to stay in the Hidden Leaf Village at the rate things are
going. Those two are inseparable, and with so much bad blood against
him, it doesn't look promising." They all sighed and drank their
water.</P><P>"Remember how I said to go about depth training Naruto," Kyuubi
began. "Just go to the point it starts hurting and hover there for
as long as you can. Swim around on the same level until the pain
subsides, but the more important part is training your lungs to
handle the pressure and go without fresh oxygen for extended periods
of time."</P><P>Naruto swam down about fourteen feet before his ears started hurting,
and he stayed underwater for seven minutes before coming back up
quickly and getting fresh air.</P><P>"Don't exceed the speed at which air bubbles float to the
surface, or you could get a hydrogen bubble in your lung that will
explode at the sudden decompression," Kyuubi warned. "It would
knock you unconscious, and it could kill you if you drowned
elsewhere." Naruto did fell a bit lightheaded so he followed
Kyuubi's advice and did the exercise several more times before just
lazily back stroking. "That'll do for today."</P><P>"I'm in the mood to listen to some music," Naruto began before
making a platform of ice. As he started playing an energetic song,
people on the shore gathered to listen. They danced happily, and
Naruto's friends sat in amazement as they were reminded of his
talents. "I'll take one suggestion," Naruto yelled as he
finished. There were numerous yells, so he picked one that he could
identify from the others. "Bink's Saké it is." It was a
slightly complicated song, but Naruto managed. The lyrics sounded
from the shore, and Naruto played it through twice before receiving a
roaring applause from the onlookers. "Thanks everyone. I'll be
here for the next nineteen days," he called out. He was caught
completely off guard as an inexplicable pain shot through him, and
Kyuubi felt it from the shore. "What the…Hell?" he breathed as
he fainted. Everyone on the shore was stunned, and Naruto's friends
looked out in horror.</P><P>"Oh no," Kyuubi breathed. "Get everyone out of here. Naruto's
emotions just broke loose." That message brought terror to the
group, and they looked out as red light flowed beneath the surface of
the oasis. Kyuubi got up onto his legs and dashed out onto the water.
He looked out in sorrow as Naruto's unconscious body rose and
revealed blood-red eyes. Kyuubi was too far away to stop him.
Naruto's fingers hit the water, and the chords rang out. "Shit!"
the fox yelled.</P><P>"The Nocturne of Sorrows," Kushina said quietly. "Sakura get
the villagers away from here. Guys, I don't know how this one will
play out, but Sasuke and I are the only ones with speeds that can
match Naruto's taijutsu. If you see Naruto start fighting, run."
Tears came to her eyes, but it wasn't the song affecting her yet.</P><P>"Naruto, wake up," Kyuubi yelled as he neared the boy. Something
stopped him though, and that was the tears coming from Naruto's
eyes. This time was different; this time, he wouldn't go nuts.
"Kami, Naruto," he said more quietly. A tear fell from Naruto's
chin, and the oasis was frozen over instantly. "Diamond Dust,"
the redhead spoke as he understood the situation. Kyuubi calmly
walked over and sat next to Naruto as his own tears flowed. "Across
the dark and frozen lake, the winds of winter moan," he sang in a
completely different tone and rhythm. "The sad and lonely sound
they make… chills you to the bone."</P><P>"You are winter Naruto," the kitsune spoke quietly as he rubbed
the player's back. The song ended, and Naruto's eyes returned to
their blue color before the boy collapsed in Kyuubi's arms crying.
"Your days of sorrow have ended Naruto," he spoke softly. "Allow
spring to take hold; let me warm your icy heart." Kyuubi hugged
Naruto lovingly, and the boy's friends came running over the ice.</P><P>"Is he alright?" Gaara asked. Kushina felt deeply wounded by the
sight, but there was nothing she could do. Kyuubi put everything into
producing a calming scent as he hugged Naruto. Then something came to
him, and he stunned everyone by licking the mate's mark on Naruto
like he would lick a wound or clean himself. Naruto mewled a bit and
shivered, but then he fell limp in Kyuubi's hold.</P><P>"Now that's incredible," Kiba said quietly. Sakura didn't hit
him for once, and it was because he understood this. She decided that
it wasn't him thinking deviously or dirtily. Kiba was actually in
wonder.</P><P>Kyuubi hummed Kushina's lullaby, and Naruto's tears ceased as he
fell asleep. When he was finished, Kyuubi stood up and held Naruto
bridal style. "Let's get him back to our room," the fox said
quietly as he walked out onto the ice. What shocked him though was
that the ice fell away into water when he put his weight on it.
"Spring," was all he said. The group walked back to shore as the
ice melted away. They all ignored the stares of the villagers as they
gathered up their belongings and walked back toward the Kazekage
Mansion. "Naruto and I need to be alone," the redhead began.
"We'll see you guys later, but just let him rest for now."</P><P>Kyuubi set Naruto on the bed and closed the door. He laid down by his
sleeping and troubled mate and held him close, but the moment would
not last. Shukaku came up through the floor with a frantic look on
his face.</P><P>"I swear I'll kill you if this isn't important Shukaku-San,"
Kyuubi said darkly.</P><P>"Was that Naruto-Sama playing the Nocturne of Sorrows?" he asked
frightfully.</P><P>"Yes," the fox replied flatly. "Is that all?"</P><P>"I'm sorry that your mate is in pain," the tanuki said humbly.
Kyuubi was shocked, but he did not turn his attention away from
Naruto. "I had figured he was the one playing that, but I wanted to
be sure. How does Naruto-Sama even know it?"</P><P>"I believe his demonic instincts have somehow taught it to him, but
I cannot be sure," Kyuubi told him as he sat up.</P><P>"Kyuubi-San," he exclaimed. "You and Naruto already have two
reaffirmations? That's incredible." He paused before continuing.
"I…I need to apologize. I should have been happy for you two, not
jealous and angry. What I did is disgusting, but can you tell
Naruto-Sama that I am sorry when he awakens?"</P><P>"I'll do that, but he needs to rest," the redhead told him with
a smile. "His life was Hell compared to yours. He will lose control
of his emotions again probably, but I will protect him. You can hang
out with us tomorrow if you wish Shukaku-San." The silver-haired
youth was surprised by this, and he smiled as he disappeared in a
whirl of sand that fell through the floor. "I wonder what happened
to Naruto's icicles," the fox mused. "I would have expected a
puddle somewhere, but there isn't a trace." Kyuubi lay down next
to Naruto and hugged him closely, and eventually he fell asleep like
this.</P><P>"Kyuubi will probably scold me later, because he definitely knows
we're watching," Gaara said in his office. Everyone was attached
to his third eye and watched as Naruto and Kyuubi slept silently. "He
can be trusted with Naruto's care; rest assured."</P><P>"It really isn't just about sex is it?" Kiba more stated than
asked. "I never would have believed it had I not seen it. Hey, that
snowflake on Naruto's head is glowing," the boy noticed. All of
them turned their attention to it. Chakra flowed from the mark onto
Kyuubi's forehead as the fox unconsciously entered Naruto's mind.</P><P>"It's so dark," Kyuubi commented. "I only ever saw my cage
and what was directly outside it. There's water everywhere too
and…chains?" The fox used fire chakra and held a flame in his
hand. Truly everything was a set of corridors riddled with puddles
and chains hanging from the ceiling. "Naruto," Kyuubi called out
loudly. He received no response, but he felt an invisible force
pulling him down a particular hallway.</P><P>Kyuubi followed the seemingly endless trail of hallways that were
completely identical to each other until he came upon an open room.
"Oh Kami Naruto," the fox breathed as he looked everywhere.
Images of hating eyes hung everywhere along with every painful memory
the blond possessed. When Kyuubi looked up, he fell on his knees.
"No," he said as tears came to his eyes. Naruto was strapped to
the ceiling by chains, but he was surrounded by various almost
invisible spheres. They were protecting him from what truly shocked
Kyuubi. Blades stretched from a corner on every represented memory,
and they were all pushing into the spheres. One particularly painful
memory had broken through all but the last shield, and the last one
was cracked. Kyuubi followed the chain connected to the blade to the
memory, and nothing could hurt Kyuubi worse than what he saw.</P><P>"How could I do this to him?" Kyuubi asked himself sorrowfully.
It was the memory of Kyuubi from the first time Naruto had met him
when he was four years old. The scene played out in Kyuubi's mind
as he touched the memory.</P><P>"<I><B>Oh, you finally came to visit me…Naruto,"</B></I>
Kyuubi's dark and malevolent voice said tauntingly. This was his
former self. Kyuubi had blamed his miserable living on Naruto, and he
took it out on him too. Naruto's former self was in rags, and the
terrified look on his innocent face brought Kyuubi to tears. <I><B>"You
have heard this from the villagers. I am the Nine-Tailed Fox also
known as the Kyuubi."</B></I></P><P>"<B>Y-you,"</B> Naruto's former self said. <B>"You're…the
Kyuubi?"</B> Kyuubi only put on a chakra image for Naruto, so he
appeared to be even more threatening. The fox's former self smiled
and nodded. Naruto tried to get a closer look, but Kyuubi had scared
him on purpose for his own amusement by jokingly clawing out at the
boy. His enormous black claws slipped passed the bars, but they were
stopped, and Naruto fell backwards and covered his head in fear.</P><P>"<I><B>Aw,"</B></I> Kyuubi said evilly. <I><B>"Are you
frightened little orphan boy?"</B></I> Naruto looked up hesitantly,
but he didn't remove his arms from over his head. <I><B>"Unfortunately
for me, the Fourth Hokage sealed me in you. After that, your parents
ran away thinking it was over."</B></I></P><P>"<B>My…my parents?"</B> Naruto asked. <B>"Who are they?
Please tell me,"</B> the boy said frantically as he neared the bars
again. Kyuubi's claws shot through, and Naruto's former self
stopped dead.</P><P>"<I><B>It doesn't matter who your parents are brat,"</B></I>
the fox spoke evilly. Naruto became angry, but Kyuubi roared and
frightened every ounce of confidence out of him. <I><B>"You're
parents abandoned you because they think you're an uncontrollable
demon now. The entire village hates you."</B></I></P><P>"<B>No, don't say that,"</B> Naruto cried out as he teared up.
He was on his knees shaking. <B>"My parents love me; I know it."</B></P><P>"<I><B>Then why aren't they here?!"</B></I> the old Kyuubi
roared. <I><B>"They think you're a monster."</B></I></P><P>"<B>Stop it!"</B> Naruto yelled as tears poured from his young
eyes.</P><P>"<I><B>They think you'd kill them, that I would."</B></I></P><P>"<B>Shut up!"</B></P><P>"<I><B>You worthless insignificant bug," </B></I>Kyuubi roared.
<I><B>"Your parents hate you; get over it. They will never come
back for you. They've left to try and find someplace safe where you
can never hurt them. You are a curse to them. You are a curse to this
whole village. YOU ARE THE NINE-TAILED FOX!"</B></I></P><P>"<B>STOP IIIIIIT!"</B> Naruto screamed before he collapsed and
this nightmare faded. The last thing that Kyuubi could hear was his
former self laughing.</P><P>"Oh Kami," he said sorrowfully. "Why was I so cruel to him?"
Kyuubi was crying intensely. "I would happily die if it meant
destroying this memory. May the gods curse me forever. How can he
love me still while knowing this? Naruto, I am indebted to you. Even
if you cannot hear me, I pledge to always protect you and love you. I
do not deserve such mercy." Kyuubi looked up again and reminded
himself of just how close Naruto was to being consumed by this
memory. "I will not allow this to hurt you any longer my mate,"
the fox decided. He climbed the chain nimbly, and he quickly reached
the outermost protective shield.</P><P>Kyuubi tried pulling the chain out, but it didn't work. "Will it
cause you pain if I try to remove this pain Naruto?" he asked
toward the sleeping figure. The kitsune reached out, and the shield
allowed him free passage. Naruto's figure breathed deeply, and
Kyuubi stopped. He went on passed the second, third, and fourth, and
he took hold of the hilt on the dagger trying to penetrate Naruto's
final defense. "The Hells you have endured are not things you
should have to bear my mate," Kyuubi said before drawing the blade
out. The final shield instantly repaired itself, but this dagger had
a mind of its own, and it tried to fire back towards Naruto. Kyuubi
realized that there was no other way, and he plunged the memory deep
into his own stomach. Kyuubi lurched in pain and fell from the
ceiling as the chain snaked into him. "Aaargh," he seethed. The
portrait representing the memory folded up, and Kyuubi screamed as it
entered his stomach. "This pain," he said quietly.</P><P>Tears came to Kyuubi's real eyes, and everyone noticed in shock as
a larger chakra ball flew from Naruto into him through the
connection. Naruto's body smiled however, so the group was
confused. "Should we get them up?" Kushina asked.</P><P>"If Naruto shows any signs of weakening or being in pain, we will
end this, but we must be sure," Gaara stated.</P><P>"Nothing could ever be worse than this unless I lost you Naruto,"
Kyuubi spoke as he cried on the wet floor. The figure above him
smiled lightly, and Kyuubi watched as all of the blades were repelled
and sent back to their own memories. The chains surrounding Naruto
faded away, and he floated down lightly. Kyuubi caught him in his
arms, and a light shone behind Kyuubi. "My task is done Naruto,"
he spoke as he walked into the light. The chakra flowing between the
two stopped, and both men slowly woke up. "Na-Naruto?" Kyuubi
asked. Everyone in Gaara's office was relieved.</P><P>"Kyuu, is that you?" the blond asked as he turned. The fox
nodded. "What happened? I lost it again, didn't I?" he asked in
a resigned tone.</P><P>"Not this time," Kyuubi replied. The memory he had relieved
Naruto of was shoved into the back of his mind never to be seen
again. <I>I will destroy it at some point, but it was too dangerous
to do that inside Naruto,</I> he told himself. "You collapsed and
played that song again, but you vented your emotions instead of
keeping them bottled up. Naruto, you did very well." The blond let
a single tear escape him, and Kyuubi kissed it away.</P><P>"I love you Kyuubi," his wolf said quietly as he brought the fox
into a kiss. "Thank you for watching over me."</P><P>"I will protect you for as long as I live Naruto; I promise you,"
Kyuubi spoke before their marks glowed again. "Another so early?"
he asked. It wasn't a ring of symbols this time. Both demons
received a single picture. Naruto received a majestic bird. Kyuubi
received an eye with rays coming off of it. "Yours represents
freedom. I hope that being mates does allow you to live more freely
Naruto. I think it also represents your own beauty, but I can't be
sure. Mine is a symbol I have seen before on others. I will watch
over you for all of time Naruto, and I will let no harm come your
way."</P><P>Naruto buried his head in Kyuubi's neck and submissively nuzzled
him. "I can't think of a life without you Kyuubi," Naruto told
him. "Did anyone get hurt?"</P><P>"Not a single person was harmed Naruto," the redhead assured him.
"Your friends have been spying on us the whole time in fact."</P><P>"I knew it," Gaara said aloud.</P><P>"By the way," Kyuubi called. "If you want to catch tonight's
show, you need Naruto's permission." Gaara, Temari, and Kankuro
blushed, and the others smirked.</P><P>"Perverts," Kiba said deviously. Sakura hit him again. He had no
right to say the three were more perverted than he was.</P><P>"It's fine," Naruto said aloud. "If they aren't disgusted
by it, they can watch. Oh, and here's a shocker. You might want to
keep an eye on Sasuke and Kiba."</P><P>"YOU ASSHOLE!" both of them yelled. Sakura was going to have a
heart attack, and Hinata couldn't help but laugh. Kushina found
this whole deal to be awkward. Gaara and his siblings laughed their
heads off at the news. And Naruto and Kyuubi were having their own
laughing fit too.</P><P>"Oops, did I really let that slip?" Naruto asked jokingly to piss
off the two. "Well that gives you all two viewing options. Just
promise me you won't barge in here to break it up. That would be
embarrassing." Naruto couldn't hear them, so he eventually just
went back to looking at Kyuubi in wonder. "Something troubles you
Kyuubi," he began. "I smell worry."</P><P>"I somehow entered your mind as we both slept," the fox began.
"While I was there, I came upon your memories. The room was
indescribably horrible, but all you need to know is that I rescued
you from your own pain. I…sort of stole one particularly bad
memory, and I'm not going to keep it. You've grown beyond it, and
keeping it would serve no other purpose than causing you pain. At
some point I will destroy it."</P><P>"I smell that you are being truthful," his wolf replied. "I
will trust you, and thank you. No matter how dark it ever gets for
me…someone always pulls me out of it. I love you Kyuubi…my mate.
We should get dressed and join the others for dinner." The third
eye disappeared instantly after he said that. Naruto and Kyuubi made
clothes for each other this time. Naruto wore a semi-elegant
loose-fitting shirt that showed off his chest muscles. The main
fabric was light blue with an inch-wide red trim going down the
insides where buttons would be. The sleeves went out to Naruto's
wrists, but this wasn't a sweatshirt. He wore matching pants and
shoes too. "You can't resist looking at me can you?" Naruto
asked jokingly. "This is kinda like what Sasuke wears."</P><P>"I don't think yellow is my color," the fox replied. Naruto
laughed at the sight of him in a yellow jumpsuit before making Kyuubi
a legitimate effort. "This is fanciful." Kyuubi wore a robe that
played out a nighttime scene with an extremely detailed picture of
him and Naruto in human form and wearing ninja suits staring up into
the starry sky. "Hell, you don't need <I>my </I>help in making
designs. I love it." Naruto purred and nuzzled Kyuubi, and it sort
of made him feel embarrassed, but he went along with it. "It's
your instincts," the fox told him. "You're saying that you are
happy and thankful, and so do I." Kyuubi purred as well before
taking Naruto into a light kiss. "Now come on. It's time for
dinner."</P><P>"Whoa, nice threads," Kiba commented as Naruto and Kyuubi came
down the stairs. "Care to lend me some money?"</P><P>"They're illusions mutt," Naruto said jokingly. "Remember how
I changed into my birthday suit when we went to Akatsuki's
hideout?" Kiba grimaced. "Anyway, how are we gonna go about
dinner? I'm not particularly hungry." Everyone was shocked. "I
was like this last night. It's just that time of year." Naruto
winked once as a Sand Ninja walked passed.</P><P>"Well, I could eat a horse considering how your mom kinda drove us
here," Kiba spoke.</P><P>"How many times am I gonna have to run through this Kiba?!"
Sakura half-yelled as she thwacked him again. "You're not dying,
so just shut up about it. Yeesh."</P><P>"Eat what you want," Gaara stated. "I'm having a dinner in my
hall to welcome a representative from the Hidden Mist Village. You
guys really wanted to keep a low profile, so I chose not to formally
welcome you, but you are my guests."</P><P>"You really <I>are</I> different," Sasuke commented. "I almost
miss the psychotic Gaara."</P><P>"If you want to meet his alter ego, Shukaku is standing right over
there," Naruto pointed out. Everyone turned to see the
silver-haired demon standing alone sampling a cheese cube. "Hello
Shukaku-San," the boy said cheerfully.</P><P>"Ah, you're awake Naruto-Sama. I am sorry about what happened to
you earlier," the raccoon replied. "When I heard funeral music, I
could only guess a demon was playing it, but Kyuubi has little talent
for music."</P><P>"Hold the phone," Sasuke interrupted. "Naruto-<I>Sama?</I> I
realize he's the strongest Bijuu now, but he's still just
Naruto."</P><P>"He's also the second king of the entire demon realm," Kyuubi
said as he jumped in. "It's not likely that you will ever meet
the other one, but Naruto and he share the role of ruling over the
demons."</P><P>"And as such, proper respect is due," Shukaku ended.</P><P>"You're not acting crazy either," Sasuke groaned. "I guess
that's the end of my crazy opponents."</P><P>"Until we beat the Shadow Country," Naruto began, "I wouldn't
give up hope. I've met some bad ones already, and there is an
entire continent crawling with them. I think I'll just try some
green curry chicken and rice, and then I'll be done for the night."</P><P>Gaara went through the motions of welcoming the official, and
everyone just sat quietly. Kyuubi ate a few bites of shrimp, and
Naruto barely finished half of what was called a small portion. It
was strange to the blond that he didn't feel like eating much. They
sat and talked with Kushina and the others for another ten minutes
before Kyuubi gestured for them to go upstairs.</P><P>"There they go," Kiba whispered. "How long is Gaara gonna be
occupied?"</P><P>"You are such a pervert Kiba," Sakura said lowly.</P><P>"You're interested too Sakura," Sasuke spoke. "You can't
hide it. If you really don't want to watch, you don't have to. I
just hope they like to drag it out. Otherwise, they'll be done
before we even start watching." Kushina was stuck within her own
mind. Sex between guys was obvious in method, so the thought
frightened her. She needed to be sure that Naruto wasn't just in
pain. <I>I'll watch this one time, but never again,</I> she told
herself.</P><P>"We need to take a shower," Kyuubi told his mate as they entered
their room. He ran through his jutsu and locked the door. "Are you
really sure you want to allow them to watch us?"</P><P>"My mom needs to be sure, and no one else will worry if they see
that you don't hurt me," Naruto replied quietly and reassuringly.
"As long as they know that it is a two-way relationship, my friends
will leave us alone. Now come on foxy," he said in a new tone. "You
need a good scrubbing." Naruto didn't need to, but he playfully
pushed Kyuubi who was jokingly resisting into the bathroom. They
smiled as they turned on the warm water and dispelled their clothes.</P><P>"No one…male <I>or</I> female can compare with your beauty
Naruto," the fox told him genuinely. Kyuubi stole a lustful kiss
from Naruto, and he went all out with it, surprising the blond.</P><P>"Slow down," he laughed. "Geez, you're never that rough
during sex. Mating Season got your hormones?" Naruto teased.</P><P>"That and a cocky mate of mine," Kyuubi replied. They stepped
into the shower and felt a calmness rush over them as the warm waters
loosened their muscles. "Aah," the fox sighed. They went through
the usual motions of washing each other down, but Naruto teased
Kyuubi throughout the whole thing by licking Kyuubi's neck or
lightly chewing his ear. "You're anxious today," the fox
commented.</P><P>"So what?" Naruto asked as he turned of the water. He quickly
dried himself off and conjured his ninja suit.</P><P>"Weren't we gonna…" Kyuubi began.</P><P>"We'll do it properly one more time," Naruto replied. Kyuubi
hardened as he conjured his own ninja suit. He followed his blond
mate into their shared bedroom. Kyuubi looked up to the ceiling, but
the eye wasn't there. "Forget it," his mate told him. "They'll
catch what they catch. If they're late, so what?" Kyuubi turned
to see a chakra tail waving behind Naruto. Kyuubi pounced on him,
pushing Naruto onto the bed. He regained focus and softly kissed his
mate as he caressed the blond's cheek. Naruto was so open to him,
and this relationship of theirs wasn't very old, but Kyuubi knew he
couldn't just get away with ravaging his blond like an animal.</P><P>Like a perfectly submissive mate, Naruto bared his neck after they
broke from the kiss for oxygen. These kisses were always fiery, but
they were special to Naruto in that Kyuubi displayed his love and
restraint through them. Said fox was now licking up Naruto's neck
as he unzipped the blond's jacket. Naruto moaned from his tongue's
ministrations as he undid Kyuubi's jacket as well, leaving them
both with just the standard shinobi undershirt. The jackets
disappeared, and Kyuubi began pressing his hand over Naruto's abs,
feeling him up so to speak and building his already apparent arousal.
Naruto sat at four tails, and Kyuubi had two going as well.</P><P>"Now we're getting somewhere," Kyuubi commented as he left a
hickey on Naruto's collar bone. He was perfect at this; Kyuubi
never drew blood or caused pain, so Naruto was in heaven. Kyuubi
snaked his hands under Naruto's shirt and began lifting it over the
blond's head. When Naruto had his arms in the air and the shirt no
longer covering his head, Kyuubi kissed him lustfully. Naruto moaned
as Kyuubi fell on him and continued exploring Naruto's mouth with
his tongue. The fox finally discarded the shirt, and it disappeared
instantly. Naruto pulled up Kyuubi's shirt, and now both torsos
were exposed to the warm air.</P><P>"Come on Gaara," Sasuke called as they started climbing the
stairs.</P><P>"Yeah, they might be done already," Kiba spoke quietly as he was
next to the redhead.</P><P>"If they are going at the same pace as last night, you need not
worry," Gaara replied. They entered his office anxiously and shut
the door. "Now, I will warn you that this gets graphic. Naruto and
Kyuubi switch roles every night, so tonight Kyuubi is in control sort
of." Gaara covered his left eye, and everyone did the same. "Sand
Art: Third Eye." It took a while to hook this many people up, but
Gaara managed it. The good thing was that this technique didn't
require much chakra at all, so he could easily maintain it.</P><P>"Hoo boy," Kiba spoke in surprise at the scene he was witnessing.
He was quickly shushed by Sakura.</P><P>"Kyuubi," the blond giggled as the fox nibbled his now sensitive
ear. They were still half-dressed, so everyone wasn't immediately
grossed out. Kyuubi sat on the back of Naruto's legs and was
bending over the blond to reach his ear. "Come on; quit teasing. It
tickles." Naruto was giggling throughout this too, so Kyuubi
smiled.</P><P>"Oh, but Naru-Kun…your friends are watching," the fox demon
spoke. Everyone blushed. The part that threw them was that Naruto was
willing to do this when he <I>knew</I> his friends and his own mother
were watching. Naruto flipped Kyuubi off of him and waved up at the
eyeball suspended on the ceiling and smiled. "Well, that's one
way to acknowledge them," Kyuubi snorted. He pounced on Naruto
again, startling the onlookers. Kyuubi held Naruto's arms in the
air as he kissed him passionately. Naruto mewled just loudly enough
to be heard by his friends. Another feature to Gaara's third eye
was that it offered audio as well, so no detail went unknown.</P><P>"Kyuu aha," Naruto gasped as the kitsune lightly ground his hips
into his own. Kyuubi licked his neck and left a love mark on him as
he continued this agonizingly slow sensual torture. Naruto wanted
more, but he would wait. Naruto noticed that he was in range and
playfully bit down on Kyuubi's mate mark, making him shake with
pleasure.</P><P>"Hey, that's cheating," the fox teased as Naruto brought his
head back and smiled. Kyuubi kissed him again and let Naruto's arms
down as he felt over the wolf's abs again. Kiba, Sasuke, and
Kushina were practically taking notes in their heads. It wasn't
just lustful antics, and both of them were enjoying themselves, but
Naruto was ready to move on, and all five of them gasped as he slowly
took hold of Kyuubi's waistband. The blond pulled down his pants,
but Kyuubi had on plain red boxers too. Kyuubi understood and smelled
that Naruto's arousal was very strong now, and he felt the boy's
erection pushing against his pants. He relieved Naruto of the orange
bonds, leaving him with a pair of white and blue striped boxers.
Everyone in the group was surprised that both of their erections were
so large.</P><P>"See anything you like Kiba-Kun, Sasuke?" Naruto asked humorously
toward the floating eye.</P><P>"Do you want the first punch Sasuke?" Kiba asked angrily.</P><P>"Oh <I>do</I> go ahead and hit him when you get the chance," the
raven replied with a blush on his face.</P><P>Kyuubi moved his hands up more and massaged Naruto's chest with his
right arm as he opened the drawer to their nightstand. "Don't
tell me that's lubricant," Sasuke spoke with a wide eye.</P><P>"Are you ready my mate?" Kyuubi asked as he looked into Naruto's
eyes. He received a nod, and they started removing each other's
trousers to the dismay of Naruto's friends. When they were finally
removed, the boxers disappeared, leaving Naruto and Kyuubi fully
exposed. "Such beauty," the fox breathed. A fifth chakra tail
emerged from Naruto, and Kyuubi answered with two of his own. Kyuubi
practically laid down on Naruto as he stole a deep kiss from him.
When he rocked his hips, Naruto's body shook, and a moan could
easily be heard even through the kiss. "You're extra sensitive it
seems."</P><P>"You really know how to be a jerk," Naruto commented as he panted
and smiled. "But I can't stop loving you." Kyuubi undid the top
of the phial, and he slicked his three fingers well before lifting
Naruto's legs and kneeling to kiss his blond wolf. Just like the
other two times, Kyuubi knew how to be oh so gentle and get the job
done at the same time. He distracted Naruto's senses with the kiss,
and he barely tensed at all to the intrusion. The kitsune quickly
found Naruto's prostate, and the boy yipped when he thrusted
against it, making Kushina cringe. She had to keep watching, but she
really didn't want to anymore.</P><P>"Just another minute my beloved," the fox told him as Naruto
playfully licked his mark. After the promised sixty seconds of
three-finger scissoring, Kyuubi removed the digits, making Naruto
groan. His arousal was becoming overpowering, and it was beginning to
feel painful. Sucking him off wouldn't help at all. Kyuubi used a
generous amount of oil to coat his erection, and he picked Naruto up
completely and placed himself at the entrance. "Are you ready?"
Naruto kissed him passionately, and Kyuubi took that as his signal
and pushed passed the still slightly tight ring of muscle. This would
probably be Naruto's condition for the rest of their lives, and
Kyuubi loved it. Naruto moaned into his own kiss, and Kyuubi couldn't
help but open his eyes. Rubies met sapphires, and nothing was more
breathtaking.</P><P>"You can move," Naruto told him. Sasuke and Kiba were on the edge
of their seats, and Sakura and Hinata were not much better. Kushina
was about ready to run up to Naruto's room and stop this. Kyuubi
did as his mate suggested, and Naruto wrapped his legs around
Kyuubi's waist. Said fox began slowly thrusting into the blond as
he took his lubed hand and began stroking the wolf. Naruto hugged him
and rested his head next to Kyuubi's mate mark. He moaned every
time Kyuubi rubbed against that spot in him. He was sent shooting
into the skies every time. It was exhilarating. "Faster," he
asked. Kyuubi kissed him lovingly and changed his angle, making
Naruto shake with every thrust. "Kyuubi you're amazing," Naruto
declared as he threw his head back much like a slut would. This was a
moment when lust took over, and Kyuubi bit Naruto's neck lightly.
"Kyuubi!" Naruto moaned from the slight pain. Kyuubi lifted off
knowing that he had lost control slightly, but the good news was that
his fangs had been retracted. There were no puncture wounds. He could
feel the blond's blood rushing, and his own climax drew near.
Kyuubi flipped Naruto onto all fours and put one leg up so that his
aim was straight.</P><P>"I love you Naruto," Kyuubi told him again. He matched the rapid
rhythms of his thrusts and his pumping, and that combined with deeper
penetration left Naruto's mind reeling in bliss.</P><P>"Kyuubi my mate!" the boy moaned due to lack of oxygen. His seed
erupted forth onto his chest and the black sheets, and Kyuubi yelled
out Naruto's name as well as he shook from his orgasm taking over.</P><P>"Kami Naruto," Kyuubi breathed as he fell sideways and detached
from the blond. The boy fell limp into the bed, and Kyuubi scooted
next to him and turned the boy towards him. Naruto was barely
conscious, but he turned his head and smiled at his friends.</P><P>"Will that convince you?" he asked. Sand moved from the eye and
spelled out "yes" on the ceiling. The eye disappeared, and Kyuubi
began licking off his mate's seed. He stopped midway and allowed
Naruto to taste himself. "You taste better," Naruto half-laughed
before falling asleep. Kyuubi hugged him closely and drew the covers
over them.</P><P>Kiba and Sasuke were impressed by both males' stamina, but they
were more shocked by the nature of the session. They also admittedly
were erect, and they hid the evidence as best they could.
"Congratulations on getting laid Naruto," Kiba said jokingly.
Sakura grabbed him by his jacket and proceeded to beat the shit out
of him. Kushina sat back in shock. It didn't seem possible, but
Naruto both consented and enjoyed that experience. She could still
accept him, but the thoughts made her shiver. Sakura hit Kiba square
in the gut, and he coughed up blood. Sasuke stood up and finally
stopped the pink-haired girl.</P><P>"You've beat him enough Sakura," he said darkly. "But I do
agree with Sakura; your vulgarity needs some toning down." Kiba
nodded as he held an arm over his stomach. Sasuke proceeded to take a
room key and dragged Kiba by the collar. "Now I have to pay up on
my word too. You get to be Seme tonight." Kiba smiled
half-heartedly, and Sakura took on a devious grin.</P><P>"I bet he'll be lost on that one," she said. "Are you alright
Kushina-San?" she asked in concern. "I know this seems kind of
wrong and bad, but Naruto is okay. They switch roles too, so it isn't
like this is all he ever is."</P><P>"I think he's kind of manly being able to take it," Hinata
spoke up. Sakura blushed. That was one way of saying he enjoyed it.</P><P>"Yes, Naruto is strong, and he's in good hands," Naruto's
mother stated as she took on a small smile. "If he can actually
enjoy himself, who am I to stop him? Okay perverts, time for bed."
Kushina rushed them out of Gaara's office, but the redhead and
Temari chose to spy on Sasuke and Kiba.</P><P>"Aw, first timer," Temari commented. "Sasuke looks like he's
in pain."</P><P><B>Author Notes: I am so sorry that this took so long. I got some
great ideas for another contiguous fanfic, and I was stuck on how to
write that lemon. Thank you for reading. Review Please. I will try to
update sooner next time.</B></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><p><b>Author Notes: Welcome back one and all. </b></p><p><b>#######################$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%&&&&&&&&&&&</b></p><p><b>Suna, Day Twelve of Mating Season:</b> Kushina and the gang had already left for Konoha two days previous, leaving Naruto and Kyuubi to their days together. Naruto's heat had gotten worse, and he got several uncontrollable erections during the day when Kyuubi's scent got wafted into him too much. Playing for multiple hours in the oasis had become routine, and Naruto was only eight feet behind Kyuubi concerning how deep he could swim without feeling pain in his ears.</p><p>Naruto twitched in his sleep that morning, waking Kyuubi. The blond was whimpering slightly, but the fox didn't smell his arousal becoming painful at all. In fact, it wasn't really there. Something burdened his mate's mind, and Kyuubi tried to slip his way in, but Naruto's dream kept shaking Kyuubi loose until the blond muttered something.</p><p>"No, not our child," he spoke. Kyuubi was concerned. Naruto was having a nightmare about losing his offspring? The blond shot awake as he clawed at the air. Kyuubi smelled that he had released his poison too, but it didn't drip anywhere. He was panting, and Naruto's eyes were wide.</p><p>"Naruto," Kyuubi began. "Wash your hands out, and then please tell me what is troubling you." The wolf looked down to his claws and saw the shiny, light-red veil on the underside. He got up from the bed and walked naked into the bathroom and turned on the faucet with his other hand. When he returned, Naruto's eyes held a strong fear in them.</p><p>"Kyuu," he whispered as he sat down. "Please believe me," Naruto spoke. Kyuubi placed his neck over Naruto's left shoulder and nuzzled Naruto's face from behind. "We have to try and have a child…tonight Kyuu." The redhead was stunned as the information hit him like a ton of bricks.</p><p>"Naruto, you're not ready for something like that," Kyuubi told him. "Caring for a child is a huge undertaking, and you're too young."</p><p>"Kyuubi, there's this voice ringing in my head, and I can't stop it," Naruto told him as tears spilled down his face. "It keeps calling me daddy, and it keeps begging me not to abandon it. I don't know why, but I think it's our child. I can feel it like a little heartbeat. You have to believe me Kyuubi. It wants to be born, and I can't just <i>let</i> it die."</p><p>Kyuubi was at a loss and in shock. Naruto never lied, but this was unheard of in demon society. "Are you sure it isn't your nightmare?" he asked. Naruto nodded. "Let me into your mind," the redhead commanded. Naruto had done this twice before, so he knew the procedure. Kyuubi stood within the now dimly lit hallways of Naruto's mind. The torches were not hung on the walls before, and a lot of the water had dried up too.</p><p>"Daddy," a voice called through the darkness. Kyuubi did not know that voice, and it frightened him to no end. Naruto was telling the truth, but Kyuubi couldn't simply look for the source. Every inch of Naruto's mind echoed with the call. "Don't leave me daddy. I love you." Kyuubi flew back to his own mind in shock.</p><p>"Oh Kami above," Kyuubi whispered. "Naruto, this is unheard of. But can you really bear that responsibility? It's barely a one in a hundred shot of us even getting this to work, but if we had a child, would you be able to take the crying and the sleepless nights? It's a huge undertaking, and children are sacred to demonkind."</p><p>"Kyuubi, I only ever killed those I knew I had to kill," Naruto began. "If we don't try, I would never be able to live with the guilt, because it would mean I had abandoned our child and left it to die." Naruto was so pure when it came to things like this. He was stronger in morals than any other person Kyuubi had ever met, and Naruto had experience to back it up.</p><p>"We still have an hour before sunrise," Kyuubi began. "We ought to make this a two in a hundred instead of gambling on just one." Naruto smiled and kissed him back.</p><p>"Thank you so much Kyuubi," he said as tears of joy spilled from him.</p><p>"Now, this will be a one in a hundred for both of us, because we don't know if your part is a seed or an egg," Kyuubi stated. "It's your turn, so take me first. Make sure you determine in your mind that you want to sire a baby, because wavering will destroy the chance altogether and render your seed useless." Kyuubi kept telling himself he wanted to have a child with Naruto, and he remained fixated on the thought. Naruto put on a calmed face and shut his eyes and thought for a minute before pouncing on Kyuubi. Their clothes were gone from the previous night, so Naruto just went straight for Kyuubi's neck.</p><p>"Kami," Kyuubi breathed as Naruto ground their already hard cocks together. Naruto kissed him passionately and brought Kyuubi's tongue into a battle for dominance which he won anyway. He took a second to grab the half empty phial from the drawer and slicked up his three fingers. He wasted no time and simply put all three inside Kyuubi at once and smacked his prostate on the way in. "Jeez," Kyuubi whined and yelped. After a solid minute of scissoring, Naruto slicked up his ten and a half inch beast and slowly worked his way into his mate. Kyuubi gripped the sheets as Naruto kissed him lovingly. His focus was still on having a child, and Naruto wanted to make sure he finished while he still had his focus.</p><p>After thirty seconds of solid thrusting, Naruto picked Kyuubi up and turned him on his side. This method they had discovered allowed for the deepest penetration, and both males were in ecstasy. Naruto used his right hand still slicked with oil to jerk off his mate. Kyuubi's moans were intense, and they made Naruto harder as he pounded in faster. "NARUTO!" Kyuubi screamed as he came. His creamy white seed shot from his shaft like a firework and coated his face and the pillow his head was resting on in addition to his chest.</p><p>The walls of his insides slammed down on Naruto's rod in mid-stroke, and his climax came to him. "Kyuubi, oh Kami-Sama," he breathed as he kept thrusting in and out at inhuman speed. His seed shot into the deepest part of Kyuubi, and Naruto fell limp as the bliss rushed through him. He pulled his slick manhood out of Kyuubi, eliciting a moan from both of them. Naruto lustily licked away the fox's seed and kissed his lolling mate, allowing the delicious cum to mingle with their saliva.</p><p>"So," Kyuubi panted. "Is the voice gone?" Naruto listened carefully, but he still heard it in the confines of his mind. He shook his head. "Well, that means tonight I'll take you, but for now," Kyuubi said deviously as he pounced on Naruto. "I want to try something creative since we still have forty minutes. Since you just rammed the Hell out of me on short notice, I think I deserve some…enjoyment. This came to me in a dream, but it will work. It's an elaboration of that technique for licking off dried seed." Kyuubi kissed Naruto lustily, and both males swallowed part of his fluids. He then rose and turned around while still supporting himself on his feet and hands. Naruto noticed what hung in the air above him.</p><p>"A double sucking?" he asked a bit surprised. "That's genius. I knew today would be fun."</p><p>"Hnnn, but of course Naru-Kun," his mate spoke lustily before adjusting his knees. The blond wolf quickly took the head into his mouth, and Kyuubi shivered. "Ooooo yeah." He couldn't leave his wolf hanging, or in this case, stuck up without relief; the redhead began softly licking at the stark organ. Kyuubi also knew other ways of pleasuring his partner. He encased Naruto's sac in one hand, filling the blond with warmth. When Naruto's ministrations slowed, Kyuubi knew he had done it right. He massaged the sensitive thing, and his mate moaned against his shaft. "See my little wolf? I find it much more enjoyable when we are helping each other." He received affirmative humming, and the redhead shook from that too before engulfing the blond's manhood in its entirety.</p><p>"AH! Kyuubi damn you," Naruto breathed in ecstasy. He went back to working on the fox, and the redhead began lightly thrusting into his delicious warmth. The blond had easily learned how to not gag, and it paid off in spades. Kyuubi moaned against his shaft, and Naruto tasted the salty nectar as it came spilling forth, his mate moaning and lightly pushing his hips into the blond's throat. Naruto simply loved Kyuubi's taste, and he knew the redhead loved <i>his</i> just as much. He panted a bit and savored in the warmth of his fox's mouth. "Come on Kyuubi," he encouraged huskily. "Make me shiver and cum for you. Make me feel alive you kinky son of a bitch." His mate loved those dirty words, and Kyuubi gave Naruto what he wanted. He reached back and dug his claws into Naruto's mating mark. The boy's body locked up, and the sharp intake of breath was the only warning the fox got before semen exploded into his mouth. "Aaaaahnnnng, fuck I love you Kyuubi!" the blond cried out. His mate swallowed every drop before crawling back to lie with his panting and lolling mate.</p><p>"Fun right?" the redhead asked. Naruto just smiled as he panted, and Kyuubi lightly kissed him and gave him some energy. He received an intimate hug from the blond, and he was lightly smiling, signaling his relief. "You are beautiful Naruto."</p><p>"I…can say the same…for my kitsune," Naruto replied between deep breaths.</p><p>"Hm, your kitsune is very happy for that," his mate replied as he held Naruto's face and rubbed over his whisker marks. "You intoxicate me Naru-Kun; I wish to just remain here and drink in the sight of you. Nothing else is as fulfilling." The blond smiled before taking the back of Kyuubi's head and kissing him deeply. His fox held his back gently and yet intensely as they showed their love to each other.</p><p>When Naruto separated, his look had softened, darkened even. "What's wrong?" his mate asked slightly in worry. Naruto's eyes were much duller than usual.</p><p>"It's nothing to worry over my mate," the blond replied with a small smile.</p><p>"You are a terrible liar," Kyuubi commented. "Your body whines out for comfort. What troubles you my wolf?" The redhead snaked his way behind Naruto and held the blond to his chest as they lay back in the bed. He massaged his mate's scalp, knowing intimate touches brought much relief to the young Bijuu lord. Kyuubi placed his cheek against the side of the blond's head, his nose just above Naruto's ear. "You will tell me," the fox spoke softly.</p><p>"Our child is crying; it is afraid," Naruto spoke. Kyuubi understood. It would be even more like this when and if the wolf-boy became pregnant. He held the blond closer to him and leaned down to reassuringly lick the red symbol upon Naruto's shoulder-neck junction. "I would be scared too, if <i>my</i> life were that fragile. Kyuu?" he asked. The redhead brought the blond lower so that their eyes met. "Will you promise me that you will try your absolute hardest to save our child?"</p><p>"If it shall please my mate, then I will act," the fox spoke before kissing his blond again. There were knocks at the door. "Just a sec," he called before summoning up clothes for both himself and Naruto. "Alright, we're decent." The door opened and revealed Temari.</p><p>"I'm just here to invite you down to breakfast in the hall," she spoke. The sight of Naruto nestled on Kyuubi so was very cute in her opinion. "If you two were having a moment, breakfast can wait." Naruto was up and going out of the room.</p><p>"I never wait for food," he declared. Kyuubi snuffed and smiled before getting up and following after, much more slowly though. The fox decided to converse with Temari as they descended the stairwell.</p><p>"Shukaku's been really well behaved since you brought him here," the blond girl told Kyuubi. "What did you do to him?" Kyuubi didn't mean to, but he came up with a pretty deep answer.</p><p>"We did the same thing that Naruto did to Gaara; we gave him a friend," he replied. Temari was silenced by this answer.</p><p>"Kyuubi, I'm almost afraid to ask, but why do humans hate demons?" she asked. "I've only ever known you, and I guess Shukaku, but what about the others?" The fox closed his eyes as he kept going down the stairs slowly.</p><p>"People have come to fear our power because other humans abuse it," he responded. "In turn, we became ostracized, and demons fled into a dimension which at one point we shared equally with humans. This world and ours were linked perfectly, a literal window always being open in many different places. After people began hating us, going on demon hunts, and killing my kind, our ancestors used their power to close off the windows, and our kinds separated. The truth is, the only original distinction between demons and humans was that we had tails. It was common for demons and humans to be close friends, and there were marriages and matings between our kinds too. The original views of sexuality were the same to both of our kinds too; no one wore clothing except during the harsh season of winter. Bodies were not as forbidden then. After the split, even we began completely covering our 'shame.' And only after we had become feared and hated had so many things changed for humankind. Same-sex couples became illegitimate, pregnancies could no longer be controlled, and the concept of mating was lost. The other side-effect was that humans lost their long lifespan." Temari was surprised by this comment. "It was originally common for humans to live to be six or seven-hundred years old."</p><p>"All of that changed just because people wanted power?" the girl asked.</p><p>"Some deep evil exists now, and it is omnipresent in all of us," Kyuubi replied. "We have to better ourselves, protect what is ours, let no harm come to our beliefs, our people, our friends. War erupted from greed, greed came from awe in strength, and strength came from the will to protect. Protection only became needed when conflict arose between humans lusting for the power in demons. The art of sealing was created along with many abominations that ruin nature. Nowadays, lust has become corrupt, a drive originally beautiful and meaningful. Lust today brings rape, fear, and sadness. Originally, lust was accepted as one's awe in the form of another. It was attraction in all things. Wishing to lie with another was not negatively viewed upon. Relationships certainly meant what they do today, but if you were sought after, it meant someone was attracted to you. If someone was attracted to you, both you and this person could explore each other's minds, lives, hearts…<b>.</b> The attraction would be the beginning, and then you could make your choice as to whether or not you took your admirer as a mate."</p><p>"That's so hard to believe," Temari told him.</p><p>"Do not feel guilty," the demon fox told her. "I can barely picture it either. Paradise can only be understood by those who experience it. It was a world without conflict. There would be sadness, sickness, and death, but fighting had no place in ancient times. Nature guided all things. I do not know how different things would be if Naruto and I had met in those times."</p><p>"Well, what matters is that you guys are together," the girl stated. They finally came to the bottom of the stairs. Naruto waved at them from the table as he sat next to Gaara, two other plates in place. "Aw, thanks Naruto."</p><p>"You're welcome," the blond stated with a smile. He swallowed a bite of fish before Kyuubi sat next to him. They ate and chatted for a while, and the signs of the blond's AND Kyuubi's heats came forward. "I want to just crawl into a cold, wet cave. At least I wouldn't be feeling so hot."</p><p>"We will be going out to the oasis later Naruto," Kyuubi spoke before chewing on some hash browns. "Just be glad you're not alone like Shukaku is. Every year after this will be more manageable. Just be patient." He spoke more quietly "I wouldn't leave my mate to suffer alone." The blond smiled lightly, and he partially froze his glass of water before taking a swig. Itchiness began setting in. Today would be especially bad. He could tell that much.</p><p>"It's quieting a bit," the wolf whispered. "I've been talking to it Kyuubi. As long as I'm comforting, it is happy." Kyuubi lightly smiled in acknowledgement. "Care for a swim?" His fox merely smiled in reply before rising to leave, and Naruto followed behind.</p><p><b>Konoha:</b> "Uuuugh, it's boring without that dobe around," Sasuke groaned. He hated to admit it, but without Naruto, the Village Hidden in the Leaves was one boring place. "Kakashi, please tell me we're doing something relatively interesting."</p><p>"Well, our mission today involves capturing two escapees, Raijin and Fujin," the white-haired man replied. "They're both very powerful taijutsu artists, known to be easily enraged, and according to Tsunade, they're terribly stupid. In other words, an easy way to let out some anger or to get over boredom."</p><p>"Fine by me," the Uchiha stated. They set out into the northern woods, and it didn't take long for the sounds of breaking trees to be heard. "I'm guessing that's our cue?" Kakashi nodded. The Jounin decided to watch his students unless things got dangerous.</p><p>"Hey, Fujin, isn't that girl pretty?" Raijin asked.</p><p>"Yes brother, I think we should go play with her," the sibling replied a bit dumbly. "Come here Pinky," Fujin spoke like he was trying to lure a cat. Sakura of course leapt at Fujin with guns blazing. Sasuke burnt Raijin's ass with a Dragon Flame Jutsu, and the battle progressed in Team Seven's favor rather quickly. Sasuke only took one hit the whole battle, but now his stomach was sore.</p><p>"Well done you two," Kakashi spoke as he jumped down. All four of the combatants were exhausted. An extraction team of ANBU appeared, and they dragged the two mini titans away. "The rest of the day is yours."</p><p>"Great, now I'm bored <i>and </i>sore," Sasuke complained. A thought occurred to him though. <i>Kiba should be available though.</i> The Uchiha darted back to the village, and he found his boyfriend lazing about his house. "What are you doing in my house?" he asked calmly, a bit in surprise.</p><p>"I was bored," Kiba replied flatly. He was flicking through Sasuke's porn collection, all of it being gay of course. The Uchiha came up behind him and seductively wrapped his arms around the brunette's stomach.</p><p>"So was I," the raven spoke quietly. "Shall we alleviate our boredom?" Kiba turned and kissed him lustily before Sasuke carried him to his room. The bed was covered in fine black silk sheets, and you could fit eight people on it if you tried. Sasuke kicked off his sandals, and Kiba was already barefoot. He then began kissing his brunette into the bed, rough, desperate, and then calming a bit. His mutt wriggled out of his grip before crawling to the center of the mattress fit for a prince. "You look sexy today," the Uchiha spoke at attempted dirty talk.</p><p>"Just leave that to me Sasuke," Kiba spoke humorously. "You can't be perfect at everything."</p><p>"True, but I'm perfect at fucking you." The brunette got zero warning before his boyfriend was on top of him, kissing passionately, and grinding their clothed lengths together.</p><p>"Aaah! Yes Sasuke," Kiba whispered. The raven licked the shell of his ear, tearing a loud moan from Kiba as his dexterous fingers lifted the Inuzuka's shirt. His brunette mewled beneath his touches, Sasuke's pale fingers tracing over smooth and tight tan skin. He found a hardening nipple and gave it a light twist, receiving an arching from his lover.</p><p>"Do you want more?" the Uchiha heir asked.</p><p>"Yes, please Sasuke," Kiba wheezed. He received rougher nipple twisting, but it was a slight burning which was oh so enjoyable. After about a solid minute of torture and no progress, Kiba began getting annoyed. "Come on Sasuke," he whined.</p><p>"I can't help you if I don't know what you want," the raven commented like the jackass he was.</p><p>"You know exactly what I want damn you," Kiba replied.</p><p>"Do you want me <i>inside</i> you?" Sasuke asked as he breathed searing heat onto his boyfriend's ear, and he punctuated "inside" by grinding their completely stiff members together harshly. Needless to say, the brunette could barely speak.</p><p>"Fuck me before I get Shino to do it," he growled angrily. Sasuke frowned; Kiba had originally been Shino's alpha. He stripped them both down without regard for warning or space. "Thank you." SMACK! "OUCH! Son of a BITCH!"</p><p>"You know how I feel about that bug freak," Sasuke stated. "An alpha only punishes when he feels his beta needs it. A spanking is hardly punishment." As he said all this, the raven had begun slicking his fingers with the lube he kept on his nightstand. The blue jelly felt cold, but as it warmed, it became like quicksilver. Two digits shot into Kiba, expertly hitting that sweet bundle of nerves inside. The canine boy at first tensed and yelled loudly in pleasure, but now he settled as his boyfriend kissed and worked on him. A final finger soon joined the party, but the brunette's body was very used to it. Since it was so early in the day, Sasuke would probably be taking his ass again later that night.</p><p>"Nnnnn," Kiba moaned lowly as his boyfriend licked up his neck and nipped once in a while. Even though Sasuke was an ass, he made a great lover. He tensed when the three fingers left him, but Sasuke kissed him as a distraction while he lubed up his shaft. Kiba could feel the tip waiting patiently at his entrance, and Sasuke's tongue softly played with his own. In an instant, the brunette was thrust into, making him scream in pleasure as his prostate was abused. Kiba saw stars, and he panted and lolled for Sasuke.</p><p>"I told you I'd alleviate our boredom," the raven spoke as he gave his partner a well-deserved minute to cool off. Kiba was practically addicted to this, Sasuke's rough and hands-on approach. It had left him hurting the first four or five times, but the raven could make him cum like he never did with Shino. And the few times where he had let Shino top, Kiba had realized the bug-user didn't have much talent or confidence in himself. To top it off, Shino was only six inches long, and he wasn't very wide either. Sasuke had eight solid inches of stark, swollen man meat. When <i>he</i> penetrated, Sasuke gave his boyfriend the thrill of a lifetime, being so full without being torn open. It was unbelievably pleasurable.</p><p>"Mind moving?" the brunette finally asked as he wrapped his legs around the raven's waist, wrapped his arms around his neck, and brought their lips together. This was where Sasuke was a bit weak. When his lover asked so kindly and worked so hard, he couldn't deny him anything. It wasn't really weakness; no, it was more like Sasuke could actually love if you dug deep enough, and that was very deep down.</p><p>"Anything for you Kiba," the raven spoke softly before taking his lips softly. Now the brunette was surprised. A, Sasuke was being sweet <i>during</i> sex. And B: he didn't refer to Kiba as "mutt" during their activities. He began lightly pushing into Kiba, a sweet and sensual, rhythmic dance. The brunette softly broke off and smiled lightly as he stared into his lover's eyes. "Something wrong?" his boyfriend asked, still caring.</p><p>"No, I just don't see you like this too often," the brunette commented sweetly. Sasuke considered roughly thrusting in, but he found that his lover wasn't being sarcastic. He sped up only a little before taking the boy's lips in his own. Kiba moaned into the kiss, each connection bouncing against his inner pleasure center. He mewled especially loud when slightly cold fingers wrapped around his manhood, which was only a third of an inch shorter than Sasuke's. It was just as thick though, and hard as a rock. "Mmm, Sasuke," he sighed.</p><p>"It's not too often that we make love," the raven commented, the same, slow rhythms of pumping and thrusting matching. It was true, most times they just rutted until climax, and then they went about their business. Those sessions were relatively quick and rough. This one was slow, loving, and pleasurable in a way besides just the sexual intercourse.</p><p>"Ya. Hey, Sasuke?" he began. His boyfriend stopped to listen. "I love you." Kiba took his lips again, and Sasuke began his ministrations again, the brunette shivering under his skilled touch. The one girl Sasuke had been with when he was under Orochimaru's instruction was a bitch, a terrible ninja, and she was so unresponsive in bed. He liked that he could get so much out of his partner now. Sasuke could feel his stomach getting hotter, tighter. He sent chakra through his hand, causing warmth and a special frequency of vibration which Kiba could never get enough of. "Aaah, please Sasuke, more." The raven had no intention of giving into lustful desires right now, but he wasn't teasing either. This slow climb to the top meant that Kiba sat on the edge for a long time. A thumb softly flicked over the tip of his manhood, and the bliss came. "Ooooo Sasukeeeeeee," Kiba sighed/moaned. He leaned back, dazed by the euphoria as his seed spilled forth, covering his chest and Sasuke's hand. The raven felt the familiar tightness take his cock, and his tension released as orgasm came to him. His load softly filled his lover's insides, and both boys felt like some giant weight had been removed as they relished in the aftershocks, like after a month of super stress and then going to a worry-free day at the spa. Sasuke fell forward, but he caught himself on his arms and laid on his side.</p><p>"Wanna just stay here for a while?" Sasuke asked Kiba as he stroked a red tattoo.</p><p>"Sure," the brunette answered before kissing his boyfriend.</p><p><b>Naruto and Kyuubi:</b> They had eaten lunch and jumped back in the oasis, Naruto experiencing worse and worse heat. He was sweating and flushed <i>in</i> the water. He had frozen a small dome and linked it into the sand, creating a cold tub in which he could relax. Kyuubi though, shivered.</p><p>"C-C-C-C-C-Curs-s-s-se th-th-that heat res-s-sistant, s-s-skin," the fox spoke. Naruto felt bad that his mate was forced to sit through this.</p><p>"I'm really sorry Kyuubi-San," he spoke. His fox just smiled. "You'll get sick if you stay, and I need your…seed later," Naruto whispered after looking around to make sure no one heard. The fox jumped out onto the warm sand.</p><p>"Much better," he spoke. Kyuubi sat down and watched his mate sit, swim, dive, and relax. "Naruto, quit worrying about me." The blond couldn't help it.</p><p>"I should be spending my time with you though," the blond spoke softly. Kyuubi had patiently waited for a couple of hours, and the blond couldn't help but feel guilty. His mate could sense it through their mark.</p><p>"Well, maybe we should just go back to our room," the redhead suggested. Naruto lightly smiled, a bit in relief and a bit in thanks. After climbing from the water, the ice chunks cracked apart. The two picked up their towels, dried off, and began heading back, Naruto getting worse and worse along the way. "I have a theory," Kyuubi spoke softly. Naruto grunted in reply. "Our kid might be making you feel worse because it doesn't feel safe." The blond looked down at where his seal used to be, vainly trying to see his worrying child.</p><p>"I still feel it," the blond spoke as they made it to their door. Kyuubi and he stepped in, and the door was locked shut. The fox wrapped his arms around the blond's chest and nuzzled him in comfort. His jutsu would now run around the clock until they left the Sand Village, so no time was wasted.</p><p>"I will couple with you for as long as my energy holds," the man promised. "I know I don't really need to tell you this, but keep your mind on the kid." Naruto nodded as he dispelled his clothing. Kyuubi carried the miserable boy to the bed, his sweating bad, his breathing quick, his heart racing. He kissed the blond, and his muscles all relaxed a bit. The fox knew however, that relief would only arrive when they finished. "Simply hold onto me Naruto," he spoke. Kyuubi had slicked his fingers with the herbal oil, and he softly pressed all three in, earning a cringe and a whimper of pain from his mate. "The sooner you climax, the faster the pain will leave Naruto. I won't be rough, not yet." He kissed his mate reassuringly as Naruto clung to him with his arms and legs. Kyuubi found the blond's prostate first without causing much physical pain. If he could keep his mate in a state of at least equal pleasure, Kyuubi would feel much better, his mark and instincts currently making him feel guilty. Naruto moaned lightly, and his mate claimed his lips before lightly massaging the spot. He began feeling the familiar stinging pull on his inner flesh, but it wasn't painful. In fact, after about two minutes, the blond began thrusting against the fingers.</p><p>"You are ready?" Kyuubi asked, receiving a soft smile and nod in return. He removed his fingers, making his mate whimper slightly at the loss of his sensual pleasure. The redhead used what remained on his fingers to slick up the head of his shaft, figuring what had already been done would make his blond soft enough. Naruto nodded as he felt the tip lightly gracing his entrance. "This first time, I will be gentle. I promise you my okami." (For those who forget, Okami means wolf) Kyuubi kissed him lovingly as he lightly pressed in, his mind dead-set on getting the child his mate carried half of. Naruto scrunched his hands in the fine and yet wiry hair of his fox. The red-orange had a wonderful gleam in the sunlight, and it was much prettier on a human head than in Kyuubi's fox form. Not to say that the blond wolf had no feelings for Kyuubi when he looked that way. Both forms were handsome, ethereal, and beautiful in their own ways. Naruto moaned when his mate brushed his prostate.</p><p>"I love you Kyuubi," he spoke. The kitsune nuzzled him, licked reassuringly, and kissed the boy until he was completely inside. Being the amazing mate he was, Kyuubi gathered the pillows and sheets and made a comfortable place to lay his partner on. It provided soft support, so the two could keep their angle, but Kyuubi wouldn't have to worry about roughly pounding Naruto into springs or collapsing on him when he ran out of steam.</p><p>"As I love you my mate," the fox spoke before softly bringing his hands to the wolf's smooth and well-toned backside. He lightly massaged Naruto, and the blond relaxed entirely and smiled lightly. His eyes were nearly shut, not from being tired, but because he was so relaxed. Kyuubi rarely saw him like this, being treated like the god he saw the wolf to be. The redhead began lightly moving into his mate, and Naruto mewled the second it began, eyes fully shutting as his body and mind told him to relinquish everything. His mind remained focused on the child, but the unborn thing was silent, knowing that its life was valued. The blond could swear he felt a hug that didn't belong to Kyuubi. <i>I am here,</i> Naruto spoke into his mind. <i>We love you.</i> A warm feeling unlike anything he had ever felt flooded his being, and Kyuubi felt the spark of life.</p><p>"Our child says he loves you," Naruto spoke, just above a whisper.</p><p>"We don't know if it is a boy or girl yet my mate," Kyuubi told him, even though he was internally elated to hear such news.</p><p>"I can't call something I love an 'it,' but I know Kyuu. I know." The fox kissed him lovingly, rubbing over the whisker marks he had had from birth, even from before Kyuubi was sealed into his body. Naruto's tongue decided to dance too, slowly. Everything was currently slow and loving, and that was how both males wished it to be. The fox remained stroking the marks caringly and kissing his mate as he lowered his left hand. Naruto wasn't even erect. This surprised them both, but Kyuubi knew he was gleaning a pleasure beyond the physical spectrum. "Kyuubi" Naruto moaned/whispered. The warm hand of his lover made him feel so safe, so loved. He would give anything to remain like this for all time.</p><p>"I love you Naruto, my okami, my mate," the fox whispered, still rocking, still pumping, still making love to the one he treasured above all else. He began licking at the mate's mark, bringing the necessary lust forward. It was true, in order to orgasm, you needed to be pleasured, and in the case of males, you needed to be hard. Kyuubi got the rise from his mate that was required, and he began jerking and thrusting a bit more quickly, still slower than most could be patient with. Both of them climbed so high, relishing in each other, feeling everything of each other through their mating bond. Kyuubi kissed his love passionately, and he continued his tireless pattern without fail.</p><p>"Kyuu, I'm," Naruto whispered, his breathing a bit faster than normal, a light panting which showed how he neared release. The fox could feel the tension on the inside of the blond's body, his walls waiting to lock down upon command of their master. Thirty more seconds of lovemaking brought the blond over the edge more softly than he had ever been taken before. He mewled, and Kyuubi moaned as the internal walls locked down. Naruto came, just barely dribbling his seed into his mate's hand and down his shaft. "Kyuubi," he breathed. His mate finally fell too, and a delicious warmth encased his body.</p><p>"You are beautiful my okami," Kyuubi spoke as his seed softly coated the blond's insides. Naruto's grip did not slacken; he held to his mate, and he kissed Kyuubi after opening his eyes. "I wish to know…the second you sense life growing," the fox spoke. Naruto lightly smiled and nodded. They still had not disconnected, but the fox decided to cuddle with his mate for a while. The energy demons possessed was meant for a night like this; it was barely three o' clock. Kyuubi began playing with Naruto's chest, his nipples.</p><p>"Aagh, nnnn," Naruto mewled. "Kyuu-San." The fox especially loved his pet name, common among both humans and demons. He lightly pinched one nipple, but he encased the other in delicious heat. Naruto loved what that mouth could do. Kyuubi used his hands to massage his mate's abdomen, the wonderful bumps each so sensitive to pinpoint touches. When his mate was finally hard, Kyuubi kissed him, licking for the entrance he so wished for. Naruto of course gave it to him willingly. His fox loved the taste of his lover's mouth. He knew what to do to get his mate to moan too. Certain little spots had that effect when massaged with his appendage. Naruto felt Kyuubi hardening within him again, and he growled as a signal to his canine mate.</p><p>"Your instincts are wonderful…Naru-Chan," the fox spoke before roughly thrusting inward, his desire for rutting having come up in spades. Naruto literally howled his satisfaction. The chakra tails began coming out, and the room smelled of arousal. While everything was extremely inviting, Kyuubi's mating mark warned him not to break his mate. "Are you ready?" he asked, voice slightly influenced like when Naruto used to use too much of the fox's chakra. It was more seductive sounding, and the blond bared his neck. "I will love you, mate." He leaned close, bringing their bodies into fuller contact before rolling his hips in a steady pattern.</p><p>"Kyuubi," Naruto whined as he smiled. The fox pinned his arms and began licking the Bijuu lord in many different sensitive areas. It was still worshipping, but Naruto couldn't relax. His mate craved him, and he craved the fox demon right back. The blond used his tails to trace over his mate's body, and the chakra was solid, flexible enough for such an erotic task. "Harder mate," he spoke out, quickly receiving what he desired. One would have seen this and cringed at expecting it to hurt. Even amongst this though, both males still kept the desire for children in their minds.</p><p>"Naru-Chan," the horny demon whispered as he traced the blond's inner thighs. His mate tensed, and it gave the fox a wonderful feeling. Kyuubi grasped his mate firmly and began pumping in time. "Now finish," he spoke huskily before biting down on the mating mark, drawing some blood where his top canines punctured the skin.</p><p>"MAAAAAAATE!" the wolf demon screamed out, insides locking down, legs hammering the fox into him, pleasure flooding his entire being. Semen shot into the air as his mate thrusted against him. Naruto was coated in streaks of white. Kyuubi howled as his cock was captured. His seed flooded his mate's insides, and both males fell quiet, their animalistic desires quenched. The tiny wound on Naruto's shoulder-neck junction radiated in the warmth his mate gave him, even as it closed over.</p><p>"Feeling…better?" Kyuubi asked between pants. Naruto nodded.</p><p>"Hold me, mate," he spoke as he wrapped his arms around Kyuubi's back. The fox understood, and he covered his mate's body with his own, a promise of protection. They kissed lovingly, and their marks radiated with each others feelings. "Kyuubi, I love you so much. Don't ever leave me." the fox was confused by this. Didn't Naruto understand what their marks meant? Then again, it was Naruto, a lonely and easily frightened creature…a beautiful one too.</p><p>"I will never leave my mate," the fox whispered. That night, Gaara had found that the two wished to be alone, and he left them to their mating. The pair coupled numerous times, both bodies' energy spent as they came off the crest of another orgasm, both once again releasing their seed. "Naruto, I love…" Kyuubi began before he collapsed on his side, bringing Naruto to sleep with him, his arms wrapped around the blond's stomach, holding his mate close. "I love you," he whispered in his sleep.</p><p>Their attempts had not gone unanswered. In his dreams that night, Naruto began feeling a second presence. His child wasn't crying out for him; it was silently growing inside him. In his sleep, the blond grasped his mate's hand. They had done it, against all odds; the two had begun siring a pup.</p><p>The next morning, Naruto awoke crying tears of joy. "Kyuubi, wake up, please wake up," he asked in happy desperation as he shook the fox. His mate was spent, but his eyes cracked open.</p><p>"Naruto, what is" he began before getting cut off.</p><p>"We did it. I feel our child," the blond declared. Kyuubi's brain couldn't process at full speed. The message played out. "III feeeel ooour chhhhiiild." The redhead awoke completely. "Kyuubi, thank you so much." Naruto hugged his mate, and the fox hugged back, rubbing over his mate's back. "I feel it."</p><p>"Naruto, congratulations," Kyuubi spoke as he cried into his mate's shoulder. "I can't believe it; we're gonna be parents. Kami, we have to prepare. Naruto, when Mating Season is over, we have to get started right away getting ready. Birthing a demon child, especially in a male's case, is a bit of an occasion. We'll need a cradle, a safe environment, be able to be at our child's side every waking moment." His mate looked very nervous. "The explanation can wait. May I feel our offspring?" Naruto of course did not refuse. Kyuubi used his right hand and chakra to sense out the small life currently inside his mate. He stopped and hovered over one spot, and Naruto could feel both relief and joy coming through his mark. "It is strong, so very alive. Naruto, you are beautiful."</p><p>"I guess we need to start coming up with names," the blond suggested.</p><p>"That's right," his mate spoke anxiously. "It'll be a canine, as both of us are. Wow, there are so many when you think about it. Wait, we need to tell someone. Let's go tell Gaara and the others." Naruto pulled him back down before he sprung out of the room naked. "Oh, I should get dressed."</p><p>"First," Naruto began. "I'd like to kiss and rest just a bit longer." That voice was so soft and irresistibly cute. Kyuubi of course cuddled up with his mate and held him close, the one who would birth their pup.</p><p>An hour later, both young men came into Gaara's office. Shukaku and Gaara's siblings were all in here too, and no one else was there to disturb them. Kyuubi soundproofed the room before taking Naruto's hand in his own. "Gaara, everyone, we have some news," Naruto began. Shukaku raised an eyebrow, but he was curious and willing to listen to his king. "Kyuubi and I, are gonna have a pup." The news lingered in the air for a very tense ten seconds. Gaara's brain was now in the rebooting process, Temari was doing the equation in her head, and Kankuro was stunned in some other dimension. The first to regain speech was Shukaku, and he seemed very excited.</p><p>"Really? Are you sure?" he asked, receiving a nod from both young men. The tanuki sniffed the air. "Wow, you two really had to try didn't you?" Everyone blushed, including Kyuubi. "Well, it would be a miracle if it only took one try, but jeez you two went at it. I guess I'll send word to all the others. Eleven months from now, you two will be fathers. May I? Feel for the child?" Naruto looked to Kyuubi, and his mate nodded. The blond lifted his shirt, dried streaks of embarrassing evidence cracking upon his bare skin. "Further testimony to what I was saying before," Shukaku commented before he began feeling over the blond's stomach. "It's really healthy, and happy too."</p><p>"Naruto, you two really?" Gaara tried to ask. He received a nod when he could not find the words. "So soon though?"</p><p>"I'll explain everything to you guys later, but take a feel for yourselves. Humans can sense it too, demons having much stronger chakra signatures," Kyuubi told them. Temari was the first to do it.</p><p>"This is so incredible," she stated as she lightly rubbed over the same spot. She got a particular wave of a feeling, and it surprised her.</p><p>"It's laughing," Naruto stated. "It likes you. Come on Gaara." The redhead felt the chakra signature in disbelief. "Our child is curious. You feel like Shukaku, only a bit more human." The Tanuki and Gaara both huffed at the comment, and then they eyed each other in surprise. Kankuro fainted when he felt the little emanating glow of life. "Our child likes him too, says Kankuro is funny."</p><p>"Can it really talk?" Temari asked curiously, maternal instinct making her feel all needy to stay around the "mommy."</p><p>"No," Naruto told her. "But I can feel what it is thinking." Temari smiled.</p><p>"That is true of every demon parent, and some human mothers have the same ability to sense their children's feelings," Kyuubi stated before kissing his mate. "As of now, you are officially pregnant Naruto. Could we maybe get like a pot or bucket put next to our bed in case he gets sick?" Gaara nodded. "Thank you very much. Just tell everyone who gets curious that he caught a really stubborn stomach bug. It might not always be fun Naruto, but I can't wait to see the joy on your face when you finally see it in person." The blond teared up and smiled at just hearing those words. "It'll have your eyes."</p><p>"It'll have your heart," Naruto answered.</p><p>"It'll have your smile."</p><p>"It'll have your hair."</p><p>"It'll have both of your abilities to keep talking," Gaara commented. "I am happy for you guys, but don't get sappy on me."</p><p>"I'm sorry," Naruto told his friend. "I'm just…so relieved."</p><p><b>Thanks for Reading People. Review please. I miss all of your voices. the next chapt will be up soon enough.</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><p><b>Author Notes: Welcome back one and all. </b></p><p><b>#######################$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%&&&&&&&&&&&</b></p><p><b>Suna, Final Morning:</b> Mating Season had been fun this year for both the newly mated demons. Both of them wore one more reaffirmation, a golden sky with pure, white clouds. According to Kyuubi, it was the sign of a coming time of prosperity or joy. "That's what our offspring will give this world," the redhead had spoken. "I love you Naruto." It had given the fathers both a deeper sense of what was to come. The blond had begun his bouts of morning sickness, much to his mouth's displeasure. Kyuubi comforted him though, saying that nothing could make him seem less than he was.</p><p>"Wake up Naruto," Kyuubi sang. His blond mate was nestled with his head resting on the fox's chest. He groaned and turned over. "My mate, your heat is gone." Those words coupled with Kyuubi's shaking of his body had finally pulled the Juubi from his rest. He mentally studied himself.</p><p>No itchiness, no being flushed and hot, no inexplicable horniness, no weakness "thank Kami," Naruto spoke. He turned up to see his mate smiling down on him, and he kissed the fox. "So, time to head back to the village."</p><p>"Yup," Kyuubi replied. He nuzzled Naruto for a while before summoning clothes for them both, a bit more feudal style, kimono-like robes which had the most elegant pictures of each other. Beyond pictures, they moved! The two demon forms ran to each other, and then back around the fabric. Naruto was on the verge of tears, but then he felt something in the pit of his stomach. Kyuubi released him at feeling it through their marks. Naruto heaved into the bucket at their bedside before freezing the contents, the best way to rid the air of the smell. He had not yet had food, so there wasn't much to rid his system of.</p><p>"I'm beginning to feel sorry for all the women who have ever gotten pregnant," the blond commented before using a tissue to wipe his mouth. "I'm gonna drink some water. Meet me in Gaara's office." Kyuubi nodded before leaving the room. "Come on kid, you know I love you right? Can you give your daddy a break?" The answer from Naruto's still very very small pup was a forced dry heave, which hurt terribly. "Oh, you want food?" This answer was a strange warmth which Naruto had experienced only a couple times now. "Alright, some cold fruits and some bread, but nothing heavy right? I wouldn't want you getting sick from big people food." His little child was smiling at his father's humor. "I love you too." The blond left the room sparkling clean, fixed the bed, and brought the bucket with him to Gaara's office. The redhead was apprehensive to take it back. "Chuck it in the oasis and forget about it," his blond friend told him. "Anyway, here's the key, and we left the room nice and clean."</p><p>"Thank you very much Naruto-San," Gaara spoke before hugging his friend. "Good luck with everything. Have a few bites to eat, and we will see you off. By the way, bring me back some expensive demon clothing won't you?" He was eyeing the robes in wonder. The forms flowed like water, but they were so clear and vivid, and the colors were amazing too.</p><p>Naruto ate what he had promised his child, and he took some extra bits for the road. "I guess I won't be shoveling down ramen anymore," he commented. "I might have to give up my mom's cooking too. You don't know what you're missing until you've had a blueberry pancake made by her," he told his child.</p><p>"Naruto, I know talking to it brings you much joy, but don't do that around humans okay? They'll find you to be weird or even crazy, until you have a mound that is," Kyuubi warned. "I love you, but please refrain for a while. We will cross the desert quickly and then we can take our time getting back to Konoha." The blond nodded as he nibbled on a freshly made roll. Something about hot dough was so satisfying to the stomach, and the still invisibly small pup settled down happily knowing his or her feeding would come soon.</p><p>They set out from the hall, walking up to Suna's main gate. Gaara, Temari, Kankuro, and Shukaku gave them splendid farewells. "Make sure to invite us all Naruto-Sama," Shukaku told him. "I wanna see whether it ends up handsome like you or ugly like Kyuubi." The comment was in jest, but Kyuubi was once again ready to have fun with a raccoon chew toy. "Now go, the desert heat isn't good on a person's body, and it's worse on an unborn." Naruto and Kyuubi nodded, and they faded into the desert.</p><p><b>Kushina and Tsunade:</b> "They're coming back today right?" Naruto's mother asked.</p><p>"There'll be trouble if they don't," the Hokage commented. "I wouldn't worry overmuch; Naruto's plenty responsible when it comes to being on time, especially when it comes to you. He and Kyuubi are expected to be back by noon, so have everyone at the gate waiting for them. I'll join you if possible." The mountain of papers suggested that it wouldn't be possible.</p><p>Kushina was anxious to see her son again. He had seemed so happy being with Kyuubi, but he was afraid to show his friends the truth about himself…although he had no problems with exposing Kiba and Sasuke. As long as Naruto came back intact and not falling over drooling for Kyuubi in public, she'd be fine.</p><p>"He's coming back today," the brunette commented to his boyfriend. Sasuke breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>"Yes, the comic relief is finally returning," the raven spoke. "Do you know when?" Kiba gave him the look of "you seriously don't know?"</p><p>In synch, they said "lunch." And then they laughed a bit, Sasuke of course being far calmer about it. Sakura was busy at the vet fixing up a horse's broken leg. She wanted to be there when the blond hero returned. Ino had to beg her mother to shorten her shift at the flower shop. Chouji and Shikamaru were more easily available though. Hinata and Neji just had to finish up practice, and Lee was already waiting at the gate like a statue. Ten Ten needed someone to knock around because of a bad joke, so she anticipated Naruto's return as well.</p><p>Surprisingly, the entire Hidden Leaf Village was in a buzz, and here came Konohamaru to lighten the mood. "Get back here you freaking devil cat!" he yelled at Tora. He already had a bloody and sliced cheek, courtesy of her claws. Konohamaru pinned her at last, and Moegi crated the jittery creature. "Hah, can't escape Naruto's number one apprentice." The cat gave that high, right before attack growl/call, and Konohamaru's nose got sliced. The boy screamed and dropped the crate, letting the cat loose once more. "YOU," he spoke darkly and threateningly… "DAMNED FELINE!" The chase was on again, and the rookie nine couldn't help but laugh. Without Konohamaru, they never would have survived the month.</p><p>Kushina came up the road. It was exactly one minute to noon. Where in blazes were Naruto and Kyuubi? Since news had spread of their…relationship, a few of them guessed that Kyuubi and he were being naughty somewhere out in the wilderness. A gust of air and leaves spoke otherwise, both young men standing in the gateway.</p><p>"Noon on the nose," Sasuke spoke up. "Five bucks Sakura." The pink-haired girl and he had bet on whether or not they'd make it back before noon, and now she was grudgingly pulling out her wallet. Everyone huddled around Naruto, practically running over Kyuubi. "Hey, give him some air." Naruto jumped up to the top of the pole he had gone on when Jiraiya brought him back.</p><p>"It's good to be home," he sighed. Then it dawned on him again from a look from Kyuubi. "Oh, guys," Naruto began as he blurred down. "I have news, but we need to go see Tsunade too."</p><p>"They all know," Kushina stated. "I put in some embarrassment fail-safes for you. So, no longer in heat?" She hugged her son, and he was very happy to be back in his mother's arms. Naruto hugged back.</p><p>"No, I'm…well, not back to normal exactly," he commented. "I had a feeling Kiba or Sasuke would go blurting my secret to the rest of the rookie nine, but I have news besides that, and we still need to go to Tsunade's." A feeling hit his stomach, and Kyuubi cringed. "Oh no," the blond barely got out before expelling the small contents of his stomach. Everyone around him was curious and a bit afraid along with being grossed out. "That has a part to do with it," Naruto added after standing back up straight. Kyuubi held his hand and gave him a worried look. "I'll be fine." His comrades all followed him to the hospital, and the Hokage was currently delivering her mountain of papers.</p><p>Naruto!" she called happily. "Thank Kami you're finally back. It's been so boring without you." The blond hugged her back, despite the fact that his ribs were currently in danger. "So, everything back to normal?" she asked.</p><p>"Yes, and no," Naruto replied, obviously a bit uncomfortable. "Can we just go to a private room, ALL of us?" Tsunade seemed concerned and led them to an empty examination room.</p><p>"Something wrong Naruto?" she asked as he paled. The blond of course threw up in the garbage can and froze the contents. "Okay, that answers that question. Got any specifics for me? Time length, abdominal pain, bleeding?" The boy was breathing a bit hard. Kyuubi could feel what he was about to do.</p><p>"Guys, don't freak out on me please," he warned. "I'm only going to say this once, 'cause it's pretty embarrassing. I'm…pregnant with Kyuubi's and my pup." The last part was spoken quickly, and Naruto closed his eyes, waiting for the yelling. All he heard was Tsunade's pen leave her hand and hit the floor. His mate stood next to him, reassuringly holding his hand. Naruto looked at his shocked friends, all of them, even Tsunade, equally shocked. Well, his mother was probably the worst.</p><p>"You're…what?" the Hokage asked in disbelief.</p><p>"He said he wouldn't repeat it," Kyuubi replied flatly, angry, but in control. The air in the room was thick with the awkward feeling. "We're demons, live with it."</p><p>"You impregnated my son?!" Kushina asked hysterically and loudly at Kyuubi. Someone outside the door, make that quite a few people, heard everything. "What did you do to Naruto!" the woman screamed before attempting to punch the fox. It was her son who stopped her, his grip tight on her wrists, his eyes pointing to the floor, a single tear slipping and falling. "Naruto," she whispered, in fear and in sadness. "Are you certain?" It was the tiniest nod, but they all looked at some object to contemplate what had been heard. Kushina's arms fell to her sides, and Kyuubi hugged his mate close to him. "Why?" she asked. Kyuubi was about to roar at her, but Naruto had sent him a message through their bond.</p><p>"Because before the deal was done…I could hear it crying out for life," Naruto replied, quiet…serious…worried…but with conviction. "I don't kill people or things that I don't have to. I don't expect you to understand."</p><p>"Naruto," Tsunade began. "I hate to do this, but I do need to examine you, to see if this child of yours is healthily growing. Lay back on the table and lift your shirt.</p><p>"You dare make" Kyuubi began.</p><p>"It's fine," his mate spoke softly. "Calm yourself." Naruto kissed him lovingly, and Kyuubi made submissive and apologetic sounds. The blond undid his top to reveal a very hunky body, and the new reaffirmation.</p><p>"That's very astounding," the Hokage commented towards the design. "This is an ultrasound machine. It uses very fine sound waves to show us a picture of what is inside you." Naruto shivered, like everyone does, at the cold gel placed and spread out on his skin. Tsunade hooked the monitor up, and Naruto directed her hand. "Kami above," she spoke softly as she stared at the monitor. "This is…" Sakura nearly fainted. Kushina did. And most of the guys had a very awkward sense of themselves. "How is this possible?" Tsunade asked in disbelief. "Not only do you have a child, but it's strong, growing, and you have no way to birth it, no canal or anything. You do realize that if one doesn't develop, you'll lose it as a fetus."</p><p>"I can explain that one," Kyuubi spoke up. He wasn't sure how Naruto would react, so he whispered it in the Godaime's ear. "Our medical practitioners are very skilled. There is little you would need to worry about. Can you tell the gender?" Tsunade was a bit frazzled, and Naruto had to hold her hand steady to keep it from shaking.</p><p>"You'll have a very healthy young boy on your hands you two," she stated before drawing the equipment away, separating Naruto from the image of his pup. "I need a moment."</p><p>"And we need a few as well," Kyuubi stated as he helped his mate back into his robe. "I'll take Kushina-San back home." He took the woman piggyback, but when the door opened, Kyuubi was internally enraged by what he could see, smell, and hear. "Damn," he spoke before shutting the door. Everyone behind him was curious. "Naruto, you and I will slip out the window. It would seem your beliefs had good founding. There are people out there who spoke of things I will not tell you. Tsunade…keep everyone else safe." Naruto and he jumped from the window into the streets and shot off toward the Uzumaki Mansion.</p><p>"Kyuu," the blond began as they stood in the front yard. "What did you hear?" The fox found himself to be trapped by numerous razor-sharp ice pins. He didn't want to tell his mate this, but there could not be any avoiding it.</p><p>"Naruto, we cannot stay here," Kyuubi stated. "They called you an abomination!" he yelled, tears falling from his eyes, chakra blowing apart Naruto's entrapment. His mate just stood there, perhaps stunned. "They called you gay, a fag, a demon…a demon whore. Damn it Naruto don't make me say this to you." The fox had collapsed on his knees. Naruto was in shock. "They…said they'd" sniffle, "kill you…your child." Kyuubi was so quiet, and now Naruto was crying.</p><p>He fell to his knees…shaking, tearing, falling in darkness. "They," the blond began. "They won't…….THEY WON'T HAVE THE CHAAAAAANCE!" Naruto roared, Kikánugan blazing, both marks glowing white. Kyuubi had never felt such rage. In this state, Kyuubi watched the ten chakra tails form, and then came the danger. A wind more chilling than any other blew over the land. The fox covered Kushina, chanting words to a fire ninjutsu. Naruto's roar was heard by the Leaf Village, and all turned to see the red aurora formed into an enraged face. Shards, no, blades of ice began falling from the sky, and the wolf appeared in the forest. Everything he breathed upon froze completely and shattered. Kyuubi knew he couldn't let his mate keep going, and he allowed himself to transform. Naruto in his state could not recognize his loved one.</p><p>"Naruto!" Kyuubi roared. "Wake up Naruto." White chakra gathered in the enormous beast's maw, and the fox barely dodged the freezing bullet which flew past him. The sky filled with clouds, more lethal knives falling over the village. Tsunade had gotten most people into their homes or underground, but there were casualties. Kyuubi could barely do anything against his mate's wrath. "Please stop this mate!" Naruto bit him in the leg, and while the fox felt the pain and the ice work into his system, he managed to bite down on Naruto's mating mark. The Kikánugan spun, the marks lost all glow, and the two titans fell still, everything…still. The progression of freezing was stopped, but Kyuubi would lose that leg soon if it weren't thawed. "Naruto, please," his mate spoke, even with the blood in his mouth and the pain he wallowed in. He nuzzled the Bijuu king, and the golden eyes faded to blue. "Naruto?"</p><p>"Kyuubi," he whispered before his form began reverting to its human stature. The fox quickly began healing the wound of his mating mark, and he saw that Kushina had been unharmed. "Kyuubi, your leg."</p><p>"I'm gonna lose it, so what?" the redhead spoke with all the confidence he had, even though he was afraid.</p><p>"No," Naruto spoke, hugging that leg. Something, perhaps his love of Kyuubi, perhaps his absorption ability, or perhaps something else, thawed the fox's leg. He gave his chakra to the fox, healing the wound, before losing consciousness. The blond's friend's came running, all of them afraid.</p><p>"May this village be cursed," Kyuubi told them. "May every human who has ever scorned my mate be cursed!" he yelled. "We aren't safe here. Neither my mate nor my pup is safe here. There will come a day when you need Naruto's help, and when that day comes, don't expect him to answer."</p><p>"Guys, get out of here," Tsunade yelled. "The villagers, they're rioting. Get Naruto and Kushina out of here. All of you run!"</p><p>"I'll tell him how much you all said you'll miss him, because I know that's the truth," Kyuubi spoke. "Get his mother away from here. Naruto would be crushed if harm fell upon her. Goodbye, my friends," the fox spoke before he closed his eyes. Hand sign after hand sign fell into place, and a separate landscape seemed to appear behind the fox demon. He stopped long enough to look at them all once more. "At least you…cared for him." Kyuubi carried the unconscious blond across the invisible line connecting the two worlds, and then the window crumbled. A tear fell from the fox's eye before the window closed. "You are safe mate. You are safe." Kushina woke just in time to see the tear fall, and her scream of Naruto's name reached Kyuubi's ears. "I am sorry, Kushina-San." The fox prayed to the entities above that he could be forgiven. Tearing apart a family was no small sin. He was broken from his state though as the blond began stirring.</p><p>"W-Where am I?" he asked, the unfamiliar golden fields disorienting him. His eyes fell on Kyuubi. "Kyuu?" Naruto began with tears coming to the fold. "What did I do?"</p><p>"Nothing Naruto," his mate told him. "Your village abandoned you…not your friends of course," he added after his mate became even more saddened. "Mate, you are safe here. This is the demon world. No one will hurt you here; you are safe."</p><p>"What happened to Mom?" he asked.</p><p>"She is not happy with me, but your mother"</p><p>"WILL KILL HIM!" the woman roared out. "Let me go Tsunade. I'm gonna kill him for this." The Hokage could barely hold her back. "I know you can hear me Kyuubi! Give back my son! Give him back." She collapsed on her knees crying. "Just let me see him Kyuubi."</p><p>"Kushina, let it go," the Hokage told her. "Kyuubi did what he had to do to keep the one he loved safe. Doesn't that mean anything to you?" The woman froze. "Naruto would be turning eighteen soon anyway. Just let him go," she yelled in a hurt voice, tears falling from her eyes too. "He's safe. Naruto is safe. That's what counts Kushina. You know how much he loves you, and he won't abandon any of us. Naruto isn't dead. He isn't here, but he's alive. If he stayed here, he might have died. Poison, night attacks, they'd do anything to kill him now that they know. Wait until Naruto returns. He won't abandon you. I know it."</p><p>"Tsunade-Sama!" she wailed. It was too painful, all of it just too much for her to bear. Villagers could be heard in the distance, but Tsunade sent every ANBU she had to now quell them. Naruto's friends sadly helped his mother into her house, and they all stayed the night, too sad, too tired, and too afraid to leave. What was true? If only they could see the blond, KNOW he was truly alright.</p><p>Kyuubi held his sobbing mate close to him, and their scent drifted into the distance. This window was one Kyuubi knew lead to a close personal friend. Nibi's brother, Fusukayu, lived in a large house nearby. The redhead refused to move Naruto at all in this state. His instincts forced him to comfort his broken mate. "Shhhh Naruto, please rest," he spoke quietly as he rocked them slowly back and forth. Kyuubi changed his scent, made comforting noises, and rubbed his mate's back to keep the boy calm. He also nuzzled the blond, licking away the tears which marred his pure face. "I won't ever leave you Naruto. I love you." His mate cried himself to sleep, and within seconds of this, Fusukayu blurred into sight. "Please my old friend, help me, just a little." The three-tailed tiger man nodded.</p><p>"Do you need a place to stay old friend?" he asked, calmly and quietly. Kyuubi nodded. "I have a spare room if you require it…and some permanent clothes which I can lend to your mate."</p><p>"How did you?"</p><p>"It is the end of the season, who else could he be?" he asked. "It has been nearly twenty years. What finally brings you back here Youko?" Kyuubi rose, carrying his troubled mate in his arms bridal style. "What brings your loved one to be so sad?"</p><p>"We have left the human world," the redhead began. "You would not believe it, but he was once human."</p><p>"I have seen six-thousand years," Fusukayu replied. "Plus, Zant has known since the beginning of the last month. There have been human to demon transformations in the past, but <i>he</i> is by far the most unique. Still, why have you brought him from his kind?"</p><p>"They have scorned him, abandoned him," Kyuubi spoke solemnly as he stared sorrowfully at Naruto's twisted face. "They wished to kill our pup. I had no choice." Fusukayu stopped in his tracks and turned.</p><p>"You and he have"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Youko, my friend this is great news. Ah, I can smell it now, but it is faint, or perhaps simply overpowered. How old?"</p><p>"He is nearly twenty days into carrying, but according to the human medical specialist in his village, our pup is very strong. It will be a male," Kyuubi spoke. "She was one of the few who truly cared for my mate, shielding him from harm, comforting him, training him. But the common people who follow her…I will not say it again." Fusukayu put his hand on Kyuubi's shoulder. Only a very select few could pull that off and walk away without a scratch.</p><p>"I understand. Humans are foolish," the silver-haired tiger replied. He looked down at the truthfully sleeping beauty in his friend's hands. "Well, most of them anyway. You two have obviously had a rough day; I will not harry you for information. This is strange, being sorry and congratulating you at the same time. I guess…good luck, sums it up?" Kyuubi smiled. Fusukayu was one of the few who he could turn to for support and not be ashamed for it. "You may stay in my house as long as you wish." They blurred to his house, Kyuubi sighing that he had gotten his mate to a place in which he could rest. "I am sorry if it smells too much of mating. I will try to"</p><p>"It is no problem," Kyuubi told his friend. "He has already begun having morning sickness. Could you" Fusukayu had a bucket in hand almost instantly. "Thank you." The tiger-man showed Kyuubi to the rather lavish guest quarters, and he watched as his friend placed his mate softly beneath the covers. "Do you have any fresh bread or something light on the stomach? Naruto will wish to eat when he wakes."</p><p>"Yes, and if you are up to it, you may join me for dinner this evening," his friend spoke before softly shutting the door.</p><p>Kyuubi laid down next to his mate, nuzzling him and comforting the boy in his sleep. "I won't leave you Naruto, not ever," he whispered. That night was full of events. Naruto awoke in shambles, his emotions running wild. Fusukayu had been wounded by his claws, luckily not poisoned. The blond cried and held himself, and he kept begging Kyuubi to let him see his mother and his friends. His fox however was adamant, and he held the only way for the blond to get back to his dimension. Despite instinct, Kyuubi knew letting Naruto back to his world would be dangerous for both him and their pup. He refused despite his mark's searing answer. Kyuubi had to make sure his mate suffered minimal stress. It would be bad for their child. He licked the blond's mark, pinning his body in relaxation, eventually making the mental rollercoaster slow down as well. "When the time is right, we will go back Naruto. I cannot tear you forever from your family, but I cannot let you walk back to your own peril either," Kyuubi told him softly. "Just eat a little bit my mate. You need to nourish both yourself and your child." Naruto froze. He could feel his pup's fear, and it sickened him to be the one who had caused it.</p><p>"Will you promise to bring me back before my friends and family die?" Naruto asked his mate. Kyuubi of course nodded sincerely. The blond ate some warm bread and drank some cold milk before crawling into the bed Fusukayu had given them. "I'm still mad," Naruto stated.</p><p>"You have every right to be," Kyuubi replied as he gave his mate what reassuring touches his instincts gave him. "But do you forgive me?" there was no answer for a long time, and it crushed the fox's heart.</p><p>"I…know what you did was meant to protect me, but it hurts alright?" the blond finally spoke. "I love you, so yes; I forgive you…as long as you keep your promise." His fox wrapped his arms around him. "I refuse to have sex with you until after our child is born though." That was no idle threat, and now Kyuubi felt afraid. Maybe if the blond forgot, six or seven months from now? "If you can go that long, it's love. If you keep pestering me…I'll run where you can't find me."</p><p>"That isn't possible," the fox replied. "But I understand. I will wait. Naruto?" His mate turned to him.
