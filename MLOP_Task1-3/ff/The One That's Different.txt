Naruto was only 6 years old but could already keep up with Anbu in speed and out last them in stamina at full speed. He was also smarter than all of the other children, but he wore an emotional and physical mask to keep from being hurt and to make others underestimate him so life was easier. While the may be better than others his age he was no match for the Anbu's attacks. All he felt was a blunt strike to the back of his head and then everything went black</p><p>When he woke up he heard dripping water. He was lying on the floor in a sewer-like tunnel. Then he heard the faint calling of a soft feminine voice calling out to him. As he walked it was getting warmer and warmer as well as dryer and dryer. As he was walking he saw a lit room. When he walked in, there was a giant cage with a flimsy piece of paper with the word seal on it. The voice sounded like it was getting closer and closer. Finally a beautiful woman came into view. She had nine bushy tales waiting behind her, two fox years on top of her head, but what caught his attention the most was, that she was crying.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p><b>So what do u think?!</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Why
are you crying? He wondered outloud. She tensed when she heard
his voice. She looked up shakely at him and burst into tears. 
I'm so sorry that close to so much pain and misery. What are
you talking about? She stopped crying slightly. I'm the
Kybuui no Kitsune and I'm sealed within you. So what does it
matter. What's done is done. There's no use in
dwelling on the past. There's only the future to worry about,
and with the way it's looking were been me to do a lot of training
for the future if we're going to survive.</P><P><U><B>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</B></U></P><P><U><B>So

before I could type it so I had to improvise. The next chapter will
be longer I </B></U><U><B>and</B></U><U><B>REVIEW

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Naruto,
now 10 years old, is now able to both out run an Anbu in both speed
and stamina, as well as fight kages and win without a problem. He
also had near limitless chakra due to his exteam amount of training
with Kybuui. When he has to he can have a limitless supply of chakra
because of his connection with Kybuui. We find our masked genius in a
shitty apartment building. <U><B>"</B></U><U><B>Why
must you live in this place"</B></U>
Kybuui asked via their mind link."Because until I become an actual
shinobi I can't afford anything else." Naruto answered. <U><B>"Well
then why do you always fail the gennin exam on purpose when we both
know that you can pass it without a sweat!?!?!"</B></U>Kybuui
exclaimed."Because if I were to pass I would end up on an
unbearable team."He answered.<U><B>"But
you'll end up on an unbearable team anyway!"</B></U>Kybuui
exclaimed."No I will not."Naruto explained"I need to be on the
same time as the Uchiha."Naruto continued.<U><B>"Why!?!?!"</B></U>Kybuui
exclaimed confused."I'll explain later."Naruto thought.<U><B>"GRRR.
Why are you so secretive?!?!"</B></U>Kybuui
questioned."because it's the only thing that keeps me cut off from
the outside world and keeps my emotions in check."Naruto thought
very sadly and began to look depressed.<U><B>"Dammit
Kybuui now look at what you've done!"</B></U>Kybuui
said cursing herself for not paying attention to her kit's feelings
and mental stability.</P><P><U><B>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</B></U></P><P><U><B>Well
what do you think!?!?! Review plz</B></U></P><P><U><B>Oh

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>Ok first things first I'm gonna go in
to more detail in the next chapter and second Kyuubi and Naruto have
worked to fix the seal that was fucking up his chakra control and
reserves, strength, and intelligence but with the nearly endless
knowledge of Kybuui helping him he quickly learned to fix the seal.
All of this was done at a very young age. SO GET OFF MY BACK YOU
ASSHOLES!</P><P>P.S this is only for the flamers!</P>
