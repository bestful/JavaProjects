I wonder what happened after the Kyubi was sealed, and if Naruto is fine and if Dad is fine too." Said a voice in the middle of the forest of Fire Country, His name is Ren Isamu, a 15 year old boy. He's 5'10 height and his skin is a little tanned. He has spiked white colored hair and eyes color dark green that shine even in the darkness of the night. He was not overly muscular like a bodybuilder on steroids, but more like an swimmer build. He wears a blue sleeveless muscle shirt, dark blue pants with pockets, for scrolls if needed, black shinobi sandals, and finally a long sleeveless dark blue trench coat. On the front was the kanji for Lion King and on the back was the kanji for "Beast King" and a White Lion stitched in the back. He's also wearing a pair of dark blue fingerless gloves with metal bands on them. Along with his kunai pouch strapped to his right thigh and shuriken pouch on his left. A headband with the kanji for Courage and in his neck there a pendant of a white colored heart and the scroll of Lion summoning sealed in a blood seal in his right bicep, and a spear made of the hardest metal in all the shinobi world, the metal was the hardest, and also the most flexible, with just a bit of aura, or his chakra it would go from a spear, to a lethal whip like spear, the name of the spear was "Leo Rex"(Lion King) strapped to his back, he also had a bow called "Justus Virtus" (Righteous Force), sealed in his right arm.</p><p>As Ren was running in the great forest of Fire country, he remembered the time when he protected Naruto from some mobs when on Ninja duty, and just being there for the child, even if it was in the shadow and given him some gifts, sadly his power over Aura control were going haywire and he have to go to Makai (Hell) to control his powers and hone his skill Futon<b> (Wind Style)</b>, Suiton <b>(Water Style)</b>, Hyoton <b>(Ice Style)</b> Kenjutsu <b>(Art of the Sword)</b>, Ninjutsu<b> (Ninja Techniques)</b> Genjutsu <b>(Art of Illusion)</b> and his Taijutsu <b>(Art of hand-to-hand Combat)</b> the Beast King style.</p><p>"I just don't know why Kami-sama wanted me to come to this place again." Finished Ren as he left the road, opting more for the branches of the trees than gave him more speed, than the ground of the forest.</p><p>"<b>I know you don't like to be given orders, but today is October 10th and if what Kami-sama says was true, you must go to Konoha if you want to help that child"</b><b>. </b>Replied Kenta a white lion demon. that is running beside him in his beast-demon form. The lion pretty much tease him and it always finish with an atomic blush from Ren that could put a certain blue-ish haired shy Hyuga to shame and with the Lion-man hugging him, but judging by the tone in his voice, all playfulness was out of the window.</p><p>"I know today October 10th why do you think I'm gathering enough chakra to my legs to exhaust a Kage level shinobi to get there in time!." Shouted an exasperated green-eyed boy, they has been doing this since his Portal from Hell ended him close to Kumo and just to his luck, a patrol was nearby and detected the use of chakra and when to investigate, and to make story short they had run a lot.</p><p><b>"I know that!</b><b>.</b><b> But the child is in danger!</b><b>.</b><b> Even with that</b><b> stupid</b><b> fox sealed in him a fatal attack still could kill him, and why the hell are you complaining you have more chakra </b><b>than a five tailed beast, I don't see why you should complain</b><b>".</b> Stated Kenta with a glare in Ren's direction as he put more demonic chakra and a little wind manipulation to his legs, to speed his running and hopefuly get in Konoha before the shit hit the fan.</p><p>"Okay fine… how much longer is Konoha?' Asked the tired green-eyed young man, as he put more chakra in his legs to match the speed of the lion.</p><p><b>"Just a couple more miles and </b><b>we will get</b><b> there, but your chakra is too high, mask your chakra could you, we don't want another incident like in Kumo". </b>Responded Kenta. He shuddered, remembering that crazy cat chick and the Biju of 2 tails sealed in her, if what he remembered was correct, it was the Nibi No Nekomata, the cat that was condemned to be horny almost all the time, he shuddered again thanking all that is holy to not fight her when she is in that stage, before suppressing their chakra to not make suspicion has they got near the village.</p><p><i>'Don't worry Naruto I will never let them hurt you anymore'. </i>thought the white haired boy, pleading to Kami-sama that the kid is not too harmed before they get there.</p><p><b>-Konoha Festival-</b></p><p>October 10th</p><p>It was the night of the Kyuubi festival and the village of Konohagakure was filled with the sounds of joy and laughter; everywhere except one particular area of the village. If anyone were to investigate this area, they would see a mod of drunken villagers and a few ninja chasing a young boy with bright blonde hair, cerulean blue eyes, three whisker-like markings on each cheek, and wearing a bright orange "I'm here come and kill me" jump suit crying out things like "Demon!" and "Monster!" The reason this young boy was running was because he was 9 year old Naruto Uzumaki, the container for the Nine Tailed Demon Fox and the village pariah and the son of the 'Yellow Flash' Yondaime Hokage. To many foolish villagers Naruto was viewed as the fox reborn, but this wasn't true. Naruto was just a scared little kid who was chased on a regular basis for a reason that no one would tell him about.</p><p>"THERE'S THE MONSTER"</p><p>"DEMON"</p><p>"MURDERER"</p><p>"TODAY YOU DIE DEMON"</p><p><i>'Why are they doing this to me, I never hurt them or did nothing wrong, why, why am I hated?' </i>Thought our little jinchuriki of the Kyubi no Kitsune, sadly he doesn't know that he has the all 'powerful' Fox sealing in his gut, but maybe today will be different for our little Naruto.</p><p>"MONSTER TODAY WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY KILL YOU." Shouted a shinobi from the groups of villager, all of them were throwing broken bottles, knives, kunai, or anything they can get there hands on.</p><p><i>'I got to get away, must get away from them'. </i>Naruto turned to another corner and to just his luck another mob was waiting in the other side for him.</p><p>Naruto had been cornered; the villagers and ninjas were tapping their weapons against their palms with sick grins on their faces.</p><p>"You can't escape DEMON" A kunai hit his legs and shuriken were launched to his back and a chakra packed punch from a shinobi broke his arm.</p><p>"AHHHH" Shouted Naruto the pain was horrible, he hug is own body to try and protect himself from the punches, knives, broken bottles and the things the mob were throwing and hitting him with, he could feel eyes watering but he refuse to let the villager see him cry and let them know the pain that they were causing him.</p><p>"Now is when you die demon," Screeched a pink-haired villager, raising a carving knife above her head.</p><p><i>'I guess this is it, thank you Oji-san, Ayame-nee-chan, Old man Teuchi, for taking care of me</i><i>'</i>. Naruto thought sadly waiting for his death until…</p><p>CLANG</p><p><b>-10 minutes early-</b></p><p>"*pant…pant* finally I-We made it". Say the tired green eyed young man Ren Isamu. As he and Kenta were entering the village looking for Naruto</p><p>When he made to the gate the guards stopped asking what his business was to the village, he showed his passport showing that he was from the village and when they asked for the Big white lion by his side he say that Kenta was his partner like the dogs from the Inuzuka clan and that he will not cause any trouble so long that he's not attack.</p><p><b>"Remember what we have come here for?" </b>Asked Kenta, feeling something was wrong as he looked at the village, everywhere, he saw the villager were drinking, singing, dancing or muttering something about 'joining a fox hunt'.</p><p>Kenta was angry at this <i><b>'Stupid ningen the lot of them, that don't know the difference between a kunai and the scroll that contain them'.</b></i></p><p>"Yeah I know…to find Naruto Uzumaki and talk to Old man Hokage about the improvement of my powers". Replied Ren also feeling something was wrong in the air and he was feeling worried as people were talking about a fox hunt.</p><p><i>'Surely they aren't talking about-' </i>Ren was startled when he hear the cry of 'Monster', 'Demon' and the pained cry of a young boy.</p><p><i>'Shit!</i><i>.</i><i> Are we to late, please Kami-sama</i>…'He didn't finish his thought as they saw, when they turned a corner of the street, what have they done to the Child.</p><p>"Kami-sama…" He could feel his blood boiling with rage and Kenta growling for what they were seeing.</p><p>In front of him they were mobs of villager and in the middle of them was a blood stained form of Naruto, the villager were shouting for the child dead, just has a pink haired woman make his way to the child with a carving knife.</p><p>A puff of smoke envelop the big white lion before in his place stood. A very muscular 6'10 height Lion-man, he has sapphire colored eyes with slitted pupils and long black hair-mane with white strips, the hair reached his shoulders and he have lion ears, big canines that jutted from his upper lips, and 3 white lion tails waging behind. And feet and hands with big black claws that were covered in black bandages. He have no shirt, leaving his upper body for all to see, black ninja pants, red and gold knuckles bracers and a large coat worn over its shoulders that is color black outside and inside is crimson red.</p><p>"I get the child, stop those idiots". Said Ren readying himself for anything that could go wrong <i>'Not like it could get any worse than this'</i></p><p><b>"Hai let's get them!" </b>Replied Kenta, as he took his sword from his sheath, to block the incoming knife from the pink Harpy</p><p>They rushed just before the knife was imbedded in the chest of the child.</p><p><b>-Present time-</b></p><p>"Now is when you die demon," Said a pink-haired villager, raising a carving knife above her head. Suddenly, there was a loud CLANG and the pink haired woman found that her blade was being blocked by what looked like a Demonic (to her and the mob behind her) man with what appeared to be a, small silver Tanto with the Kanji for Justice engraved in the blade and a black scabbard with a Roaring white Lion. The blade is two-edged. While she was distracted the 'Demon's' other fist, came forward and slammed the woman in the stomach, knocking her backward into the crowd. Behind him was what the villagers could only be described as young boy wearing a long sleeveless, dark blue trench coat. As the boy walked to Naruto and kneel down and ask with a concerned voice.</p><p>"It's ok little one, you're safe now". Ren said to Naruto. While he was nervous, Naruto heard the kindness in his voice and reached out to take his hand.</p><p><b>"You got the kid </b><b>Ren</b><b>?" </b>Kenta asked as he blocked an incoming kunai strike form a chunin, and punchin the fool in the gut, sending him to the crown of stupid villagers, and causing a funny bowling effect.</p><p>"Yeah, Kenta, I have him." The green-eyed young boy replied as he looked for injuries on the child body.</p><p>Ren bent down and began checking the child for injuries while asking, "Are you okay little one, did those people hurt you?" He asked in a sweet and caring voice filled with concern. The young boy, however, was what caught most of the villagers attention. He was instantly recognized as the son in all but blood of their Hokage, Ren Isamu who had been travelling abroad, so they believe.</p><p>Naruto only shook his head shocked that these people seemed to be trying to help him instead of hurting him as was the norm.</p><p>One very nervous shinobi stepped forward and asked, "L-Lord Isamu w-what are you doing here."</p><p>Ren instantly turned his attention away from Naruto and a deep glare filled his features.</p><p>"That's just what I was going to ask you bastards. What the hell is wrong with you people!. Attacking a child like this, have you all lost your minds!" He finished in an enraged roar and a bit of Killing Intent or KI.</p><p>Many villagers looked intimidated by the man's rage, but one idiot, the same one knocked out by Kenta punch stepped forward and shrieked back, "That is no child, it's a demon. Now Lord Isamu I suggest you and your <i>friend</i>," she hissed the word while glaring daggers at Kenta who just returned the glare, "leave before you are hurt." she finished threateningly, with the rest of mob shouting their encouragement. The man may have been their leader's son but they weren't going to let him and the 'freak' stand in their way of finnaly killing the 'fox'.</p><p><b>"How can you call an innocent child a demon, you heartless whore"</b><b>.</b>Growled Kenta, glaring at her, wishing her body would burst into flames.</p><p>"Silence you freak, you know nothing and should remain quiet while your betters are speaking." shrieked the pink-haired woman, enraged that the demon was talking back at his superiors.</p><p>The woman's arrogance was really getting on Ren's last nerve. With a twisted idea. He decided to learn exactly what was going on in the village over the past 6 years he'd been absent and silence the loud-mouthed bitch as well in one fell swoop.</p><p>"Well then," he spoke with a sinister grin, "let's just find out what is going on then." He phased out of view of the villager and instantly was in front of the harpy, his hand instantly shot out and grabbed the pink-haired bitch by her oversized forehead. In an instant Ren bright midnight blue Aura swirled around his hand and enveloped the woman's head.</p><p>In an instant all the woman's memories of the boy came into Ren's head. He saw the Third's explanation of what the boy contained and his message about how the boy was to be seen as a hero, and the woman's, along with most of the remainder of the village, decision to ignore. He saw the attacks, beatings, and assassination attempts the woman had helped plan or attended, as well as her and the rest of the council's actions to make the boy's life miserable: his banning from the stores and overcharging of items. Ren's already angry mind flew into a dead rage. "You fucking bitch!" He screamed while drawing his spear and…</p><p>SWISH</p><p>…off came the woman's arm.</p><p>The woman fell to the ground screaming while the rest of the mob stood still, stunned by their leader's son sudden act of, to them, unprovoked rage. Kenta looked at him curiously before asking, <b>"Damn, what you saw in the lady's head to make you go executioner on her"</b><b>.</b></p><p>Ren looked at his fellow Companion and Partner with a look of barely contained rage.</p><p>"I'll show you." He stated coldly while raising his hand. Instantly a bolt of Aura hit Kenta downloading what Ren had just seen into his mind. The knowledge made the already angered Lion Pissed, Kenta's eyes were glowing a deep baleful blue and saying Kenta was pissed would be the understatement of the century.</p><p>His claws were both fully extended gathering demonic chakra to <b>Fudokusou</b> <b>("Necrotoxin Claw")</b> the bastards and a feral snarl was plastered across his face as he prepared to leap into the mob and start ripping it apart.</p><p>Sensing the killing intent, several of the ninja in the mob threw weapons at them, but they were intercepted and destroyed by Ren's <b>Reiki</b><b>ken (Aura Fist)</b> and Kenta's <b>Jūoudaken</b> <b>("Beast-King Fallen Fist")</b>. Before any of them could start their counter a new voice broke in.</p><p>"ENOUGH!" shouted the voice. Instantly standing between the mob and the enraged Kenta and Ren was none other than Hiruzen Sarutobi, the Third Hokage surrounded by a several squads of Anbu. As the crowd began to calm, believing their leader had come to save them from his maddened son and his freak.</p><p>Their hopes were soon dashed as the Hokage stated, "Anbu take these villagers to Ibiki for interrogation and punishment." Hearing a groan from the ground he added, "Oh and take Mrs. Haruno to the hospital before she bleeds to death," he added as an afterthought, "before taking her to Ibiki." he finished.</p><p>As the mob cried out their shock and fear, the Third turned to Ren and Kenta and said, "Hello my boy, it's good to see you home again." stated the Hokage with a small smile.</p><p>Ren's voice and look remained icy as he glared at the man before saying, "I wish I could say the same Dad, but we have a lot to discuss. Like how you've let your village get so out of control that mobs are now attacking innocent children." He stated coldly while glaring at his dad in all but blood.</p><p>Sarutobi knew that look and that voice from her mother.</p><p><i>'</i><i>I'm screwed</i><i>'. </i>thought the Hokage as he led the Ren, Kenta and Naruto to his office. His son had refused to let the boy out of his sights.</p><p><b>-Hokage Office-</b></p><p>"I wish you could have come at a better time Ren." The aged Hokage said sadly. "Much has changed since you left."</p><p>"I'll say!" Ren roared causing Sarutobi to flinch. "When I left you were stepping down as Hokage, giving the job to one of Jiraiya's students. Granted you got an excuse to be back after I leaned that the Fourth died fighting the Kyuubi and sealing him inside Naruto, but you're the Hokage damn it! Can't you do more to keep those psychotic, idiotic fools from hunting him down like he was some animal!" he panted after his rant staring at his surrogate father with a look that would have put the Shinigami to shame.</p><p>Sarutobi continued to flinch at the words and the icy glare that filled his son's gaze. "Ren, you must understand," he tried to reason with his irate son, "I've done whatever I could to help the boy these last 9 years, but, for the most part, the council has…"</p><p>"Screw the fucking council!" Roared Ren. "You're the Hokage, the leader, the head honcho, the boss. Those bastards can only override your authority if they have proof of negligence or corruption that they can present to the Lord of Fire, and I doubt they can convince him that protecting a child is treasonous behavior. The truth of the matter is Dad, you've gotten weak-assed." he finished coldly, but in the back of his mind, he was sweating bullet, even if Ren could fight a A class ninja or a Demon and win with the help of Kenta or his summons, there was no way he could defeat his Dad, there was a reason he was called "The God Of Shinobi" and "The Profesor".</p><p>Sarutobi stood up at this. "Now see here, son. I have not…"</p><p>"You haven't?" interrupted the white-haired shinobi, "Then what happened to Hiruzen Sarutobi, the Professor, the God of Shinobi? Where's the man that could send entire armies running with single scowl? Cause' I know he isn't sitting in here letting a bunch of civilians and retired shinobi push him around."</p><p>Sarutobi sat back down, a shocked look on his elderly features. <i>'He's right. What have I let myself be reduced to? A figurehead? A clerk, filling endless amounts of useless paper? No more. It's time those bastards remember who wears the hat in this village</i><i>'.</i>thought the elderly Hokage with a determined look plastered across his aged features.</p><p>He stood once again. "You know Ren, you're right. I've gotten complacent in my old age, but that ends now. If those bastards think they can push the Professor around anymore then they're in for a rude awakening". He said with a malicious smirk.</p><p>Ren smiled and leaned forward to give his father a hug. "That's the Dad I know and love." he said with pride as they exited the room.</p><p><b>-Outside of the Hokage Office-</b></p><p><b>-10 minutes early-</b></p><p>Outside the room Kenta was standing with his back to the door giving a dark chuckle.</p><p>"He's really cutting into him isn't he?" Ren's clone with the orders of protectiong Naruto asked with a smirk.</p><p><b>"Ohhhhh yeah," </b>Kenta chuckled before glancing back at the kid. <b>"I can't believe that after all the hell this place has put him through, that the runt can still laugh." </b>Naruto was currently playing with a summoned lion, as the lion was bouncing off walls and hanging from various things with his tail all while under the watchful eyes of Kenta and Ren's clone.</p><p>"Maybe laughing is the only think that kept him sane all these years." The clone said solemnly. During his time on the streets whenever the shit would hit the fan he would just laugh it off and try to keep going or figure out a way of whatever mess he got himself into. "He actually reminds me a little of my boss, Kenta. From what I understand he's a quick healer and with the years maybe he will become a Hanyo too. Only thing he's missing are the claws." Kenta snorted and gave a small smile.</p><p><b>"Maybe.</b><b>"</b>grunted the three tailed lion with a thoughtful look. The door opened to show the Hokage and a slightly chipper Ren.</p><p>Suddenly an Anbu wearing a cat mask entered with a message as she bowed to the Hokage. "Hokage-sama the council wishes for you, Lord Isamu, Naruto-san and…his friend to the council meeting"</p><p>Sarutobi sighed before addressing the anbu "Tell them we're going" and with a dismissal hand, the anbu shunshined to the council room to relieve the message.</p><p>"What do they want now dad?" Asked Ren, annoyed that the council wish to speak with them.</p><p>"Probably is because of the stunt you two put early" Replied the Hokage as they walked to the Council room</p><p><b>-Council meeting room-</b></p><p>Hiruzen Sarutobi, the "God of Shinobi" also known as the "Professor" Ren Isamu, the "Beast King" also know as "Lion King" and Kenta the "White Lion" sighed, annoyed and was pissed because he and his son and friend had to sit in the council room listening to the civilian council try and have Naruto killed again and to arrest his son and to kill the "Freak" as they named Kenta or seal him in a baby...When will these idiots learn?</p><p>The council was made up of three groups.</p><p>One was the civilian council that was made up of important merchants or people who had political power in the village. They were the reason why Naruto was hated because they can't tell the difference between a kunai and the scroll that hold it.</p><p>The next one was the shinobi and clan council. They were made up of the 8 clan heads, which also looked annoyed and ticked at the civilian's whining and bitching. Seriously, why do they have civilians on the council when they know close to nothing about the Shinobi ways? The clan heads were Tsume Inuzuka, Shibi Aburame, Hiashi Hyuga, Fugaku Uchiha, Choza Akamichi, Shikaku Nara, and Inoichi Yamanaka.</p><p>Last were the Hokage advisors. There were his old teammates, Homura Mitokado and Koharu Utatane and his former rival for the Hokage position, Danzo. They wanted Naruto to become a weapon for Konoha especially Danzo.</p><p>"We need to kill that demon brat before he decides to kill us all! And arresting Lord Isamu and kill that Demon friend of your son too for interfering in civilian matters!" yelled a fat civilian merchant while the other civilians yelled in agreement. Tsume however had a tick mark growing on the side of her head while Shikaku muttered troublesome lazily while his teammates nodded.</p><p>"When will you idiots learn that the boy is not the demon, he's the container! And why arrest Lord Isamu and His Partner". Tsume yelled. She held no ill will towards Naruto because she had to on certain occasions rescue the boy from mobsters and let him occasionally hide in one the empty cabins in the compound. She may have lost half of her clan to the fox, but that doesn't make Naruto the bijuu and she also believed in the Yondaime and his skills in Fuuinjutsu (Art of Sealing).</p><p>Kenta ears twitched when he hears that, as he smirked and replaying the thought via mind-link to Ren <i><b>'</b></i><i><b>Sooo I'm your Partner Ren-kun</b></i><i><b>'. </b></i>Ren blushes hearing that.</p><p>"We're only trying to avenge Yondaime-sama! Why don't you get that through your hair filled ears Inuzuka!" screeched Rose Who- I mean Haruno who hated Naruto because of the fact that he's a miniature version of Minato and believe's that the fox is mocking them by looking like their deceased hero.</p><p>Tsume growled at the pink haired witch and flexed her claws. "Watch your mouth slut or I'll rip your organs out of your body and feed them to Kuromaru and his pups." She said in a dark voice while her partner snarled at the woman who was flinching in her seat.</p><p>Kenta was thinking while looking at Tsume <i><b>'I think I'm in love'.</b></i></p><p>Ren turned wide eyed to Kenta as he hear what he say in the mind-link and replied. <i>'What!'</i><i>.</i></p><p>Ren didn't know why, but his heart hurt for some reason hearing that.</p><p>Kenta turned to with a smirk and replied. <i><b>'Awww… are you jealous, don't worry I love you more than anything</b></i><i><b>'</b></i>. He truly does, but he doesn't want Ren to suffer mobs of people going for him because he was with a man and to make matter worse a Bijuu-demon, needless to say he couldn't bear himself if something happen to Ren because of him.</p><p>Ren previous thought were throw away as a deep blush was in his face and turned around to not see the smirk of the Lion but sadly that only turned the smirk in a full mischievous smile, as Kenta got behind Ren and hugged him.</p><p><i><b>'There, there no need to get anymore nervous'</b></i><i><b>. </b></i>Replied Kenta as he put his chin of top of Ren head and smile down at him</p><p>Ren could swear that the room just gotten brighter by the atomic blush now plastered in his face before calming down and feeling the muscle that Kenta has and accepting the hug</p><p><i>'For know</i><i>'. </i>Thought Ren, thanking all that is holy that nobody is seeing this, as the shinobi council was busy betting on Tsume as was the civilian council on Rose.</p><p>Kenta heart was in heaven watching Ren, accepting his hug and he hug him a bit more tight before letting go and back off so no one couldn't see this and make matters worse than they already were.</p><p>Ren got fuzzy when Kenta hug him tight, before feeling the warm that was his body go away.</p><p>Ren feel alone and a little cold when Kenta stop hugging him</p><p>He turned around to see why, only to see the leonine face serious and his head nodded toward the council as he turned around again to give his attention to the council ignoring the feeling of loneliness that filled his hearts before pushing those thought away.</p><p>The only one that saw this was Sarutobi, he was shocked, he know that his son like girls but it appears that he also like guys, well only Kenta if all the sign that he saw early was any indication to that.</p><p><i>'I guess he didn't tell me because he was afraid, don't worry son I do not hate you, I'm going to wait for you to tell me and I'm going to have a little talk to Kenta, nobody date my son if I don't have the final approval'. </i>Thought Sarutobi with dark chuckle in the end while planning a way for Kenta to tell him why he must let him date his son.</p><p>Sarutobi turned to the council still seeing about to kill each other, hell Tsume and Rose were about to tear each other apart</p><p>'<i>I hate my job'</i><i>. </i>thought Sarutobi.</p><p>This continued on for 10 more minutes and Hiruzen had enough. He slammed his hand down on the desk, causing everyone to shut up and look at the man who survived in all three shinobi wars.</p><p>"Enough! I'm sick and tired of you civilians demanding the death of an innocent child, and demanding the arrest of my son and the death of Kenta! I have put up with you and you're whining and it's pissing me off!" He roared while releasing killer intent on the civilians and elders while the clan heads looked at him in shock, awe, and admiration.</p><p>This was the man who brought fear in the hearts of even the strongest ninja. In Tsume's head, a chibi version of herself was jumping up and down cheering for the Sandaime to kick their asses. The ANBU hidden in the corners couldn't believe how strong this man's KI was despite his appearance, the only unaffected was Ren because Kenta constantly K.I. barrage when they were training let him still standing and Kenta was yawning while looking at the cowered civilians and sweating ninjas in from of him</p><p>"Now I am going to say this once and one time only. My son you so much as touch him and I'm kick your asses before he himself do it! Same goes for Kenta! And Naruto is NOT the Kyuubi and never will be. It's soul is separated from his thanks to the seal my late successor created and cannot influence him unless you fools continue to attack him for no reason and Danzo you better keep your mouth shut about turning him into a weapon or I'll finish what I started by removing your other arm and eye!" He said seeing the war hawk about to speak but then shutted up when Sarutobi threatened to finish him off as did Koharu and Homura because they didn't want be executed.</p><p>"Ren will not be arrested and Kenta will not be killed nor sealed to make him a weapon, Naruto will not be killed nor will he be a weapon for us to create and throw away when we're done with him because I won't allow it. As long as I, Hiruzen Sarutobi wear this hat and hold the title of Hokage that boy WILL NOT be touched. If you fools think you can go behind my back and get away with harming him then you better be ready for your public execution. Now leave. I have more important things to do than hear you bitch and whine about things that don't concern you. This meeting is over."</p><p>He then got up to leave. "Wait Sarutobi you can't leave ye-" Homura started to say but was stopped when Sarutobi turned his head and gave him a look that could scare the Shinigami. "I'm sorry Homura but I didn't quite hear you. What did you say?" He said in a tone that meant death if the fool din't respond in the next second. "N-nothing Hokage-sama." The elder replied, fearing for his life.</p><p>"That's what I thought." He said as he left with the four ANBU following him and with Ren and Kenta by his side. The clan heads minus Fugaku only had one thing on their mind.</p><p><i>'</i><i>He's Bac</i><i>k'. </i>They thought as they all left out of the meeting room.</p><p>-<b>Outside the Council Room-</b></p><p>"I would like to thank you all for protecting Naruto earlier." Sarutobi said as they made their way to the Hokage office..</p><p><b>"Wouldn't need to if you could do it yourself old timer." </b>Kenta growled, still a little upset about what he saw and hear early this day.</p><p>"That's enough Kenta," Ren said as he put a hand on Kenta's big shoulder and addressed the Hokage "although he does have a good point Dad. And I think I speak for everyone here when I say that there's not a chance in hell that we're going to leave Naruto here, because I'm going to adopt him." At that the blond boy and old village leader snapped their heads to look at Ren.</p><p>"Really y-y-you meant it" Said Naruto with a storm of emotion in his eyes.</p><p>"C'mon give your two brothers a hug Runt" Replied Kenta with his arms open for the blue eyed child.</p><p>Naruto lunged forward and slammed in to the chest of Kenta and hug him for all he was worth it. As Ren too begin hugging the blond assuring him that they were going to be a family and never leave him as Naruto start crying over and over again saying "I have a Family now".</p><p>Sarutobi has a warm smile on his face seeing the new Family making a bond with each other.</p><p>As Ren finished the hug, he turned around to give his Dad another proposal.</p><p>"Dad, can I ask you a little favor." Asked Ren with seriousness in his voice.</p><p>"What's in your mind son?" Sarutobi replied, also with seriousness in his aged and tired voice as he saw the look and voice his son has on his young face.</p><p>"Simple, we take the boy with us back to the realm of Makai that I and Kenta trained myself in." Ren said in all seriousness, pleading that his Father woud let him and Kenta train the kid.</p><p>"Will I ever come back to the village?" Naruto asked looking back and forth between Ren and the Leader of Konoha.</p><p><b>"Only if you want to kid," </b>Kenta growled out <b>"but I'm not sure why you would want to though."</b></p><p>"I want to come back to prove to everyone that I'm not a monster and that they'll finally have to acknowledge me for me and not the Kyubi I've got locked up inside me." Naruto stated with a determined look in his eyes. Sarutobi's eyes widened when he heard Naruto mention the fox.</p><p>"You, you know about it Naruto?" Sarutobi asked frightened wondering if the Fox could influence Naruto.</p><p>"I knew about <i>him</i> for about two years now Old man, <i>he </i>helped me train a little in the shinobi arts, how do you think I could outrun those Anbu ne?" Said Naruto, not liking the Hokage refer to Kyubi as an <i>it</i>.</p><p>Sarutobi eyes widened when he hear all of that, Ren and Kenta din't bate an eyelash when Naruto mentioned the fox, they knew about the fox and din't think that he attacked the village just for shit and giggles, seeing the reaction of his son and Kenta at this information, puzzle him, but he put this at the back of his mind to question Ren and Kenta when they get back from the training trip.</p><p>Naruto seeing the face of confusion on the Hokage, replied to at least make him see that he wasn't an idiot like those villagers made him to be.</p><p>"Come on Old man, I'm not as stupid I let those villagers believe me to be. How could an idiot do so many pranks without Anbu being able to catch me once?" Naruto asked getting chuckles from Kenta and Ren, they'd seen some of the boy's pranks thanks to the memory transfer. "Attacking me on the day of the Kyuubi's attack, calling me monster and demon, hell I even heard some of them talking about a fox hunt!. It's not that hard to figure it all out Old Man." Everyone was starring at Naruto surprised before Ren started to chuckle.</p><p>"The young one reminds me of you Kenta." Ren said with a smile. The demon looking lion only gave Ren a smirk in response.</p><p><b>"Part me and part Ren that is a scary combination." </b>Kenta said with a chuckle.</p><p>"Well then it's decided, Naruto will come with us and train for a few years before we bring him back here to become a ninja, if that's what he still wants after all this time." Ren said looking at Naruto, as he was bouncing up and down.</p><p><b>"How's that sound to you, kid?" </b>Kenta said.<b> "Want to hang around with a </b><b>Hanyo</b><b> and a Demon and learn how to use your jinchuriki powers and jutsus?" </b>Naruto smiled and nodded vigorously.</p><p>"Well since Naruto agrees I won't argue, but I trusting you with the boy's safety and ninja training Ren, Kenta." he said looking at his son and Kenta, who gave a stern nod. "Have him back in 6 years for his final year at the Academy. Do we have an agreement?" Getting nods from them and Naruto the old Kage continued, "Good now I just need one of you to sign some papers releasing the boy into your custody and adopting him." he finished with a small smile, for once he was looking forward to doing that bit of paperwork. It would ensure Naruto's safety and growth over the next few years, and it would royally piss off those bastards in the council.</p><p><b>"All right," </b>Kenta said. <b>"Ren, you go ahead and help Naruto with any packing. Go to the middle of the Forest outside the village when you're ready to go. I'll handle the paperwork. I want us out of here before anymore of the villagers get any bright ideas about keeping the kid here." </b>Kenta ordered as he began walking in the Hokage office to sign the paperwork for Naruto</p><p>"Well c'mon Naruto let go" Said Ren while taking the hand of Naruto and shunshined <b>(Body Flickered)</b> to the apartment.</p><p><b>-Hokage Office-</b></p><p>Is Kenta was afraid of things, he was afraid now, let me ask you something, was is more scary than Kunoichi perverts <b>(Anko Mitarashi)</b><b>, </b>PMSing Kunoichis <b>(Tsunade), </b>or Kunoichi pervert haters <b>(Kurenai)</b><b>, </b>well the answer is a ninja Father who is very protective of their child, not to mention the fucking Hokage of the boy your want to court with, yep, Kenta was scare shitless right now.</p><p>"Am I clear" Said a demonic looking Hokage as he was seated in his chair, his hands entwined in front of his face as he looked at Kenta while the Shinigami was hovering behind him reaching with a pale bony hand toward Kenta's soul.</p><p><b>"Crystal clear Hokage-sama" </b>Said a very pale Kenta wondering if he was going to die today.</p><p>The killer intent and shinigami disappeared and back was the warm smile of the Hokage.</p><p>"Good now go, I think I'm hearing a Mob outside of the tower" Said the Hokage as he indeed hear people outside the tower.</p><p><b>"H-h-hai Hokage-sama!" </b>Said Kenta before bolting out of the room, thanking all that is holy that he is alive.</p><p>Sarutobi chuckles before looking out to the village and thought to himself as he held his pipe, <i>'Naruto-kun. I am sure that you will be a great ninja one day. Kushina and Minato would be proud of you' </i>He thought as he looked over at the picture of his late successor.</p><p>If only he knew how right he was.</p><p>He then turned back to his desk to battle a kage's ultimate enemy…paperwork. A vein appeared on his forehead as he glared at the paperwork. "I'm starting to think that Minato died to get away from this abomination and worse he didn't even tell me the secret on how to beat it." He whined as anime tears fell from his face.</p><p>The Anbu hidden in the office sweat dropped at how there Kage was acting.</p><p><b>-Forest of Fire country-</b></p><p>The next two hours passed quickly for Naruto. He and Ren had left the Hokage's office and made their way to his apartment. The 9 year old Naruto had had to stop Ren from going on a murderous rampage after he'd seen the abysmal state of Naruto's apartment. After quickly grabbing the few personal items that Naruto wanted to bring with him. Ren had refused to take any of the horrendous "target practice orange" jumpsuits with them, stating that they would buy him some new clothes as soon as they got back to were they would train him. Naruto didn't mind, he liked the color orange, sure, but even he knew that kind of clothing was just another civilian attempt to get him killed. After finishing they stepped outside and got onto the roof of the building. Ren sunshined to the village gate and shunshined again to the middle of the forest to see a slightly paler Kenta muttering about demonic looking hokages.</p><p>Ren just raised an eyebrow before speaking "We are ready Kenta"</p><p>Kenta turned is head to look at them and replied <b>"Well them, let go"</b></p><p>Ren nodded, and started making handseals <b>"Akumagan: Sunpou Kado no jutsu" (Demon</b><b>ic</b><b> style: Dimension Gate) </b>A black gate appeared in from of them, the gate looked like it was made from the very darkness of the night.</p><p>"Well let's go guys." Ren said with a smile as he looked at Kenta and Naruto</p><p>They walked to the gate, as they entered Ren turned back to the closing gate</p><p>The only thought Ren have before the gate closed was <i>'Watch out </i><i>K</i><i>onoha, because Naruto will be the "Lion Prince" when we come back'</i></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>XXxxXX</b></p><p>Ryu: Well that all for today, comments if you want to see more chapters please! Also my Oc only will be in this and the second chapter, after that I will focus entirely on Naruto, so don't worry okay?</p><p>Ren: Yes please, we greatly thank you if you do.</p><p>Kenta: <b>Whatever in the next chapter we will see Naruto's return to Konoha and maybe the genin exam...if Ryu isn't such a lazy bitch</b></p><p>Ryu: Oi! I'm not lazy!</p><p>...</p><p>Ren & Kenta: I can't believe what part of that statement you find offensive.</p><p>Ryu: Whatever til next time people!</p><p>All: Ja Ne!</p>

In the dimension they were training, Naruto noticed that Ren din't age like he was. Ren mentioned to Naruto that, he being a Hanyo, you stop ageing at the age of 18 or 20 so even if he look like 18, he could very well be 1000 years old. He now wears clothes similar to his brothers Ren and Kenta: a black sleeveless shirt, midnight blue pants with pockets, for scrolls if needed, black shinobi sandals, and finally a GAKU-RAN like Kenta over his shoulders only this was Black outside and Orange inside, On the front was the kanji for Lion Prince and on the back was the kanji for "Prince of The Beast" stitched in the back and the Uzumaki swirl with a roaring lion wrapped around it.</p><p>He's also wearing a pair of dark blue fingerless gloves with the leaf symbol on them. He has his sword "Tensa Zangetsu" <b>(Heavenly Chain Moon Cutter)</b> his brother gave him strapped to his back at an angle for easy reach since he was only 5'6". Along with his kunai pouch strapped to his right thigh and shuriken pouch on his left.</p><p>His GAKU-RAN also hid the blood seals that he had on his arms from view. There were eight in total. Four were for the sealing books that he got from his brothers, two were the family tai and kenjutsu and another seal held a scroll with all the: Fire Water, Wind, Ice, <b>(The fire being thanks to the Kyubi or Kurama as he learned the fox's name when they bonded, the wind being his father side, and water from his mother side and thanks to Ren and Kenta training combining the two making ice)</b> jutsu he learned or is learning and the last one held something precious to him.</p><p>It was a picture of his Family. Naruto was between Ren and Kenta, Kurama's arm around his hip while standing on a cliff smiling into the camera with the water from the ocean shining in the sunlight.</p><p>Beside him there was a red spiky haired man, he stood about 6'5. His clothes were a black muscle shirt, under a black leather jacket with a nine tailed fox stitched in the back, black shinobi pants with many pockets, black steel toed boots. He is also wearing a pair of dark red almost black fingerless metallic gloves with the Kanji for Nine on them. He also had a sword, "Kitsune Kokoro" <b>(Kitsune's Heart)</b>, it was a great masterpiece, it was two-edged and strapped to his back sideways for easy reach since he liked to use it in a reverse grip, since he liked to combine Taijutsu with Kenjutsu, making some sort of TaiKen style of fighting. <b>(AN:Think of Tatsumaru from Tenchui 2 style of fighting and how he had his katana at his back. Love him so much)</b> Naruto was so far learning how to add this style of fighting with his own style of fighting, also having Kurama to help him in this was just icing in the cake The only think that was strange about him was the black fox ears with black tips in his head and a fox tail with a black tip that was waving side to side lazily.</p><p>Now they were making their way to the Tower to report to the Hokage about how Naruto improved over these 6 years of Training. Ignoring the hateful look and confusion the villager and some shinobi was giving Naruto and specially Kenta because of his appearance and Kurama because they didn't know him yet, Kenta and Kurama were growling but a hand on their shoulders and with a shook of his head from Ren and Naruto stopped Kenta and Kurama before they kill the fools, the two then smiled and nodded has they entered the Tower.</p><p><b>-Hokage office-</b></p><p>The Hokage was sitting in his office, fighting his mortal enemy, the bane of all kages and leaders, that indescribable evil whose very name makes grown men weep: <i>paperwork. </i>He was glaring daggers at the mountain of papers that was in his desk wishing for it to combust or someone to come to his office so that he could be saved from this…this…<i>monster.</i></p><p>It looks like his wish was granted as four figures that he recognize as his son Ren, his hopeful son-in-law Kenta, an Uzumaki if the red spiky hair was anything to go by and…Minato!</p><p>"Minato…" Said the Hokage, with his jaws dropped and eyes as big as saucer.</p><p>'Minato' chuckled before giving his identity to the old man who was about to have an heart attack.</p><p>"No, old man it's me Naruto don't tell me that you forget about me" Said Naruto giving his Trademark fox grin.</p><p>"Naruto…"Said the Hokage before he stood up and gives his grandson in all but blood a crushing hug" Naruto my boy! Look at you…you are all grown up now" Say the Hokage with pride in his voice.</p><p><b>"That good and all old timer…but maybe can you, I don't know, give our brother some air please" </b>Said Kenta with amusing in his voice.</p><p>Sarutobi seeing the blue face of Naruto immediately finish the hug and sit down on his chair.</p><p>"I *pant* think my *gasp* life flashed trough me eyes just now" Said an out of breath and a little paled Naruto.</p><p>Ren chuckle before saying "Well dad, we are finally here and I believe Naruto going to enter the genin exam now huh?"</p><p>Sarutobi laughed before responding his son question "Yeah I believe so… but can you tell me who is the red-head standing behind you?"</p><p>Kurama looked at the Hokage in the eyes, his red slitted ones shining in the morning sunlight, the Hokage feeling eyes on him, looked at Kurama, and after some seconds, paled like he saw a ghost.</p><p>"Ky-ky-kyu-kyubi!?" Sarutobi screamed but thanks to the silence seal Ren did before he screamed, there were no army of Anbu suddenly crashing on the doors so they were saved.</p><p>Kurama just gave the God of Shinobi an amused look and waved from were he stood.</p><p><b>"Hey there you Old Monkey, is good to meet you..."</b> But judging by his voice, he was nervous as all hell meeting Sarutobi for the first time in the real world</p><p>Naruto took charge before the shit hit the fan.</p><p>"Woah Old man, relax he is no threat to us, or to the village anymore, so you can relax please?" Here Naruto unleashed his greatest weapon that had even the Kyubi submit to him, a pout and puppy dog eyes of doom.</p><p>Sarutobi's eyes twitched as he tried with all his might to not succumb to the greatest technique, but after sometime he sighed and Naruto pumped his fist in the air.</p><p>Puppy eyes of doom and pout: 1</p><p>God of Shinobi: 0</p><p>"Can you at least explain to me what is the Kyu- "Kurama" "-What?"</p><p>"Kurama...his name is Kurama, Kyubi is just a tittle" Said Naruto with a -Call him by his real name or else- look</p><p>Sarutobi sweatdropped and just nodded, afraid at the protectiveness Naruto showed here.</p><p>"Right Kurama, what in Kami's name is he doing here? Explain yourself" Sarutobi asked in his -I am the God of Shinobi, foolish mortal, answer now of feel my wrath- voice</p><p>Ren here just chuckled as he feel the K.I. enveloping the room, not wanting to delay his father, he quickly said. "Can at least Naruto and Kurama go to the Academy? Naruto need to take the exam and Kurama will not leave his side so he must take the exam too"</p><p>"Right well, I believe you two should head to the Academy to introduce yourselves. The first class of the year will start anytime now" He then went behind his desk and wrote a quick note before stamping it with his seal. "Here, head to the classroom on the note and give this to a man named Iruka, he'll be the man with a large scar across his nose. He'll be your instructor along with another man named Mizuki."</p><p>"If you say so Gramps, so where is the place?" Naruto asked, taking the note. The Hokage pointed out a building, and with a salute to the village leader, Naruto disappeared in a puff of smoke and Kurama in a red puff of smoke, while Ren and Kenta stayed in the office.</p><p><i>'You've certainly changed Naruto.'</i> The Hokage thought with a small grin. <i>'And I can't wait to see the kind of legend you become.'</i></p><p>"So why is the Kyu-Kurama out of the seal and in the real world?" He asked in his -Fear me, I am the Professor, answer my question or die- voice</p><p>Ren and Kenta just sweatdropped and proceeded to tell the Third Hokage what happened in those 6 years they were away.</p><p>-Shinobi Academy-</p><p>Iruka Umino looked over at the small sea of faces which was his class of students. They were all about fifteen years old, a little less than a decade younger than the chuunin himself, and all in their final year at the academy. They were also an, overall, arrogant bunch, most so assured that they'd pass the final exam in six months to become fully ranked genin. Iruka couldn't help but sigh at the thought that over two-thirds of his three dozen students would either be coming back next year or dropping out of the program entirely, but that was how the system worked.</p><p>This year the passes were pretty obvious, and more than a few were a little surprising. There were several clan heirs to some of Konoha's most powerful clans, plus a couple of prodigies, and even a few unusual cases that just might surprise him.</p><p>First there was Kiba Inuzuka, the youngest heir to the Inuzuka Clan, though his elder sister currently held the title of clan heir, Kiba constantly made claims that he would take that title for himself. He was a physically fit young man standing at about 5'7" and showing a good bit of muscle. He had spiky, dark brown hair, the standard Inuzuka fang-like markings on each cheek, and small, narrow, slit-like eyes. He was dressed in dark grayish-brown pants reaching to his calves and a grey, hooded fur-lined coat, with the hood usually placed on his head, and blue shinobi sandals. The boy was strong for his age, but was also extremely impulsive and reckless, something that would have to be evened out if he ever wanted to take his sister's place as clan heir.</p><p>Nearby soot the ever-stoic Shino Aburame, current heir to the Aburame Clan of insect handlers. The boy was the tallest child in his class, standing at a good 5'9" with pale skin and bushy brown hair. Most of the boy's body was concealed by the heavy sea-green jacket with a high, upturned collar that concealed most of his face and his dark sunglasses, along with his deep blue pants and shinobi sandals. Like most of the Aburame Clan the boy was calm and calculative, almost insect-like in most perspectives, and was quite solitary in nature, though it probably not by choice, since most considered the boy a bit creepy.</p><p>Then there was Shikamaru Nara, the heir to the Nara Clan, Konoha's famous clan of shadow manipulators. The boy was a typical Nara in nearly every aspect: lazy, uninterested and incredibly bright. The boy was one of the lower ranked members of the class, though this was mostly due to a lack of effort and the fact that he tended to sleep through most of his exams. He was a tall and lanky young man standing about 5'7" with black hair, usually tied up in a spiky ponytail similar to Iruka's own and narrow brown eyes. He was dressed in a green-lined mesh shirt, a short-sleeved, gray jacket with the Nara symbol placed on both sleeves and on the back, brown pants, and blue shinobi sandals. As usual the Nara's head was rested in his arms, apparently napping before class starts</p><p>Sitting next to the lazy Nara was his stalwart companion and best friend Chouji Akimichi. The young heir to the Akimichi clan was built just like the rest of his family: large. The young man stood a little taller than his friend at a respectable 5'8" with a very robust, some would say pudgy or fat, body. He had brown hair worn up in a slightly spiky fashion, a pair of red swirl-like markings on his cheeks, and small dark eyes. He wore a white shirt with his clan symbol on it, a short-sleeved green vest, gray shorts, and a long white scarf around his neck, and had bandages wrapped around the lower sections of his arms and legs. The large boy was a good kid and was loyal to a fault when it came to his friends. Right now, he was munching on a bag of potato chips, waiting for class to start.</p><p>Completing the traditional triad of InoShikaCho was young Ino Yamanaka. Ino was a very thin young lady, the results of the constant dieting a large number of Iruka's students seemed to favor, and stood a decent 5'4." She had long platinum blonde hair worn in a long ponytail that reached the small of her back while her bangs covering the right side of her face and pupilless, light blue eyes. She was dressed in rather revealing attire consisting of a short purple vest like shirt with a raised collar, a skirt that was cut off on the sides, purple and white elbow warmers, and bandage on her stomach and legs. She was a very attractive young lady, though the girl tended to be a bit controlling, read as bossy, and had some real talent as a kunoichi. Sadly that talent was often wasted as she was more interested in verbally sparing with her former best-friend and now rival Sakura Haruno.</p><p>Sakura herself was one of the few nonclan shinobi that Iruka actually though stood a good chance of passing the main exams. She was quite thin, some could even say a little scrawny, and stood at about 5'3" in height. She had long pink hair that flowed down past her shoulders, light green eyes, fair skin, and an unusually large forehead. She wore a red qipao dress with white circular designs, tight dark green shorts, and dark green shinobi sandals. Sakura was probably the most intelligent girl in the class, highly intelligent with good analysis skill, but she had some major faults. Physically the girl was the weakest person in the class, and the girl had a very bad temper as well, which often overruled her usually intelligence and forced her to charge into fights she couldn't win. If the girl wanted to succeed as a kunoichi she'd definitely need to shore up. Like her rival, the girl was deeply infatuated with the one Sasuke Uchiha.</p><p>Said Uchiha was the last survivor of the prestigious Uchiha clan. The young Uchiha stood a respectable 5'6" and had dark black hair, pale skin, a handsome face, and dark onyx eyes. He was dressed in a blue, short-sleeved shirt with a raised collar and the Uchiha crest on the back, white arm warmers, and white shorts. The boy was a very gifted student, some would even say a prodigy, and held a great deal of promise as a shinobi. However the boy had some serious issues that constantly worried the young Chuunin Instructor. The boy was arrogant, thinking his name as an Uchiha made him better than those around him and extremely antisocial not interacting much with his fellow students. Most of the female students in the class, save two, were completely infatuated with the young Uchiha heir.</p><p>One of the two young kunoichi-in-training was a young girl by the name of Tenten. The young girl stood at about 5'4" or 5'5" and unlike most of the other girls, who were obsessed with dieting had a fair bit of muscle on her body. She had lightly tanned skin, light brown eyes, and dark brown hair worn up in a matching pair of buns. She wore a pink sleeveless blouse and dark green pants along with matching green sandals. She was the daughter of the owner of a local weapons shop and was very skilled in manipulating and wielding the items her store produced. The girl was extremely strong-willed and devoted to proving that kunoichi could be just as strong as male shinobi.</p><p>The other girl was the young Hyuuga Heiress, Hyuuga Hinata. The girl was a mousy thing, standing at a slight 5'3". She had dark purple-blue hair worn in a short hime-cut, fair skin, and her white Byakugan were tinged with a light shade of lavender. She wore a cream colored hooded-jacket with a fire symbol on the upper right and left sleeves and fur around the cuffs and hem, with navy blue pants. She was a very timid and soft-spoken girl, and always seemed a bit depressed since about five or six years ago.</p><p>Sitting nearby was the girl's cousin, Hyuuga Neji. Unlike his cousin, Neji was a proud; some would say arrogant, young man who stood a good 5'8". The boy had dark brown hair, worn long down his back with a dark headband with two straps framing his face holding it back, light skin, and normal white Byakugan. He wore a khaki shirt, dark brown shorts, and had bandages wrapped around his right arm, chest, and right leg. The boy was a very skilled student and a prodigy at his clan's arts and techniques, but was also extremely antisocial. He seemed to bear a grudge against his cousin for some reason.</p><p>The final member of Iruka's picks was another nonclan shinobi by the name of Rock Lee. A year ago Iruka wouldn't have considered the boy an option, but ever since he was taken under the wing of Maito Gai, one of Konoha's top jounin, the boy was showing some amazing progress. He was a tall boy, standing about 5'9" and had dark black hair worn in a bowl cut, large eyebrows, and big, perfectly round, black eyes. The boy had taken to mimicking his mentor's attire, wearing a green jumpsuit and orange leg warmers. The boy suffered from a condition that left him unable to use most ninjutsu and genjutsu, which severely limited his abilities, but under Gai's tutelage the boy was quickly becoming something to be feared in the field of taijutsu. Personality wise the boy was a bit overly friendly and extremely energetic, and tended to overreact at times.</p><p>Overall Iruka though they had a good batch of future shinobi this year. Granted a few, okay most, of them had a few quirks and faults, but hopefully their senseis could help work them through it. Iruka was just about to call the class to attention when a small cloud of red, white smokes appeared in the room. Iruka tensed slightly until the smoke cleared to revile a young man no older than any of his other students and an older young man of 18 or maybe 19 years old.</p><p>"You Iruka?" the boy asked. Iruka nodded and the boy nad man gave a great sigh of reliefs. "Finally! It took me nearly half a dozen tries before I finally found the right room. My friend and brothers says that my flair for the dramatic is going to get me killed some day, but what can I say; I am who I am."</p><p><b>"We are only telling the truth Naruto" </b>Said the man.</p><p>"Oh shut up Kurama" Said the boy with a glare.</p><p>"Um, can I help you young man?" Iruka asked raising his eyebrow.</p><p>"Huh? Oh yeah," Naruto said before pulling out the note the Hokage had given him. "The Hokage wanted me to give you this." Iruka took the note and scanned it before nodding.</p><p>"Attention class, we have new students who will be joining us this year." Iruka called before turning to Naruto, and Kurama. "Would you like to introduce yourselves?" Naruto shrugged, and Kurama yawned and turned to they're new class mates.</p><p>"How are you all doing?" Naruto said with a smile. "The name's Naruto Uzumaki-Izamu, and yes, before anyone asks, I do mean Ren Izamu as the surrogate son of the Hokage. He's my adoptive brother. My likes are Felines but mostly big cats like tigers, lions, panthers, etc, Foxes, my precious friends, protecting say friends, my brothers Ren Izamu and Kenta, Kurama, the Hokage, Ramen, training, kenjutsu, taijutsu and fuuinjutsu, my dislike are perverts, rapist, pedophiles (coughorochimarucought) Fan girls, people who talk about fate, emo guys with a 4 foot poles shoved up there asses, arrogant people, traitors, people who don't know the different of a kunai and the scroll that contain them, and people who only like powers not caring who they must kill to get it. My hobbies are training my jutsus, my fuuinjutsu, taijutsu style and techniques, kenjutsu style and techniques and gardening, and my dream is to protect my precious friends, live a happy life with my brother's and have a mate and live a happy life with my mate too. I hope we can all get along." The reactions of the students were thus:</p><p><i>'He doesn't look so tough; I could take him no problem.' </i>Kiba thought.</p><p><i>'He certainly seems like an interesting new piece on the table.' </i>Shino thought examining Naruto.</p><p>'<i>Great another troublesome blond.' </i>Shikamaru thought lazily.</p><p><i>'Looks like an interesting guy.' </i>Chōji assumed.</p><p><i>'He's pretty cute but not as cute as Sasuke.' </i>Ino thought.</p><p><i>'He's nothing compared to Sasuke.' </i>Sakura thought, unknowingly agreeing with her rival.</p><p><i>'He may be the Hokage's adoptive grandson, but he doesn't look like much.' </i>Sasuke thought.</p><p><i>'I wonder if he can actually use that sword strapped to his back.' </i>Tenten thought curiously.</p><p><i>'He lo-looks nice and k-kind of familiar.'</i> thought Hinata as she tried to recognize the blond</p><p><i>'Though he holds ties with Hokage son, he cannot change his fate.' </i>thought Neji.</p><p><i>'He should make quite the youthful rival and friend.' </i>hoped Lee.</p><p><b>"Hello" </b>The students jumped when they hear his voice and Kurama smirked before saying<b>." The name's K</b><b>urama</b><b> and my likes are dango, red bean soup, meat, fight, training, a certain someone." </b>Naruto blushed tough nobody saw it, except Kurama.<b>"Interrogation, torturing captives, my </b><b>Tanto </b><b>Kitsune's Kokoro</b><b> (Man's Soul), and other likes, dislikes, are the same as Naruto.
