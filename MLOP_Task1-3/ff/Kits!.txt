 Okay, this story really liked throwing me for a loop, so I hope I
did a good job of writing it. It's actually a pretty good story in
my opinion. It combines a lot of the elements from lesser known but
really good stories I have found, and I hope I did good combining
them.</p><P><B>Kits</B></p><P><B><U>Pairings:</U></B>
 I haven't fully decided yet, whether this is going to be a
sasunarugaa, or what, but when I do, you'll know. Till then, It'll
probably center on kyuunaru, and sasunaru. Gaara WILL be in this
fic, so watch for it...</p><P><B><U>Warnings:</U></B>
 Violence (obviously...), rape,Yaoi, and Yuri if i can get away with
it. sakura bashing (seriously the little bitch needs to just die.
-Otaku), new village-ness (later on in the story), and probably a
touch of super!Naruto, but I tried not to do that. So now you know...</p><P><B><U>Description:</U></B>
 After a brutal rape at the hands of a gang, Naruto finds himself
pregnant. With</p><P>Sasuke
and Kyuubi in tow, he runs, knowing that Konohagakure is unsafe for
his unborn child.</p><P>Will
he find love? Or death, for him and those he cares about at the end
of the road?</p><P><B><U>Disclaimer:</U></B>
 If I owned Naruto, Sasuke wouldn't be KILLING Naruto at the valley
of the end, he'd be humping him. (kinda blunt, but true...-Otaku)</p><P><B>Kits
Chapter One - I Linger in the Doorway...</B></p><P><I>(Naruto:
Twelve</I></p><P><I>Sasuke:
Thirteen (one week past his b-day)</I></p><P><I>Kyuubi:
unknown</I></p><P><I>Pregnancy:
 Two weeks along.)</I></p><P>Naruto
wasn't a happy boy at all. Especially if you call being happy <I>not</I>
puking your brains out at three in the morning! And especially not
for the past WEEK! He was seriously going to kill Kyuubi, if this
turned out to be a cold, just for the fox's amusement.</p><P><B>No,
Little one, this is not my doing. I suggest you go to that human you
call a brother, and talk to him about it. He may have some idea of
what to do.</B></p><P>"Fox,
if I find out you had anything to do with this..." He left the
threat unfinished, and went to grab his coat. He was sure Sasuke
wouldn't be happy about being awakened at three in the morning, but
he really had no other alternative. The hospital wouldn't take him
unless it was an emergency, and even then they'd just patch him up so
that he'd survive, and then send him on his way.</p><P>And
with graduation being just two days ago, Naruto really couldn't
afford to be ill right now. Whatever it was must have hte potential
to be life threatening, if Kyuubi couldn't heal it instantly. (wow,
I've never heard anyone say a child could be life
threatening...-Otaku) Hopefully Sasuke would know what to do.</p><P>You
see, he and Sasuke had been friends for a very long time. Ever since
Sasuke had come up to him, after class one day a few months after the
Uchiha massacre, and looked at him.</p><P><I>flashback!!</I></p><P>"What
do you want, Sasuke?" Naruto asked, sounding resigned, but
keeping his plastic grin on.</p><P>"You
hide it. You smile, while I can't. You know what it's like to be
without family, without anyone</p><P>who
cares, and you hide it from everyone, rather than rage against it. 
Why?" Sasuke had a mildly pissed off look, which translated to
confusion, if you could speak Uchiha.</p><P>This
question caught Naruto off gaurd. No one had ever seen through his
mask. They all just assumed he was a trouble making Dobe, and let
him be. But <I>now</I> of all times, Sasuke was questioning his
mask.</p><P>"It's
just who I am." Naruto said, feigning misunderstanding. He
couldn't afford to let the Uchiha toy with him. He couldn't afford
for his mask to break.</p><P>"Don't
lie, Dobe! You and I are the same! I...How? How do you stand the
pain?" Sasuke said, looking close to tears. (remember, people,
This is just a few months after the massacre, sasuke is cold, but he
hasn't perfected his stoicness yet.)</p><P>"I
don't. I...I just train, until I can't think anymore because of the
exhaustion. And then I sleep, so that I can dream nightmares, and
wake up in the morning to start it all over again." Naruto
said, keeping his face emotionless. "That's what I do. If you
want, I can teach you how."</p><P>Sasuke
looked at him, and slowly, began to nod. So began their mutual
friendship, the bond between them growing so strong, that when Naruto
told Sasuke about Kyuubi, all he did was shrug, and say, "So
that's where you got the new Jutsus from."</p><P><I>End
flashback</I></p><P>As
Naruto flew threw the streets, running as fast as he could, a smile
touched his lips, a real one, as he thought of his best friend, his
ONLY friend, his brother in pain. Sasuke had been with him through
thick and thin since then, though they kept up the 'rivallry' in
public. Sasuke had provided him with a place to go to after the
beatings, though he had desprately wanted to stop them. Naruto had
told him no, that they would just say that he had bewitched the
Uchiha heir, giving them more ammo to use against him.</p><P>So
now, here he was, running through the abandoned Uchiha district,
trying to get to the mansion Sasuke had claimed as his. He reached
it pretty quickly, and knocked roughly on the door. Then he opened
it, stepping to the side, as the shuriken slammed into the ground
just behind where he had just stood, and slipped into the hallway. 
Silent, making no noise whatsoever, Naruto stalked down the main
hallway, deactivating any traps he couldn't slip past.</p><P>After
a bit, he made it to the kitchen, to find a VERY pissed off Uchiha
raven sitting at the table, with a bowl of instant ramen at the ready
and some tea for himself. He glowered at his best friend, taking in
his slightly unkempt apearance.</p><P>"Naruto,
don't tell me they snuck into your house again." Sasuke said,
voice betraying nothing, yet causing said blonde to flinch. That
voice, in that tone, begged him to defend himself <I>properly</I>
against the morons who hurt him. But he couldn't, becase that would
make it worse.</p><P>He
shook his head, taking his seat. "No, Sasuke, it's just
that...Well, you see, I've been ill just about every morning now for
the past week, and Kyuubi can't heal it, whatever it is, and I don't
know what to do." Naruto sighed, jumping into his ramen, like a
starved man onto steak. Sasuke watched his long time friend with
interest. He never could fathom how the boy could eat so much ramen,
yet never gain a fat-induced pound. The boy was all muscle. By any
means, he should be malnourished, but for some reason, he was fine.</p><P>"Naruto,
you should go to a doctor." Sasuke said. He had never talked
to Naruto about doctors before, so what Naruto said next surprised
him.</p><P>"He'd
just give me a placebo." Naruto said, brushing off the comment.
"No one wants to waste good meds on the 'demon'. So why bother?"</p><P>Sasuke
growled. He seriously hated these morons. Look what they did to
Naruto, who was probably (next to himself of course) the most
brilliant ninja in the village! Sure, he was a little ADD, but that
could be dealt with easily! Sasuke himself had figured out several
methods that made the kitsune-carrier pay attention VERY quickly. He
had no problem maintaining the 'Dobe's attentions either.</p><P>"Sasuke,
Kyuubi thinks it might be something to do with him..." Naruto
said, mouth pursed, looking perturbed about something.</p><P>"So
let him out, Dobe, and let him tell us." Sasuke said, scoffing. 
Naruto got bright again, bouncing around, as he performed the seals,
creating a Kage Bunshin. He waited, as Chakra infused the other
Naruto, turning it into an older-teens red-head. Said red-head
looked around, and stretched, his lean musculature showing off. His
crimson eyes turned to the boys, and he smiled the infamous 'Fox Grin
Ver. 2.0'. Both boys smiled back.</p><P>"Oi,
Kyuubi, what are you talking about?" Naruto asked, finishing
the last dregs of his ramen. Kyuubi looked over to the blonde, and
Sasuke caught the worried look on his face. However, he didn't have
time to do or say anything, because Kyuubi answered.</p><P>"You're
pregnant." Ramen sprayed all over the kitchen, the owner of
said kitchen, and one VERY amused fox-demon.</p><P>"You
gotta be shitting me!!" Naruto yelled, jumping up, looking
seriously pissed.</p><P>"No,
Naruto, I am not 'Shitting you' as you so eloquently put it." 
Kyuubi said, his rogue grin still very much attached to his face. 
"To put it bluntly, you are pregnant. With child. A bun in the
oven. Take your pick, I've got more."</p><P>Naruto
stared at him, horror coming onto his face. No. Not that night...
Anything but that.</p><P>Sasuke
looked between his two friends, and 'ahemed' to catch kyuubi's
attention.</p><P>"Kyuubi,
how is it possible for a male to be pregnant?" Kyuubi frowned
at the lack of honorific, but couldn't blame the kid. It was a
stressful situation.</p><P>"Well,
to put it simply, we fox demons don't particularly trust each other
usually, and so therefore, why would any male trust a female to bear
a litter of kits, and then hand one or two over to the father to
raise the child? So instead, the males of our species long ago
adjusted themselves, so that at certain times, a male could in fact
carry his OWN child, his own heir. All he needed was a partner to
provide the other half of the DNA, which was quite easy to come
across, seeing</p><P>as
we can seduce damn near anyone." Kyuubi was interuppted in his
rant however.</p><P>"I
didn't seduce ANYBODY!!" Naruto screamed, tears threatening to
fall. This wasn;t his fault! It couldn't be! He turned to Sasuke and
yelled it again, wanting Sasuke to understand. Sasuke looked on,
slightly surprised at the blonde's adamantness. This however made
Sasuke wonder, how <I>had</I> naruto gotten the other component, the
other DNA, and without his knowledge too, for Sasuke was sure the
blonde hadn't gone out and TRIED to get pregnant.</p><P>Then
it hit him. They'd finally done it. They'd taken it too far, and
now Naruto was pregnant.</p><P>"Who
was it, Naruto?" Sasuke said, his voice a violent calm, and his
blood-red sharingan shown anew. Naruto sniffled in response, and
shook his head, eyes adamantly on the floor. He refused, and Sasuke
swiftly crossed the room, and forced Naruto's face up to look him in
the eye. The fear in those sky-blue eyes drove Sasuke insane, he
wanted to end it, to end that pain and fear. But he needed to know
who.</p><P>"WHO,
Naruto?!" He asked, shaking the other boy a little.</p><P>"I-I
d-don't know. It was the middle of the night, and I was asleep, and
I didn't see. There were a lot of them..." Naruto's voice
broke, as he was thrown back into the memory of that night two weeks
before.</p><P><I>Flashback</I></p><P>Naruto
was awoken from a dead sleep, sitting up, as his window was forced
open. In swarmed a bunch of people. Their size made it easy to guess
most of their genders, though a few were questionable. They were all
men, and they were leering at him in the dark, but he couldn't tell
who they were.</p><P>Then
they were on him, and in cruel voices, they EXPLAINED what they were
doing to him, telling him all about who and what he was, a demon,
nothing more.</p><P>"And
why shouldn't a demon repay those who take care of him?!" One
screeched quietly, ripping off Naruto's pajama top. The others
tittered, laughing at Naruto's frightened whimpers and soft shouts of
'stop!'</p><P>"Hush
now, we're only taking our rent..." One of them said, smoothing
his hand over the blonde's inner thigh. Kyuubi growled violently in
the back of Naruto's mind, but Naruto clamped down on him. If he
changed, Kyuubi would kill these men, and then it'd get worse. Best
to give them what they want and let them leave.</p><P>He
screamed that night, as he was torn inside over and over. The men
had their fun with him, some his mouth, some his backside, others
still just cutting marks into his flesh. But all that would heal. 
Kyuubi would have most of it healed by the time he awoke the next
day. But worse still was the fear that settled over him, the fear
that those men would come back, and hurt him again. The fear that
others would see it on him and decide it was okay to do it again. 
The fear that even if he did tell someone, no one would care, no one
would even listen to him, or worse, accuse him of lying, accuse him
of being the monster he was.</p><P>It
took Kyuubi two days to suppress the mental damage enough that Naruto
wouldn't flinch around other men, including Sasuke. Naruto hadn't
wanted anyone to know, and so Kyuubi hadn't forced him to tell
Sasuke, but now...Now he had no choice.</p><P><I>end
flashback</I></p><P>"Naruto,
you...You should have told me! I could have helped! I could have
done...something!" Sasuke urged, quietly. He watched as the
kitsune moved closer, placing a hand on Naruto's shoulder. The
blonde flinched away, and sobbed quietly.</p><P>"You
couldn't do anything. Not without making it worse. They'd beat me
worse, gang up on me more, or worse, throw me from the village. I'd
be alone again, and you would too. There's nothing we can do about
it." Naruto said, his voice completely emotionless, as if
explaining something as stationary as history.</p><P>Kyuubi
felt the wave of anguish pushing against his own mind, as Naruto
prepared for Sasuke to leave, to blame him, something. He walked up
to Naruto and roughly slapped him.</p><P>"Now,
you listen here, kit. We both love you, and neither of us are going
to give up on you just because some group of perverts decided you
were their plaything! There is nothing in this world that would make
us abandon you, so you just get that thought out of your head right
now! Now we have to sit down and figure out what we're going to do,
becuase I, for damn sure, am NOT allowing you to carry that child
here, especially since, technically it's mine!"</p><P>Now
Sasuke raised an eyebrow at the demon, wondering what the fuck was
going on.</p><P>Kyuubi
shrugged, "My chakra changed the DNA of those bastards to match
what would have been mine when I was alive, so technically, this kid
is mine and Naruto's." The red-headed demonlord looked slightly
embarrassed at this.</p><P>Naruto
looked up at him, looking deep into crimson eyes, trying to find a
lie.</p><P>"So,
this is NOT their child? They can't take it away from me?" 
Naruto said, a small smile playing on his face, causing Sasuke and
Kyuubi both to smile with him. Sasuke stepped up and answered.</p><P>"No,
Naruto, this is yours. Your baby, your family, to raise and love and
care for." Sasuke folded the blonde into his arms again, and
sighed happily when Kyuubi pulled them both into his strong arms. 
Once there, Naruto's shaking slowly ceased, and he began thinking,
wondering, planning. Sasuke was thinking as well, deciding what
would be best for both him, and the dobe resting with him in the
shelter of Kyuubi's embrace.</p><P>"Naruto,
we should leave this village." Kyuubi said, voice deep,
rumbling in his chest. He looked down, as the two boys looked up at
him. "I could train both you and Sasuke, train you to be far
stronger than any of your pathetic teachers. I know a village that
will accept you, accept both of you, our kit, and myself all at once.
 Think about it. A place where you won't be hated, but revered, as
my host, my mate, even, if you chose it."</p><P>Naruto
looked up quickly, slamming his head into Sasuke's jaw. The raven
hissed in pain, but said nothing. The blonde was speechless. Had
Kyuubi offered to be Naruto's mate?! What was going on? Sure, Naruto
was carrying Kyuubi's child, but surely that meant little to the fox!
 Naruto turned cerulean eyes to Sasuke, who shrugged. It wasn't
really his business who the Dobe mated with, was it?</p><P>"This
village seems like a pretty decent place, Dobe, and who am I to turn
down a chance to be</p><P>trained
by the greatest demon to ever live. My only goal is to get stronger,
and that means I</p><P>need
power. Kyuubi is offering me that. I'll abandon this village to
take it, so it's up to you,</p><P>Dead
last. I kind of have to follow you anyway." Sasuke answered,
Uchiha smirk in place.</p><P>"But,
Konoha won't let me leave. The old man would be forced to hunt me
down..." Naruto</p><P>said,
face turned down in sorrow. Kyuubi lifted it quickly, forcing
sea-blue to meet fire-red.</p><P>"But
Konoha has no choice! They couldn't find this village if they tried! 
I told you, Naruto, long ago, that I would do damn near anything to
keep you alive! That includes happy, too, you dumbass, or did you
forget that! This is YOUR decision! No one can stop you if you want
to leave! I'll kill them if they try!" Kyuubi shouted, trying
to convince the boy. If only he would listen...</p><P>"...Alright.
I'll go, but what about you, Sasuke, aren't you worried about being a
Missing-Nin?</p><P>Wouldn't
that kind of ruin your whole 'ressurect the clan' thing you got
going?" Naruto turned</p><P>skeptical
eyes to the obsidian ones of his friend.</p><P>Sasuke
smirked, "Women find Avengers extremely sexy, dobe, in case you
haven't noticed.</p><P>And
anyway, if I have no luck there, I can always get you pregnant again
after this one."</p><P>Naruto
stood, gaping, as Kyuubi collapsed, his tails twitching in mirth. 
Sasuke jsut stood</p><P>there,
smirking, as if daring Naruto to do something about it. So Naruto
did, smirking himself.</p><P>"OH,
REALLY?!" Naruto said, jumping over the table, and proceeding
to tickle the living daylights</p><P>out
of his two best friends. This proceeded long into the day, and they
ended up collapsing on top of one another, taking a nap on the living
room floor. This was a sight of unimaginable warmth, one of family,
and one of peace. Peace that would soon be shattered, all because of
a simple choice...</p><P>End
Chapter </p><P>Otaku:
 WOW!! That took a long time to write! Much longer than most chapters
I write.</p><P>I
wonder how long it is...My word has been kicking my ass, so I wrote
this entirely</p><P>on
wordpad...Heh heh. I'm a genius at temparary solutions!!</p><P>Naruto:
 Yeah, yeah, we know! Now hurry up and write the next Chappie!</p><P>Otaku:
 hides behind Sasuke okay! okay! whispers jeeze, hormonal
much...?</p><P>Naruto:
I heard that!!</p><P>Sasuke:
 to Otaku You might wanna run...</p><P>Naruto
chases Otaku off set.</p><P>Kyuubi:
anyway, pay attention for the next chappie, people, it should be up
soon. She's obsessed with this story, so it'll be updated regularly,
hopefully!</p><P>Anyway,
have fun, and stay tuned for the next chapter!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
 Alrighty, here's the second chapter of Kits, this one is a little
crazy, but keep in mind, I tried</p><P>my
hardest to make it pretty realistic. I figure leaving a hidden
village isn't nearly as easy as a</p><P>normal
village would be. Anyway, have a good time with this chapter, I know
I did...</p><P><B>Kits</B></p><P><B>Pairings:</B>
 NaruKyuu, NaruSasu, probably NaruGaaSasuKyuu later on. I have a
thing for Gaara, okay?</p><P><B>Warnings:
 </B>Fuzzyheaded writer-ness, also, sakura-bashing, random flirting,
and a little bit of a cliché ending.</p><P><B>Description:
</B> Kyuubi leads Naruto out of the village, Sasuke with them, only
to have to flee rather quickly. It seems that leaving isn't nearly as
easy, when one has ANBU after you...</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B>
 You see me? You see me not rich? I no owny Naruto.</p><P><B>Kits
Chapter Two</B>- Of Alarm Clocks Screaming</p><P>Kyuubi
awoke them quite quickly however, when he suddenly disappeared,
leaving Sasuke to fall, unceremoniously onto Naruto's stomach. This
caused a loud "GERROF!" to sound in the avenger's living
room, as he was roughly shoved off of Naruto's stomach, and an
equally loud knock came on the door.</p><P>Sasuke,
groggy, but instantly awake, due to years of Ninja training, was
alert. He grabbed several of his kunai from behind the vases, one of
several hideaways in the mansion, and disabled his traps as he went. 
When he got to the door, he noticed an equally alert, equally
prepared Naruto behind him. He nodded silently to let the Dobe know
he knew he was there, and then went to the peephole.</p><P>It
was Sakura.</p><P>They
both breathed a sigh of relief; it was only their classmate, probably
there to get them for that whole Jounin teacher thing. Realizing
what day it was, Naruto went back to the kitchen, and, grabbing some
ramen, and a few of the pre-made Onigiri (Rice balls) from the
fridge, and quickly making up his and Sasuke's lunches, while Sakura
was greeted with a 'what are you doing here?'.</p><P>Naruto
slapped himself lightly on the face, preparing to put his mask back
on, and started grinning, right as Sakura and Sasuke appeared in the
doorway of the kitchen. Sakura looked shocked, and Naruto turned
around, grinning like always as he held out Sasuke's lunch.</p><P>"Naruto,"
Sakura started in a very dangerous tone, "One, what are you
doing here, in <I>Sasuke's house?</I> And two, did you make that
lunch!?"</p><P>Naruto
looked at Sasuke, looked at Sakura, and then burst out laughing. Not
quite at what most would think however. He was laughing because
Sakura was <I>still</I> getting jealous of him. He wasn't even the
one who hit on Sasuke first! It was Sasuke who started with the whole
"Get the dobe pregnant as a last resort!" thing!</p><P>Sakura
was fuming, and Sasuke had a slightly bigger smirk on his face. He
was waiting to see Naruto's answers to her questions.</p><P>"N-no,
Sakura! He made them, hee hee, all by him-himself. And I'm here,
cause I figur-ha ha ha! fig-figu-figured that you wouldn't want to
make two trips!!" Towards the end, it got a little high pitched
as Naruto lapsed back into a fit of giggles. Sakura looked at him
like he was insane.</p><P>"Well,
anyway, you missed the announcement of the teams. It's us three, and
we've got the rest of the afternoon off until three, when we meet our
Jounin teacher." Sakura said, eyeing the onigiri. Apparently,
she was hungry.</p><P>Sasuke
took the onigiri from his blonde teammate, and threw it to Sakura. 
Her green eyes shone with some strange light, as if she were about to
cry, as she hugged the onigiri to her. Naruto suddenly wanted to get
as far away from her as possible, lest that...gooiness get stuck on
him.</p><P>Sasuke
went back and got another set of Onigiri, and then they left for the
park. Naruto seemed a bit preoccupied, but Sasuke knew that was
probably just from talking to Kyuubi. Sakura on the other hand,
couldn't help but notice.</p><P>"Is
something wrong, Naruto? You seem...preoccupied." Sasuke almost
couldn't stop himself from slapping his own forehead. Way to state
the obvious, moron! Naruto blinked out of it, and grinned back at
Sakura.</p><P>"Huh?
Oh, no, just wondering what our teachers gonna be like." This
started Sakura on one of her rants, causing Sasuke to thank Naruto
silently, as now they could both tune her out. Naruto nodded a silent
'you're welcome' before the three of them sat down to eat a slow
lunch, Sakura blatantly hitting on Sasuke, Naruto blatantly hitting
one her (messing with her mind...), and Sasuke silently laughing at
both their antics.</p><P><B>Kit,
don't you think you should let Sakura know she's gonna be on a team
by herself soon?</B></p><P>'No,
fox, because if I do, she'll tell the hokage, and Sasuke and I'll be
put under observation. It'll make it harder to get gone.' Naruto
answered in thought, knowing the demon fox could hear him. He
mentally sighed, as his back ached increasingly. Random aches and
pains were something he increasingly expected with pregnancy, due to
the increasing amounts of them. He hissed a little, rubbing at his
shoulder. When Sasuke looked at him curiously, he shook his head
tensely.</p><P>Sakura,
brilliant dunce that she was, missed the entire exchange in favor of
glancing at the clock. It informed her that they were about to be
late. So of course, she wrangled her teammates into going back to
the classroom to finish their half-eaten lunches.</p><P>However,
they really shouldn't have bothered, seeing as they got Kakashi, who
was known for being at least two hours late to anything non-life
threatening. This caused Naruto, who over time had evolved into
Hormonal!Naruto, to play several really nasty pranks on him, with
Inner Sakura and Sasuke both silently cheering him on.</p><P>This
in turn, caused Kakashi to have the first impression of: "I
hate you."</p><P>After
that whole ordeal, they went through introductions on the roof.</p><P>All
three of the team members sweat dropped as Kakashi told them nothing
but his name. Then he told them to introduce themselves to him,
starting with the blonde. (This is the order it goes, right? Blonde
then Sasuke then pinky? -Otaku)</p><P>"Hi,
I'm Uzumaki Naruto, I'm thirteen, I like Ramen, I hate the three
minutes it takes for ramen to cook, ummm, I don't really have any
hobbies except pranks, and my goal is to protect those that I love."
 He couldn't help straying a hand to his abdomen, which Kakashi
noticed but didn't do anything to indicate he had, after all, the boy
was probably hungry.</p><P>Next
came Sasuke.</p><P>"My
name is Uchiha Sasuke. I'm fourteen as of two weeks ago, I don't
have any likes. I have many dislikes, and I don't have hobbies, I
train. My only goals are to recreate my clan, and to kill a certain
man."</p><P>"Alright,
Pinky, you're up!" Kakashi said, smiling his one-eyed smile.</p><P>"My
name is Haruno Sakura, I'm fourteen, What I like...Well, it's more
like a person...but...My dislikes? Naruto! My hobbies... well, a
little of this and a little of that..., and my goals? Well, ummm..."
 WAY too many stares in Sasuke's direction for his taste. He turned
his head away a little.</p><P>"Alright,
now that we're done with introductions, go home and get some rest. 
There's a mission tomorrow to decide if you stay Gennin, or if you
fail. Don't eat anything for breakfast; you'll just puke it up
again. Bye!" Kakashi said poofing out of there as quickly as he
could. He spent twenty minutes laughing.</p><P>He
had a hyperactive prankster, a love-sick puppy, and an angsty
avenger. This was going to be great! A wonderful time for his first
ever team of Gennin! He was gonna have soooo much fun torturing these
morons!</p><P>Meanwhile,
Sasuke got up, and with a silent glance, told Naruto to meet him at
his house later. They still needed to plan after all. Then he turned
to walk away. Sakura immediately started hitting on him, and Naruto
decided to help his friend out, so hit on the pink haired girl in
turn. Of course, she turned him down, but it gave Sasuke time to get
away.</p><P>After
that whole ordeal, all Naruto wanted was to go get some ramen. So he
did!</p><P>He
traveled the well known shortcut to Ichiraku's ramen stand, and was
soon sat down with a steaming bowl of the wonderful delight, swimming
with the fishy little crackers he shared a name with. He tucked in,
quickly finishing three full bowls, before he felt he was in the
clear to visit Sasuke once again. So he bid the old man and his
daughter goodbye, and set off for the Uchiha district. He ran
swiftly through it, sad to see the grandest district, aside from the
Hyuuga's of course, so silent and dark.</p><P>He
arrived at the Uchiha mansion soon enough, and knocked loudly on the
door, to let Sasuke know, wherever he was in the huge mansion, that
SOMEONE wanted in. He waited a good ten minutes, studying the
shrubbery (SHRUBBERY!!! been watching too much Monty python...-Otaku)
until the door opened, and he was ushered into the huge mansion by
his dear friend.</p><P>Sasuke
looked rather bored, to tell the truth, and quickly sat Naruto down
at the kitchen table, starting a pot of tea. He sat down and
immediately started in.</p><P>"Naruto,
for the remainder of our time here, you need to stop patting and
rubbing your stomach so much! I'm sure Kakashi noticed it, as will
any enemy we have. And as you know, I have a very</p><P>powerful
enemy!"</p><P>"I
know, Sasuke, I just can't help it though. It's still really
strange, thinking there's this little person</p><P>growing
in there." Naruto said, eyes wistful, as his hands strayed to
his abdomen again. Sasuke smiled a little. At least his friend was
taking his impending motherhood well. It, hopefully, would go
smoothly for the blonde.</p><P>"We
need to set down plans for our escape." Sasuke announced,
breaking the blonde out of his thoughts. The jinchurikii nodded, and
called out Kyuubi once again. The older-looking red-head glomped the
two, an incredible feat, since the two were on opposite ends of the
table.</p><P>"Alright!
I'm getting out, more and more!" Kyuubi whooped. He was
thoroughly happy, not only was he getting his very own kit, he was
able to escape the dreary prison every once in a while too!</p><P>"Keep
a lid on the chakra, Kyuu-chan, unless you want ANBU all over us."
 Sasuke said, in a bored tone. Kyuubi bristled at the -chan bit, but
otherwise, brought his chakra under control.</p><P>"Alright,
so, what do we need?" Sasuke, always the self-starter, prompted
the two.</p><P>"Well,
we're gonna need food, and supplies." Naruto said, thinking
hard.</p><P>"No,
we can get whatever we need from my compound. We still have a ton of
weapons and journey rations from before the slaughter. We can take
those tonight. Do you have anything you need to get from your
apartment, Naruto?"</p><P>"A
few things, some shuriken, a few scrolls, but other than that, not
much."</p><P>"Good,
than let's go get those, and then we can be out of this accursed
village as soon as dark falls!" Kyuubi agreed, pleased with
himself. Naruto and Sasuke got ready to go, while Kyuubi
disappeared, going back to his prison inside Naruto's seal.</p><P>They
slipped out the door, down the streets, and into Naruto's apartment
with trained ease. They</p><P>spent
a few moments gathering what Naruto would need, and then, Naruto
bidding a silent goodbye to the place that had sheltered him for a
very long while, they left, heading back to the compound. There, they
once again summoned Kyuubi and set about gathering the supplies
needed from this house and that.</p><P>Soon
it was dusk, and they sat impatiently in Sasuke's hallway, waiting
for the dark of night to fall</p><P>and
give them a bit of cover. That's what they really needed, if they
were to ever outrun the</p><P>ANBU
that were sure to be after them. They would need every bit of
cunning and trickery they had in the next few weeks, and they knew
it. It was part of the reason they were so anxious to</p><P>get
out. A new challenge, a new test of their skills. Were they strong
enough, or would they</p><P>find
themselves caught?</p><P>Finally
it was dark, and they started their trek to the wall. The village's
wall was of course, huge,</p><P>and
they would have to find someway to get over it, for the gates were
closed and wouldn't open</p><P>until
morning. They wouldn't be able to get out that way anyway, not
unless they had the hokage's permission.</p><P>They
got to the wall, and, flinging grappling hooks over quickly, they
scurried up, trying desperately to get up top before one of the
guards found their hooks. They were almost up, when one of the
guards yelled out. They had been caught! Naruto climbed faster, and
Sasuke tried to as well.</p><P>They
made it to the top, but the guard was coming too, and they had no
choice. Sasuke made a split second decision. He pushed Naruto
towards the side, while readying one of his best Jutsu's.</p><P>"RUN,
Naruto, I'll meet you in the dark water!" Sasuke yelled, shoving
his friend once more.</p><P>"But!"
Naruto tried to argue with him, but the Ninja were coming, and he had
no choice. "I will</p><P>find
you again, Sasuke, I won't give up, so don't you give up either!"
He yelled as he jumped</p><P>down,
using the rope as a guide. He landed and took off running, trying to
get as far away as</p><P>he
could.</p><P>Meanwhile,
Sasuke, as soon as Naruto had a few minutes head start, gave up and
requested to</p><P>see
the Hokage. Let's just say Sarutobi wasn't a very happy old man. 
Sasuke walked through</p><P>the
early morning town, head held high, and sure that he would see Naruto
again. After all,</p><P>Naruto
had promised, hadn't he?</p><P>End
Chapter </p><P>Otaku:
Wow, that one threw me for a loop! I didn't know that Sasuke was
going to get caught until</p><P>halfway
through the chapter!</p><P>Sasuke:
Oh, great, thanks!</p><P>Otaku:
 oh, don't bitch! You'll see Naruto again soon!</p><P>Sasuke:
 If he ever figures out anything...</p><P>Naruto:
Hey! I know what your clue means!</p><P>Sasuke:
Oh really? then what?</p><P>Naruto:
um...Um...</p><P>Sasuke:
 hah.</p><P>Naruto:
oh shut up, teme!</p><P>Sasuke:
Dobe.</p><P>Otaku:
you're both morons so shut up!!</p><P>Kyuubi:
alrighty then...well, stay tuned for the next exciting chapter of
Kits!</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
 Alrighty people, here's where things REALLY start to deviate from
the plot of Canon!Naruto, so from now on this is classified an AU. I
know it probably was already, but shut up, it's my fantasy dammit! 
Anywho, here's an chock-filled chapter, full of romance, adventure,
drama, and not a bit of drama-queen-ness. So, on with the
fantastical play!</p><P><B>Kits</B></p><P><B>Pairings:</B>
in this chapter, NaruKyuu, as well as slight KyuuSasu, and NaruSasu. 
Also, if I can work it in, a tiny bit of KakaIruka, too.</p><P><B>Warnings:
 </B></p><P><B>Description:</B>
 Sasuke is being throroughly grilled by Sarutobi, the Hokage, while
Naruto hightails it to their meeting point in the Land of Mist. Will
Sasuke be able to meet Naruto anytime soon?</p><P>It
looks extremely unlikely for our poor heroes...</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B>
 I don't own Naruto, becuase someone else does! That's called
stealing, and much as I love Dark, I'm not a theif... (HEY!! -Dark)</p><P><B>Kits
Chapter Three - Monsters Calling My Name</B></p><P>Sasuke
sat on the uncomfortable chair, glaring at the aged man before him. 
The hokage was a</p><P>stubborn
old fool, but Sasuke had the upper hand here. Sarutobi still
couldn't tell him WHY</p><P>they
wanted Naruto back, and Sasuke refused to talk without a reason. 
Sasuke smirked.</p><P>"You
haven't answered my questions, Hokage-sama. Why is it so bad that
Naruto wanted to</p><P>leave
the village? He doesn't know any village secrets, so he's not a
liability. I don't understand."</p><P>Sasuke
said, his voice calm and indifferent.</p><P>Sarutobi
was caught. He couldn't, by his own decree, tell Sasuke that the
reason they needed</p><P>Naruto
back was that they had to moniter him to make sure the seal never
broke. That the</p><P>reason
Naruto had to stay in the village that hated him, was to make sure
the demon that was</p><P>inside
him never attacked any one else.</p><P>The
hokage sighed, "Sasuke, just tell me which way he went. I'm
only sending out ANBU to</p><P>bring
him back, not to kill him, and he won't face any reprecussions when
he is safely back in</p><P>the
gates. You have nothing to fear on his behalf, so tell me where he
went."</p><P>Disbelief
showed clearly on Sasuke's face. Sarutobi sighed once more. He
swore that Sasuke</p><P>was
almost as bad as Orochimaru when it came to reading him. He frowned
a bit at the thought</p><P>of
his traitorous student, but shook it off. Best not to dwell on the
thought of misfortune, lest the</p><P>thought
bring it to you, after all.</p><P>Sasuke
was really biding his time. He figured if he could give Naruto half
a day's head start, the</p><P>dobe
could hide effectively, and mislead the ANBU who were sure to find is
trail sooner or later.</p><P>It
was the best help he could offer his friend now, and he hoped it
would be enough. Some how</p><P>he
had a feeling it wouldn't be, however.</p><P>"Fine
Sasuke, since you feel the need to keep your mouth silent, I'm forced
to have you monitered by ANBU from this day until I retract them."
Sasuke was about to argue, when the Hokage finished, "And you
will continue your studies, as if all were normal. No one need know
of this slip. I will be sending three teams of ANBU out to find
Uzumaki Naruto, and we <I>will</I> bring him back home, you need not
fear that, Sasuke."</p><P>And
Sasuke was dismissed, with three new 'birds' following him. Only
these birds were quite a bit</p><P>deadlier
than his normal variety of followers. He sighed. This would be
troublesome, as Shikamaru would put it.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Naruto
leaned heavily against the tree, breath heaving, as he rested for a
few moments from his long run. He still had two full days of running
if he was to get to Mists before the ANBU caught him. He'd never been
very good at cryptograms, but there wasn't much else Sasuke could
have meant by saying "I'll meet you at dark water."</p><P>Naruto's
legs collapsed on him. This was going to be troublesome...(COPYRIGHT
LAWS!! -Shikamaru) He called to Kyuubi, and found that the fox
responded much sooner than normal.</p><P><B>What
do you need, kit?</B></p><P>'Some
Chakra, fox, I'm gonna make a clone to carry me, and another to run
off for a few days. I can't run anymore until I rest for a good hour
or so.' He thought hurriedly, and sighed in relief as the blood-red
chakra ran through him. Quickly, before anything could go wrong, he
summoned the clones, overloading one on chakra, and sending it off in
a random direction. Then he ordered the other clone to carry him,
while heading in a sort of sideways way towards the Mist country.</p><P>This
continued until Naruto had slept fitfully for about four hours, then
he dispelled the kage bunshin with him, and landed running on his
own. He ran for as long as he could, every ten or twenty minutes,
creating another 'two day' clone to run off in a random direction,
sometimes back the way he came, to keep the ANBU off his scent. And
occasionally, he'd turn, and run north, or east or south for a while,
then create a shadow clone to continue running that way, while he ran
back on track. He hoped that this would be enough to confuse them,
even if just for a few hours.</p><P>And
it was. Dog, Rabbit, and Badger were severly pissed off. They had
been following Naruto's trail, and when it deviated, one of them
would go follow it. This was slowing them down, for days, however,
and they were tired of chasing the little brat! Their teams were
getting antsy at being outsmarted by a smart aleck, no good,
demonboy. They were running low on morale, and on top of that, they'd
still seen no definate signs of Uzumaki anywhere. It all seemed to
be clones!</p><P>For
three days and nights, Naruto ran, resting on the back of one of his
Bunshins when he needed to sleep, until he finally reached a large
expanse of water. There was a boatsman, but he didn't want anyone to
say they saw the blonde shinobi cross.</p><P>He
muttered, "Sexy no Jutsu" and suddenly, he had boobs. He
altered the amount of chakra in the jutsu, and he was no longer a
buxom, young, blonde bimbo, but rather, a cute young brunette. He
did a small amount of taijutsu, and when he was sure he could handle
expending the chakra over strenuous periods of time, he squared his
shoulders and was about to step out into the open.</p><P><B>Wait,
Naruto.</B></p><P>Kyuubi's
soft request stopped the newly female Naruto, and then he felt the
fox's chakra mingle with his, and found himself doing the seals for
Kage Bunshin. Then before him stood Kyuubi, in all his fire-haired,
crimson eyed glory. Along with the jutsu, Kyuubi had created for
himself, a simple brown and red work kimono, and a 'pack'. He looked
like a really handsome peasant boy, and Naruto looked like a very
cute peasant girl. Kyuubi grinned his fox grin, and the pretty blue
eyed brunette answered with one of her own.</p><P>"<B>I'm
Kitamura Kyuuto, and you are Kitamura Naru, we are newly weds, and
are looking for work in the village on the other side of the lake,
got it?"</B> "Naru" nodded, and then, as one, they
stepped out to face the oarsman.</p><P>"Oi,
what you be doing there?" He asked, accent near the point of
making him indecipherable. Naruto and Kyuubi paused for a moment,
obviously confused (uh-huh, RI-IGHT...-Otaku). Then Kyuubi, wonderful
actor that he was, took an 'unsure' look at his 'wife', and stepped
up to the boatside.</p><P>"We
were wondering if you would give us a ride to the otherside of the
river. We don't have much, but we're willing to pay." He said,
voice soft and velvety, but still sounding like that of a nineteen
year old human boy. The oarsman looked at him strangely, then eyed
Naruto. "Naru" made a show of shivvering in disgust, and
huddling closer to "Kyuuto".</p><P>Kyuubi
kept himself in check, he did not growl at the human, who had no
right to stare at Naruto as if he were meat to be devoured. He,
instead, dug through his 'pack', and came out with two rocks,
illusioned into looking like two Ryos. (That's the name of the money
in my world, so live with it...-Otaku) The oarsman saw the supposed
money and gap-toothed-grinned at them, taking the magicked rocks, and
holding out a hand to help the lady aboard. She took it, after a
hesitant glance at her 'husband', and soon they were being safely
rowed across the river.</p><P>During
the ride, however, they were forced to listen to the old man screech,
in what appeared to be song. It nearly deafened Naruto, and Kyuubi
had a ringing in his ears for days afterwards. As they swiftly
crossed the water, they noticed a dark shape looming out of the fog,
and Naruto didn't have to fake a gasp of awe, as a colassal bridge
appeared, only half finished, but still as grand as Hokage-mountain
itself.</p><P>"That's
the bridge that Tazuna's building. Says it's gonna help us get out
from under Gato's influence, bring help, he says. I don't think so. 
I think it's gonna get him killed, is what it's gonna do." the
oarsman said, sadness appearing on his wrinkled brow.</p><P>"Is
he looking for helpers? We need jobs, right dear?" "Naru"
said, cheerfully, as if not understanding the words the old man
spoke. The oarsman looked at 'her' incredulously, but when 'Kyuuto'
nods his head, looked at them both like they were utterly batty.</p><P>"If
you want death, well then, you can find his daughters house about
three miles west from where we'll land. It's situated in a pretty
decent sized forest. The daughter's name's Tsunami, and she's got a
son named Inari."</p><P>Kyuubi
quirked an eyebrow at this name. Some human dared to name their
child after the rice god? Perhaps they were trying to garner favor
from the ancient god. He wished to meet this whelp, see if he was
truly worthy of the prestigious name.</p><P>After
they landed, they bid a short farewell to the oarsman, and went on
their way, listening to the man's screeching voice long after he had
disapeared into the fog off the river. They turned west, and started
running, as fast as they could. They reached the house of Tsunami,
daughter of Tazuna the bridge-builder, in record time. After quick
scouting around to see just what they were getting themselves into,
checking the perimeter of the house and such, they settled down a
little ways away to discuss what their plan would be.</p><P>"I
think we should just ask if they need any work done around the house,
any help at all." Naruto suggested, Kyuubi nodding his
agreement.</p><P>"Alright,
but first, how long have we been married?" Kyuubi said, keeping
his voice low.</p><P>"Two
weeks, ever since we found out I was pregnant. How did we meet?"
 Naruto said, settling the details of their story into his mind.</p><P>This
is what they came up with.</p><P>They
had met at a festival, had a little too much wine, decided they loved
each other, and fucked. Then Naru turned up pregnant, and Kyuuto
decided to take care of her and the child. They had to elope becuase
their families didn't approve of the marriage, and Naru's threw her
out. They decided to come to Mist country from Rock country, so they
could start over without either of their families interfering.</p><P>Naruto
nodded in surety. " Alright, we have our story straight, now...
Let's go charm the pants off of 'em!" He grinned, and reached
for his 'Husbands' hand. Kyuubi linked their fingers and lead them
towards the front door of the house. They looked at each other,
nodded one final time, and Kyuubi knocked on the door.</p><P>They
didn't have to wait long for a response, as a young boy opened the
door, startling Naru into gasping. He was a mournful looking child,
with a mop of dark hair hidden under a bucket hat. He looked at them
with a scowl on his face.</p><P>"What
do <I>you</I> want?" He asked, snarky. Kyuubi was about to
growl at the brat, when 'Naru' held up a stilling hand. 'Kyuuto'
stopped and stood back, letting 'Naru' deal with the child. She
smiled softly at the boy, and he was taken aback.</p><P>"Little
one, we were told we could find Tsunami, the daughter of the
bridge-builder here. Do you mind if we speak with her?" He
asked, making it sound as if they were asking his permission. This
gave the child an ego-boost, and he looked at the warmly smiling girl
before him and the scowling red-head, and nodded, leading them
inside. The two took off their shoes,</p><P>respectfully,
and waited in the hall as the boy went to fetch Tsunami.</p><P>She
came into the hall drying her hands on a towel, and looked them over,
smiling quietly. Then she ushered them into the dining room, and had
them sit. After that, she brought tea in for them, and sat down.</p><P>"We
don't often get visitors this far from the village. May I ask your
business?" She said, tilting her head in curiousity. The two
certainly were a striking pair. She had never seen such brilliant
blue eyes on anyone, and that flame-red hair, it held her in awe. 
They were both extremely beautiful, and she wondered what they could
possibly want with her, seeing as they seemed</p><P>nobility.</p><P>"Actually,
my husband and I were seeking work. I, hopefully in your home,
helping out, and my husband with your father on the bridge. We heard
we might find work here, and so came as quickly as we could. I would
offer to help on the bridge, too, but" Here the brunette paused,
and smiled serenely, placing a hand on her abdomen, "I fear it
might harm the child."</p><P>Tsunami
gasped. This girl-child was pregnant! Dear lord, no wonder she was
married at such an age! This shocked Tsunami quite effectively. She
felt very protective of the girl child now, and scowled at the
red-headed boy. How dare he take her away from her family at a time
like this! It was unfair to the girl, and she intended to tell him
so.</p><P>"Sir,
I don't very well approve of this poor dear leaving her family at a
time like this! She should be surrounded by her mother and aunts
right now, not being towed all around the country!" Tsunami
hissed at Kyuubi, who blinked utterly taken aback. He decided to play
this game and act as any normal teenage boy would act. He got
miffed.</p><P>"Look,
Lady, I didn't take Naru-chan away from anyone! They kicked her out
becuase she was marrying me, and I couldn't very well stay with my
clan while Naru-chan froze to death out on the streets! So I took her
with me to search for someplace else to live. I don't see as it's
any of your business anyway." He said, staring her down. 
'Naru-chan' placed a soft hand on her 'husbands' haori sleeve, and
looked at him pleadingly. He huffed, but calmed down. 'Naru' turned
towards Tsunami.</p><P>"Tsunami-san,
please, don't be angry with him. It was truly my own fault. I fell
in love, and it led to this situation here." Kyuubi flinched
inside at the blatantness of the lie. It was quite the opposite that
had led the poor Jinchurikii here.</p><P>But
Tsunami bought it, and calmed. She looked the two over carefully,
and noticed the worry-filled looks the boy was throwing towards his
wife, and the sadness in her eyes. It melted her heart, and she was
more than willing to give the two jobs.</p><P>"But,
unfortunately, I don't have much money, and I do most of the
housework myself, but I could use someone to watch Inari. I'm afraid
he's been bullied, and recently lost his father, so he's a bit of a
handful, but if you're willing, Naru-chan, I can pay you in food, and
a bedroom for the two of you. I might be able to spare a few coins a
week, and I know my father will put your husband..." She seemed
to be waiting for something, and Kyuubi quickly supplied his
falsified name, "Kyuuto-san, right to work at the bridge. He
should make a little over twenty Ryos a day, that's what all the
other men make. Will that do?"</p><P>Naru-chan
nodded fervently, and smiled brilliantly up at Kyuuto, who smiled
softly down at his little wife. Kyuubi could get used to this act,
but he really wished that Naruto could be himself. Though Naru-chan
was closer to his true self than his 'Dobe mask' had been, he still
wasn't the perfect mix of vibrant and calm that was truly himself. 
But he supposed that could make an appearance as soon as they were
settled. Surely, Tsunami wouldn't suspect anything, if Naru-chan got
a little energetic during her pregnancy. Would she?</p><P>It
only took a few days for them to get settled in, and Tazuna took
quite well to having another worker under him, as well as a drinking
buddy for the evenings. Inari seemed to blossom around Naru-chan,
who showed him all sorts of interesting tricks, like how to juggle,
and when to dive to catch a frog. It seemed to be going well, and
occasionally, Naruto would send out a clone to lead the ANBU off
track again. They really were becoming quite a nuisance, and Naruto
actually felt relieved to stretch his Chakra-muscles in tormenting
the poor ANBU teams. With Kyuubi's help it was rather easy to do.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKIT</B></p><P>Sasuke,
during this time, aside form wondering if Naruto was making it
alright, was training his little booty off. He was intent on being
able to meet Naruto again, somewhere in the Mist country. He hoped
to all the Gods he knew of that the Dobe had understood the
cryptogram, and had hurried and found somewhere safe to hide.</p><P>His
team had been re-vamped, to include some new prodigy from one of the
non-ninja families. A really annoying blunette, who seemed to enjoy
tormenting Sakura. The boy was about two months younger than Sakura,
and positively delighted in hitting on Sasuke. This was just the
kind of thing Sasuke had actually hoped would happen for a long time.
 Now, Sakura spent her time beating up the new boy, and Sasuke got
peace and quiet to train in.</p><P>Kakashi,
on the other hand, was fervently wishing he had Naruto back on the
team. A hyper-active trickster he could manage, but a flaming
Sasuke-lover, he really couldn't. He couldn't get a minute alone
with his dear Icha Icha Paradise, not one minute, and it was driving
him mad!!</p><P>Sarutobi
was at his wits end. Two weeks ago, Naruto had escaped the village
hidden in the leaves, and the council was demanding he be found and
placed under arrest, lest he injure someone, or reveal secret
infromation. The third Hokage was beyond exhausted, tired of
listening to his ANBU's reports, every other day, of being tricked by
yet another of Naruto's Bunshins. The ANBU were at a loss, once more
than three of them had gone into Mist territory, so, he ordered them
to come back, until he could think of something else. It was damn
frustrating, seeing as he didn't even know the reason the poor boy
had fled! (COME ON, OLD TIMER, FIGURE IT OUT!!!! -Otaku)</p><P>So,
things sort of went back to normal for a few months, Naruto and
Kyuubi, living a fake life in Mist, and Sasuke working towards
finding Naruto again in the Leaf.</p><P>Until
one day, a mission to fetch a certain bow-bedecked cat led to an
outburst by the new boy, and things REALLY got interesting...</p><P>END
CHAPTER </p><P>Otaku:
 Hi! That was fast huh? Anyway, here's for those of you who don't
know:</p><P>Jinchurikii:
 A demonic vessel, literally meaning human sacrifice.</p><P>Kage
Bunshin: Shadow Clone. (If you don't know this one, you've never
watched Naruto, and what the hell are you doing reading this
fanfiction?)</p><P>Otaku:
and If you need any other translations, send them to me in a review
and I'll try my best. Anyway, that's it for today. I hope you all
liked my version of Naruto, and NO, IT AIN'T OVER!! But I'm seriously
gonna mess with the Tazuna Arc, so have fun with it!!</p><P>Naruto:
We will!</p><P>Otaku:
I wasn't talking to you...</p><P>See
you next time!!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N) Alrighty people,
we're gonna introduce some new characters in this chapter, yes, they
are OC's but hey, Naru-chan's baby is gonna be one to, so don't fret.
 This is going to be setting up some major plot points in the story,
so pay attention. A lot of aimless stuff, is actually a clue or two
to what's going to happen. PAY ATTENTION TO DETAILS!! Anyway, on to
the story!</p><P><B>Kits</B></p><P><B>Pairings:</B> 
KyuuNaru, SasuNaru, gonna be some GaaNaru, GaaSasu, and a little bit
of ShukaKyuu. Also, I'm thinking of pairing Sakura with Ino, and
Hinata with Neji. KakaIruka is always in my stories, their just too
cute! And Iruka deserves some perverted ninja lovin' too!</p><P><B>Warnings:</B> ATTACK
OF THE OC'S!!! Other than that, probably a little bit of
Hormonal!Naruto bashing on Kyuu-chan, Mpreg, but you already know
that, and just a touch of yaoi. (suuuure...) probably Yuri if I can
find somewhere to put it in.</p><P><B>Description:</B> THis
chapter, we get to watch as Tazuna and Kyuu-chan head for Konoha to
get supplies! Will Kyuuto be able to keep his temper in check? or
will the village of Konohagakure feel the wrath of the nine-tailed
fox once again? Sasuke recognises the old fox, but how can he sneak
away from 'copy-nin' Kakashi? Is it possible? And will Kyuu-chan
kill Naruto when he gets home? I wonder...</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B> Unless
you see little chibi-naruness everyday, walking around hand in hand
with Naruto, I don't think so. It is a sign...</p><P><B>Kits Chapter Four- Let
Me Stay</B></p><P>Kyuu-chan ran headlong out
the rolling paper door, followed closely by several vases and a
wallscroll from inside. Inside the room, a fuming Naruto, still in
his henge, looking like a heartbroken brunette, launched a few more
things at 'her' supposed husband. How DARE he?! How COULD he? Tears
made wet tracks down Naru-chan's face, as she slumped down in a
broken sob. She didn't understand, did he WANT to leave her? Did he
not LOVE her anymore? Kyuu-chan, sensing safety, snuck a quick look
in, and seeing Naru in tears, quickly scrambled to her side, pulling
her to him in a hug.</p><P>"Naru-chan, what's
wrong? You know I don't want to do this, but Tazuna swore me the
apprentice position, if i went with him. You know this is
important!" the silent <I>to our facade</I> was left unsaid,
but didn't go unnoticed by Naruto. He calmed, realizing that he
really was being overly emotional, but kept up his mask, crying
softly, holding to Kyuubi, as the redhead crooned to him. It felt
rather nice to have someone to hold onto...</p><P>"You'll come back?
You won't go back to your clan?" Naru asked these questions,
but Naruto did to. After all, now that the fox had his own body (in
essence) he could leave, and not worry, until Naruto died. He turned
tear-laden sea-blue eyes up to the fox spirit, and saw a gentle smile
there. Kyuubi wiped away Naruto's tears gently, knowing that this
really did hurt the former blonde.</p><P>"I promised, didn't
I? You know I never break my promises." It was a promise, it
was an oath, and Naruto knew that as a Demonlord, he couldn't break
it. He sighed, content. Kyuubi would return to him, would come
back, and keep him safe until the kit was born. He nodded into
Kyuu-chan's chest, tears abated, and let go, slowly. The red-headed
demon, nodded, then signalled behind him, where Inari and Tazuna were
waiting, wonderin if the storm was truly over.</p><P>"Kyuu-san, you might
want to consider buying life insurance..." Tazuna commented,
noticing the heavy vases that had been destroyed by his workers
hormonal wife. Kyuuto chuckled, shaking his head. Inari went to
Naru-chan, offering her the daisies he had picked. She took them
with a tear-stained smile.</p><P>"Nah, I can outrun
her. But I really don't like the idea of leaving Naru-cahn,
Tsunami-san, and Inari-kun all by themselves. What if someone
attacks them while we're gone?" Kyuuto looked truly worried
about his little wife, and it was Tazuna's turn to chuckle.</p><P>"Don't worry, I opted
for the bridge-workers to come check on them everyday. They'll be
fine, but that bridge will never get done, if we don't get going
soon. We leave tommorrow, so spend the rest of the day with
Naru-chan. She needs you." Kyuu-chan nodded, and looked over
to Naru-chan, who was talking animatedly with Inari-kun. It was a
heartwarming scene, and he hoped to see it again, only with a
red-headed child at Naruto's knees, and a blonde jinchurikii.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>It had been three days
since Kyuubi had gone with Tazuna to Konoha. Part of the fight
before they left was because of the fact that it was KONOHA, but
Kyuubi had promised not to destroy anything, and to look for clues as
to how close they were to finding them. Naruto didn't want him to
go, but knew that it was important to gather information about their
enemy.</p><P>He hadn't, however, gotten
rid of the aching sadness that he felt whenever he realised he
couldn't snuggle into the warmth of Kyuubi's hair at night. He took
to taking walks in the woods, near the house. Sometimes Inari-chan
came with, and he taught the boy about special herbs that could be
used to make poisons, and ones that were safe to eat. Sometimes he
was alone, and spent this time conversing with Kyuubi, through their
link. This tired him out quickly, though, due to the distance, so he
mostly just walked, looking at nature, and letting it look back.</p><P>So, he wasn't really
surprised when he came to a trail of blood. It probably was from a
wounded animal some hunter grazed. If he followed it, that'd be meat
he could give to Tsunami-san, and then they'd be able to have
something other than vegetarian food. He cringed at the thought of
another meal of all veggies. He followed it, deep into the woods,
twisting and turning, and almost getting himself lost, until he
marked a few trees to keep him from losing his way back. He
followed, quickly, quietly, hoping the animal would just drop dead
soon.</p><P>Turns out, it had.</p><P>In front of him, at the
end of the trail, was a massive fox. It had to be the size of a
small pony, and obviously demonic. It had three tails on it, and a
spear straight through it's heart. What amazed Naruto was that it
had continued moving after that fatal blow. It should of, by all
means, dropped dead on the spot. But that too was answered a few
seconds later, in the form of a mewling whine.</p><P>Naruto moved quickly
towards the corpse of the demon, and what he saw at it's muzzle broke
his heart. A kit, barely old enough to walk, was whining and
nuzzling the foxes snout. The red and white foxling turned to look
at him, shivvering against its mother's corpse. This was a CHILD!
Naruto bit back a sob, knowing what he had to do, he ripped off the
sleeve of his haori, wrapping it around his arm. He slipped forward
towards the scared kitling, holding his haori-covered arm out,
coaxing the little two-tail.</p><P>He got what he wanted, as,
out of desperation and fear, the little Nibi (two-tail) bit down,
hard on the cloth covered appendage. Naruto used the little fox's
own grip against him, and hauled the struggling kit into his arms,
holding him to his (at the moment b-cup) chest. Cradling the baby,
he drudged through Kyuubi's memories for something that would calm
the kit down. He needed it to be calm and shift to child-form. He
had no idea what he was <I>looking</I> for, though!</p><P>"Kyuubi!! What do I
do?!" He hissed.</p><P>The name, however, calmed
the kit, as it turned curious eyes towards the brunette holding it.
Then the fox noticed. It was a henge, an illusion. The creature
holding it, instead of this plain brunette girl, was actually, a
beautiful blonde beta! This was the mate of Kyuubi no Kitsune, his
lord! What in the world? Why was this noble creature holding him? 
What did it want? He had to get back to his mother!</p><P>The fox began struggling
again, but not enough to actually hurt Naruto, and it seemed to the
would-be blonde that it had understood him, atleast a little. He
hissed at the foxling, as it's claws dug through his kimono, cutting
his chest. Damn!</p><P>"Kitling, hush! Turn
to your ningen form!" He ordered, hoping that the Kitsune-child
would understand him. It seemed he did, when the kitling did indeed
shift. Before him, standing next to the giant carcass of it's own
mother, was a small child, who looked like a three year old. He had
short, chin-length, red hair, wild and free, and green eyes, shining
with fear. He was naked, and obviously male. Naruto nodded to the
child.</p><P>"What wrong, lord?"
 The little foxling asked, pointing to his mother. He didn't seem to
understand that she was dead. Naruto felt his heartstrings tug. 
This child needed a mother, needed family. It wasn't right that he
have none. Naruto stepped closer to the child, holding a hand out to
stave off his fear.</p><P>"Little one, your
mother has been killed. I'm sorry." He waited for that to sink
in, as the spring-green eyes filled with tears. The child shook his
head, trying to banish this foul news. His mother, dead? No, no,
she was just sleeping, surely! He moved to wake her, and was
instead, caught in the strong, warm arms of the henge'd lord. The
gentle rumble of the elders voice lulled him into sobbing, his fear
and pain shoving the entire world aside. He saw nothing, heard
nothing, and felt only pain, as he cried into the ripped kimono.</p><P>Naruto knew he couldn't
leave this child here, demon or not. This child needed a purpose, or
he'd be another sasuke, willing to sacrifice his life for power, for
revenge. He tugged the boys face up, looking into the pain-filled
green eyes.</p><P>"Child, what is your
name?" He asked, hoping to calm the boy a bit, while standing,
holding the child close to his chest.</p><P>"Tsubasa, lord."
 He sobbed, not knowing why.</p><P>"Tsubasa-kun, would
you like a home?" Naruto asked, smiling a little as the boy
scrunched his face in lack of understanding. "I can give you a
home, but you have to swear not to attack the humans who live there,
okay?"</p><P>Tsubasa didn't understand,
but this lord was offering him a home, a place in the world he
severely lacked now that his mother was dead. He nodded, swearing. 
The blonde Lord grinned widely, and, taking out a kunai, sawed
through the bone and muscle of one of the tails off his mother, took
it over his shoulder. Cradling Tsubasa to him, he took off towards
the house.</p><P>Naruto quicky made it back
to Tsunami-san's house, pulling open the door, calling for the
mistress of the house. She came, and crying out in surprise, took
Tsubasa from the little brunette girl. She noted the cuts on the
kimono, the torn haori, and the bloodied child.</p><P>"I found him in the
woods, his parents ripped apart by a demon-beast. It was mostly
dead, I just struck the final blow, and took its tail for the boy. 
His name is Tsubasa. His mother's dying wish was that I take care of
him. I didn't know what to do, Tsunami-san!" Naru-chan burst
into tears, faked of course, but Tsunami believed the excellent
actor. She took the child into the kitchen, motioning for Naru-chan
to follow. The brunette did, and the child was quickly washed up,
and found to have minor injuries. Then Tsunami turned to Naruto,
wrapping up his chest (which, thanks to the henge, <I>felt</I> like a
woman's chest too.), and cleaning the scrapes and bruises he had
henge'd onto himself.</p><P>So, with Tsubasa-kun in a
bright blue child's kimono, and Naru-chan in one of her fresh green
ones, all was well. The todler obviously clung to Naru-chan, but
Tsunami saw nothing wrong with this, the boy was smart, but he had
just gone through a tremendous trauma. He was allowed to be clingy.</p><P>And so, time passed, and
they settled into a new routine.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Sasuke was pissed.</p><P>Their last three missions
had all been to round up cats, dogs or occasionally, children, which
was FAR worse. He REALLY wanted a different mission. Hopefully, one
that let him outside the walls of this damn city. But he wouldn't
say anything to the Hokage, who would probably think he was going to
go find Naruto. Which he was, but that wasn't the point, dammit!</p><P>So, when the third member
of their team, Tohru Kasuki, the flaming Sasuke feind, accosted the
Hokage for a new mission, both inner Sakura and inner Sasuke were
rooting for him. The boy was so convincing, the Hokage, miserable
old bastart, DID give them a mission, and one outside even! They
were supposed to escort two people from Konoha to the Mist. Inner
Sasuke was jumping for joy! He'd have to take a look at the roster
for his fan-club, he was pretty sure he'd find a couple of godesses
in there!</p><P>But he was even HAPPIER,
when he saw just who it was he was to be 'escorting'. Kyuubi! He
almost laughed right there, at the thought that the great nine-tailed
fox demon, would need a few ninja to keep him safe. HAH! He grinned
a secret Uchiha grin for the red-head, and the fox noticed.</p><P>Kyuubi wasn't a
supersticious demon, but this was down right eerie. Here he was, the
Uchiha, set to escort Tazuna and him back to the Mist, where Naruto
was waiting with open arms. This was just too good. He grinned and
decided to play with the ninja a bit.</p><P>"This all you sending
with us? They're just brats!"he chuckled. The reaction
was instantaneous. The other boy, the one who wasn't the Uchiha,
growled low in his throat, while the pink-haired freak looked
suddenly unsure of herself. Tazuna agreed beside him, hefting his
sake bottle, and taking a deep drink. Kyuubi turned to his empoyer,
and said, "Tazuna-san, perhaps we should just go. We staved off
the bandits last time. We can do it again."</p><P>Tazuna tutted at him.
"Now, now, Kyuu-chan, you need to think of poor Naru-san at
home. What would she do, if we died on the way. You don't want to
widow her with a child on the way!" He really did wonder at this
boy's carefree attitude. He had a wife at home, he needed to think
more!</p><P>"Don't worry,
Kyuu-sama, you have me, as well." The silver haired copy-nin
said, bowing a little, while keeping his eyes on his book. Kyuubi
looked at him, inwardly scoffing. He could flick this man away like
a flea, with a single one of his tails. But he promised not to start
anything with this village.</p><P>"Alright, whatever,
let's get going. Naru-chan's gonna tan my hide when I get home since
we're gonna be late." Kyuuto said, turning on his heel and
stalking out. The Hokage waved them off, glad to get rid of the
moody red-head and his employer. Sasuke was almost jumping for joy,
so obviously, there was a slight hop to his step. Kyuubi noticed
this, and determined to get him some alone time with the blonde. 
They need it, seeing as they were so damned worried about each other.</p><P>During the trip, they all
had to take it at Tazuna's pace, which was like a leisurely walk for
the rest. They were quite happy under the clear blue sky, talking
about random things. Until Tazuna brought it up.</p><P>"So, while we were in
town, every one was really tense. What happened?" He asked,
trying to keep the conversation going. He noticed the suddenly icy
air about the konoha nins. Hell, a snowman, would be able to notice
the ice around them. Sakura looked pissed for some reason, while
Tohru just seemed slightly miffed. Kakashi looked a little strained,
but still had on his mask, so it was hard to tell. Sasuke looked
down right murderous.</p><P>"A very dangerous
ninja ran away from the village a few weeks ago." Kakashi said,
giving the bare basics. Kyuubi couldn't help the tiny smile that
came to his face, and he was forced to play it off.</p><P>"So go get him,
jeeze." Kyuubi said, joking tone implying that they needn't
drag it out. Kakashi looked at him with an annoyed expression.</p><P>"We have tried. He,
somehow, manages to confuse our ANBU so badly that we can't find
him." Sakura said, sadly. Kakashi shot her a <I>look</I>, the
kind of look that said, 'Don't bother opening your mouth anymore, or
I'll cut out your tongue and feed it to a cow.' She shut her mouth.</p><P>Tazuna just 'hmmmed'. 
They were nearing the river, after several days of travel, a full
week. They were walking along the route that the supplies would
travel by in a few months, when Kakashi noted something on the
ground. He looked at his other companions, and the only one who
noted it, was the young red-head. This struck Kakashi as odd, but he
only had time to produce a Kawarimi, when the demon-brothers ripped
it in half.</p><P>Tohru, the minute the
water hit the air, and the log appeared, jumped straight into the
tree, looking around, trying to figure out what was going on. 
Meanwhile, Sakura was shocked, and Sasuke was trying to figure out
where the enemy is coming from. Kyuubi was crouching low, looking
around, trying to figure it out too.</p><P>"Tazuna-san, you
didn't tell me we had NINJA'S AFTER US!!" He roared, trying to
figure out how to survive while still staying in his facade. Within
seconds, the two demon-brothers were tied to a tree with their own
chain, and Kakashi stood there, grinning, looking at Tazuna.</p><P>"So, why did you lie
to Konoha, mister Tazuna?" He asked. (alrighty, people, it
get's weird here, becuase I don't really know the time length between
the demon-brothers and Zabuza, so...Well, it's about to get VERY
fun.) But got no answer, as a giant meat cleaver slammed into a tree
a few feet away from them. It was just quivvering there for a second
until Tohru jumped down from his tree, breathing hard, and screaming.</p><P>"EVERYONE RUN!!"</p><P>All hell broke loose, as a
ninja appeared on the sword, standing there as if he didn't have a
care in the world. Sakura, ordered by Kakashi, took up a sentry
position in between Tazuna and the strange ninja. Sasuke, out of
concern, did the same for Kyuubi. The ninja began a strange dialogue
with Kakashi, and Sasuke was able to sneak a whispered conversationg
with the red-headed fox.</p><P>"How is Naruto?"</p><P>Kyuubi grinned, "Fine
as anyone pregnant can be. One hell of a right hook, though"</p><P>Sasuke shook his head,
"Damn."</p><P>Until suddenly, there was
a Ninja in front of him. Sasuke dodged a kunai, dropping under the
missing-nin's gaurd, landing a kick up into the ninja's jaw (think
rock lee), knocking him back into Kakashi. The silver haired man,
after an exchange of water jutsus, managed to get behind the enemy
ninja, revealed to be Zabuza, one of the former Mist-Swordmen. But
just as he was about to strike the killing blow, a rain of needles
punctured Zabuza's windpipe, killing him. His body fell to the
ground, and was gathered up by a masked nin who claimed to be a
Nin-hunter.</p><P>Kakashi collapsed, and
they were forced to carry him back to Tazuna's home.</p><P>The minute the door opened
and Kyuubi called, "We're home!", a brunette missile
attached itself to him, in a blur of tears and "oh, thank
gods!"'s. This brunette girl, later identified as Naru-chan,
was attached to her husband, who had a silver-haired jounin in his
arms. She looked down at him, looked up at Kyuubi, looked down at
Kakashi, then looked up, positively livid.</p><P>"You drag home a
prostitute?!" She screamed, and it was on. Kyuubi passed the
jounin onto Tazuna, and took off running, being chased by the little
brunette, who was throwing anything 'she' could get her hands on. 
Sasuke looked at the brunette, unable to see his blonde friend in the
little spitfire. Tazuna took Kakashi into another room, ignoring the
sounds of the chase, until, as he put Kakashi into the futon, a
scream and then a wail was heard.</p><P>Elsewhere, Naruto was
chasing Kyuubi, and was surprised to find that, just a little off to
the side, Tsubasa had seen him, and was now screaming and crying,
becuase he thought another bad person was trying to steal away his
Naru-dono! Kyuubi froze. He recognised that kind of cry. That was
a cry of fear, from a henge'd fox demon. He turned to the sound, and
sure enough, a little red-headed boy, with bright green eyes, was
crying and pointing at him. He growled low in his throat, and the
child immediately stopped.</p><P>"<B>Naru! </B>Care
to tell me what this boy is DOING here?" Kyuubi said, voice low
and dangerous. The humans sure as fuck didn't know the boy was a
demon, otherwise they'd have killed him, and he wasn't about to send
the kit to death, all for a mix up. Naruto ran into him, and was
caught, inside the circle of kyuubi's strong arms. He looked up into
furious crimson eyes, and swallowed hard.</p><P>"He was orphaned,
Kyuu. I didn't know what else to do, so, I decided he'd be the
retainer for our child, like my old nurse, only younger. We can
teach him to defend himself, and he can protect the baby. Is
that...okay?" He asked, playing his submissive card. He knew
that Kyuubi would calm down, and think about it rationally. And he
was right, the fox did. He let go of Naru, and crouching down in
front of the boy, lifting his head with a single finger, looking into
clear green-eyes, noting that the boy had the feel of a two-tail
around him, and thinking it over.</p><P>"Alright, Naru, but I
don't want him coddled. He's a servant, a protector, and he better
know it by the time the child is born." Sakura looked at Kyuubi
like he was heartless, while Sasuke and Tohru looked on carefully.</p><P>"Kyuuto-san, how
could you! The boy's an orphan, you should take him into your family
as a son, not as a servant!" The pink-haired Genin spoke,
inadvertantly turning Kyuubi's irrate temper onto her. Kyuubi's
brown (he henge'd them) eyes to her, with a glare of immense
ferocity, as he turned to face her.</p><P>"Girl, I have a clan
to build. I need my heir to be protected. If that child was
adopted, he would be ousted the minute my child was born. As a
servant, his place in the family is secured forever. Wouldn't that
be better, to be a servant, but always family, than to be family and
pushed to the side with the birth of your younger sibling, who would
inherit everything?" He watched as Sakura gaped, then turned to
Naru, pulling 'her' into a 'welcome home' kiss, and leaving to go
hunting.</p><P>Naru sighed, gathering
Tsubasa into his arms, cradling the poor child, who, though in awe,
looked like he was in shock. He turned towards the others, and
though he desperately wanted to glomp Sasuke the way he had Kyuubi,
he knew that would ruin all their work. He turned on his soft, wifey
smile, and looked between Sakura, Tohru, and Sasuke.</p><P>"Well, hello? Who do
we have here?" He said, his voice soft, but still his own, high
due to impending pubescence. (come on guys, he's fourteen.)</p><P>"Uchiha Sasuke,
ma'am, a pleasure to meet you." Sasuke said, a smirk on his
face. Naruto blushed a bit, and realized that Sasuke had been
worried. He seemed thoroughly releaved that Naruto was alright.</p><P>Sakura stepped forward,
intent on coddling Tsubasa, who had a look on his face equal to,
"Naru-dono, get this crazy ningen female away from me!!"
and buried his face into Naru's scarlet and silver kimono. "I'm
Haruno Sakura, please to meet you, Naru- umm.." She looked up,
unsure of how to adress her, as the wife of a lord, or a servant of
Tazuna's home.</p><P>"You can call me
Naru-chan, dear, I'm not a noble anymore, though my husband wishes I
could be." She smiled sadly.</p><P>"Kasuki Tohru,
Naru-chan, how old is the boy?" He asked, looking simply
curious. Naru looked to Tsubasa, and then smiled up at Tohru.</p><P>"I'm not exactly
sure, Tohru-san. I haven't asked him yet."</p><P>Sakura took it upon
herself to ask, "How old are you, Tsubasa-kun?" And the
little fox-boy held up two hands. Naruto looked shocked, laughing it
off as quickly as possible.</p><P>"He's probably no
older than three. See? He doesn't even know how to count yet..."
 Naru said, pulling some rice-candy out of his sleeve to give to
Tsubasa, shooing the boy off. "Here, come with me, I'll get you
situated for your stay in Tazuna-sama's house." Naru took them
down a hall, opening two rooms up to air out.</p><P>"Why do you call him
'Tazuna-sama', while your husband calls him 'Tazuna-san'?" 
Sakura asked, tilting her head curiously.</p><P>"Becuase I was raised
as the eldest daughter of my clan, while Kyuuto-chan was raised as
the thirteenth son." Naruto laughed off, noting that to tell
Kyuubi.</p><P><B>Got it, kit, I'll make
sure not to screw it up.</B></p><P>"How old are you,
Naru-chan?" Tohru asked, curious.</p><P>"Fourteen,
Tohru-san." Naru answered, matter of fact. Inari chose that
moment to come in, tugging on the sleeve of Naruto's kimono.</p><P>"Naru-chan, Mama
said, she needs to know if Kyuu-san went hunting for dinner or not."
 He said, holding his hand out. Naru sighed, but smiled. He must
have seen the rice-candy that Tsubasa was munching on, and now wanted
some.</p><P>"Tell your mother,
yes, Kyuu-chan did go hunting, and he'll probably be back very soon."
 He said, pulling some of the sticky confection out of his sleeve,
handing it to the boy, with a kiss in his hair. "Now, go along
and play with Tsubasa-kun."</p><P>The boy giggled and ran
off, leaving Sakura with a wide smile at the display of motherly
affection, and Sasuke with a slight smirk. 'Always knew the dobe
would be a good mother.' Naru turned towards them, a warm look on
her face, and nodded to each.</p><P>"Dinner will be ready
an hour after Kyuu-chan gets back, so be prepared. Let's let the
prostitute rest for a while, shall we?" Naru still didn't
understand that Kakashi wasn't a prostitute, and in the face of her
brilliant smile, all of the genin face-faulted.</p><P>END CHAPTER </p><P>Otaku: So! whaddya think?</p><P>Naruto: Wow, I'm a bitch

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N) I'm back!!!!! And
I'm here with a brand new Chappie!! So enjoy, all my chocolate
flavored tasty reviewers!! Tee hee! (I'm a little obsessed with
chocolate, seeing as it's easter soon...) So, read and review!</p><P><B>Kits</B></p><P><B>Pairings:</B>
Definately Kyuu/Naru, some Naru/Sasu, too. Gonna be quite a bit of
Naru/Gaa once he gets here... It's a love quadrangle between Naruto,
Kyuubi, Sasuke, and Gaara with a little bit of Shukaku in there for
spice!! tee hee! Also, I'm adding some Zabuza/Haku, just cause I
think the pairing totally rocks! (But you gotta squint REALLY hard to
see it in THIS chappie...)</p><P><B>Warnings: </B> Yaoi,
Pervertedness on Kyuu-chan's part, Snarky Sasuke (I hope! 3!) 
And quite a bit of Preggers!Naru!</p><P><B>Description:</B> Now
that Sasu-chan's in the same place as his friends, they are making
plans! But can they do it with a suspicious Kakashi, a curious Inari,
and an oblivious Tsunami at their heels? And what about Sakura, who
damn-well stalks our poor Sasu-chan! We'll just have to see, now
won't we?</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B> If I
owned Naruto, no one would have to worry about his pranks. He'd be
too tired...wink</p><P><B>Kits Chapter 5 -Where
the Wind Will Whisper to Me</B></p><P>Naru-chan was in high
spirits, and ushered her 'husband' off to talk with the men, whilst
she and Tsunami-san prepared dinner. Sasuke, to tell the truth, had
never seen the Dobe this happy. It was almost as if all his worries
were gone. And the way he handled the children! He was a natural
mother, and a fair one to boot! Sasuke was starting to become a
little jealous of Kyuubi, which made the perverted Fox grin when he
read the boy's body language.</p><P>Kyuubi was having trouble
keeping his hands off of his pregnant mate-to-be (Atleast, he would
be if Kyuubi had anything to say about it...). There was just
something about thinking that there was a life inside the pretty
little blonde that gave a guy a raging hard-on. He was having
trouble, and he figured the best remedy would be for them to get
somewhere safe, completely safe, that he could concentrate on whooing
the little Jinchurikii.</p><P>Kakashi was still
sleeping, and no one really blamed him...</p><P>Sasuke, meanwhile, was
having fun joking around (read in sasuke-speak: sounding bitchy) with
Kyuubi. Sakura and Tohru were positive that the two hated one
another.</p><P>"So, Kyuu-san, how'd
you hook up with a little spitfire like that, anyway?" Sasuke
asked, a snarky tone to his voice. Kyuubi grinned.</p><P>"Well, you see, I was
drunk at a festival, and so was she, and somehow, her retainers just
ran off right? Well, she dug me, and started hitting on me, really
hard right? So, we got to talking, and I was romancing the hell out
of her, and she got to telling me about how she hated being the
first-born, and I was thanking my lucky stars I wasn't first born. 
We started to really like each other by the end of the night, and I
managed to get her to sleep with me. After wards, we told each other
our clan names, and swore to see each other again. Two weeks later,
there Naru-chan is, on my doorstep in tears, she's pregnant and her
clan kicked her out. So I did what any honorable man would do. I
married her, and I'm learning to love her, like she's learning to
love me." Here a wistful look came across his face, and Sasuke,
in spite of knowing it was a fake story, smiled softly.</p><P>"I wouldn't mind that
kind of arrangement." Sasuke said, sitting back. Suddenly
Sakura latched onto him and ruined all of those pretty thoughts. He
sighed, and frowned.</p><P>"Tazuna-san, when did
you take in Kyuu-san and Naru-chan?" Tohru asked, out of no
where. Tazuna looked surprised, but thoguht about it for a moment.</p><P>"About two months
ago, if I remember correctly..." (Tazuna has a bad memory,
guys...)</p><P>Tohru nodded. He was
curious by nature, but something didn't add up. This man didn't seem
like a noble, and his wife was just a little suspicious. Something
about her smacked of a Henge. But what would she hide? He
personally didn't care, so long as his Sasuke-kun was safe, and he
could advance his power.</p><P>Sakura was beggining to
wonder what all the questions from Tohru was about. Did he notice
something they missed? But Sasuke-kun would have seen anything she
had missed! (delusional bitch. -Otaku) Perhaps he was just an
inquisitive person.</p><P>"Dinner's ready!"
 Came the cheerful voice of Naru-chan, who soon appeared, a little
red-headed boy on her hip, and three serving dishes balanced on her
hand, head, and one in her mouth. How she talked like this will
forever remain a mystery. She set Tsubasa-kun down at his place at
the rather large table, and then moved to put the plates down, but,
being unable to bend properly, failed, miserably. Both Kyuu and
Sasuke got up to help her, and, with a smile and a faint rosy blush,
dinner was served.</p><P>It was a sumptuous meal,
the best Tazuna and Tsunami could afford, supplemented by the mystery
meat that Kyuuto had returned with. It was positively multiplied by
the skill with which Tsunami and Naru cooked (Naruto could cook
before hand, he just didn't feel it necessary if there was only him
and Sasuke that needed feeding.) Everyone dug in, with the children
nestled happily around Naru-chan, who was, slowly but surely,
teaching Tsubasa how to use Chopsticks. It was a very peaceful
scene, and it appeared to be infecting the adults as well.</p><P>Kyuubi was having fun. 
Fun that didn't involve killing and/or maiming something, which was
EXTREMELY rare. Tazuna had, once again, challenged Kyuuto to a
drinking contest, and Kyuubi was having the aforementioned fun by
trying to act drunk, but not too drunk, while trying to stay away
from the proper amounts that would GET him drunk. Naru-chan was
cheering him on, clapping her hands, with that radiant bell laugh,
while Tsunami was cheering her father on. Tsubasa was simply
watching, while Sasuke was smirking in the corner, as if he knew
something no one else did.</p><P>Sakura and Tohru were
arguing over what sexuality Sasuke was, until Tohru brought up his
fashion sense, and Sakura said, "So what! Look at
Kakashi-sensei, he's got fashion sense, and he's straight as a
sword!"</p><P>Tohru just looked at her
and shook his head.</p><P>Everyone was laughing as
she spluttered, wondering what she had missed. Kyuubi laughed the
most, and, through tears in his eyes, he tried to explain.</p><P>"Sakura-chan, listen,
the hentai porn he's always reading? It's the yaoi editions. All
the 'girls' are guys, hun!" He crowed out, laughing again.</p><P>"H-how do YOU know?!"
 She yelled, blushing furiosly. Sasuke had borrowed some from
Sensei...</p><P>"I'm bi, sweetheart,
and before I was married, I thoroughly enjoyed the company of ANY
pretty person." He stated, still laughing. However, he was
quickly rewarded with a bowl of sweet-and-sour chicken over the head,
curtesy of a pissed off Naru-chan. He spent the rest of the meal
grovelling, and everyone else laughed at his misfortune.</p><P>Slowly, the meal died
down, as the children, including Sakura fell asleep, one by one. 
Kyuuto was done grovelling, and was instead, helping Naru-chan put
the children into bed. All the ninja slept in one room, while the
two boys shared a room, and Naruto finally managed to catch a little
time with Sasuke, while Kyuubi led a discussion of the bridge in the
living room.</p><P>Naru-chan slipped outside,
sitting on the porch, where Sasuke was looking to the moon. His
midnight-dark eyes turned to the little brunette, and here, with her
smiling softly at the moon, he could see it. He could see his best
friend and confidante in the little dark-haired spitfire. He cleared
his throat, calling Naruto's attention to him.</p><P>"How have you been,
'Naru-chan'?" he asked, his voice low. Naruto smiled, a big
grin, just like normal, and Sasuke felt his heart melt.</p><P>"I've been great,
Sasuke. Having to hide your real personality is a little hard, but
I've been doing pretty good. The baby's just fine, and Kyuu-chan is
taking good care of me." He said, tuning all his attention on
the dark-haired boy.</p><P>"So, is that boy-?"
Sasuke was interrupted by a slim hand.</p><P>"Yes, Tsubasa-kun is
just like Kyuu-chan." Naruto said, his smile faltering a bit.
"I saw his mother, Sasuke. She was torn apart. I'm surprised
she made it that far, but...She had a baby to protect." He
slipped his hands down to cradle his own abdomen. Soon it would be
swollen with the child, and he didn't know if he could protect it. 
He didn't know if he would end up just like that Kitsune, dying to
protect her child and leaving it all alone in the world. He choked
back a sob. "I don't want to leave it all alone, Sasuke. I
can't do that to my baby." He said, curling into himself,
around his unborn child.</p><P>Sasuke, new to this,
stared for a few seconds, before sighing, and pulling the sobbing
Dobe to him, cradling the former blonde. "You won't have to. 
Dobe, you've got Kyuu-chan to protect you and the baby, and..." 
He lowered to a whisper, "You've got me. I won't leave you
alone, Naruto. I'll protect you." He uchiha-grinned at the
crying boy, "After all, if I didn't, who'd bear my children?"
 and he kissed the invisible stripes on his friends cheek, and then
he was gone, back inside, and Naruto was alone in the moonlight, but
feeling infinitely better.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Sasuke took to gaurding
Tazuna while Sakura stayed back at the house with Naru-chan and
Tsunami-san. Tohru flitted back and forth throughout the day. Three
days went by, until Kakashi woke up, and then, there was a VERY
interesting conversation that went something like this...</p><P>"Kyuu-chan! The
Prostitute is awake!!" Naru-chan screamed in the early hours of
the morning on the third day. This, accordingly, awoke the other
three ninja in the room, the two children in the room next to it, and
on the other side of that room, Kyuubi, all from a dead-sleep. You
see, Naru-chan had been up early, so he decided to clean up a bit,
right? Well, he had been cleaning around the ninja's room, picking
up dirty clothes, and putting away kunai, and all of a sudden, he was
flipped over, onto his back, with a knee between his legs, and a
Kunai to his throat.</p><P>This was how Kyuuto found
his 'wife' in the next few minutes, and he, subsequently, tackled the
ninja, and in a display of common-worker power, straddled said ninja.
 This lead to him being attacked repeatedly with a feather duster by
his darling little wife, who was just sure that he was fooling around
on her, and only when Sasuke yelled out, "Everybody shut up, or
I'll pull an Itachi!" did everyone shut up and look at the
half-awake avenger. His defense later would be, "Well, it
worked, didn't it?"</p><P>Everyone got settled down,
and Kyuu-chan was forced to restrain his lovely, pregnant wife, lest
she attack the man she had dubbed the 'Prostitute'. And this was how
Kakashi woke up! Yay!!</p><P>So, there Kakashi was,
blinking his one eye, the other still covered by that hitai-ate(the
headband, people, the headband.) and his mask, newly in place, while
everyone sat around him. He eyed the little red-head, the big
red-head, and the homicidal brunette. Meanwhile, Tohru was offering
him some of the breakfast that Tsunami had made, and Tazuna was
laughing heartily by his bedside.</p><P>"Now, did anyone get
the number of the bus that ran me over?" Kakashi joked, causing
everyone, including Kyuubi to facefault. "No, seriously, now,
did anyone see that hunter-nin again?"</p><P>Everyone shook their head,
while Naru-chan just said, "What hunter-nin? Why is there a
hunter-nin after my Kyuuto-chan?!"</p><P>"Look, miss, no one
is after your-"</p><P>"I will have you
know, Mr. Prostitute, I am not a 'miss' anything! I am Kitamura Naru,
and I am MARRIED to this man, right here, the one I'm holding! So,
I'll thank you not to hit on him or I. We are TAKEN. Understand?"
 She said, and Kakashi sighed, desperate to just kill the little
brunette, but then Iruka would find out and he'd be in trouble, and
probably not get sex for weeks, and that just wasn't worth it.</p><P>"Look, Mrs. Kitamura,
I am NOT a prostitute, and I will not be hitting on you or your
husband. I have a boyfriend, and he's a little insecure, but I love
him. So you have nothing to worry about." Naru-chan grinned in
relief, and the rest of them, minus Kyuu, who, lucky dog, was getting
kissed, and Tazuna, who was just laughing, had various reactions that
I am about to state.</p><P>Tohru was pumping his fist
in the air, rubbing it in to Sakura.</p><P>Sakura was looking around,
completely confused.</p><P>Sasuke was looking
slightly disgusted, while trying to figure out who his boyfriend
could POSSIBLY be.</p><P>Tsunami was slightly
surprised, while still serving out dishes.</p><P>Inari was utterly shocked.</p><P>Tsubasa just sniffed the
strange man, and sure enough there was the smell of a beta on him. 
This settled it for the little fox, and he sat back down by his
Naru-dono.</p><P>Back to the actual
situation, now, ok? Ok.</p><P>Kakashi was now regaling
them with the news that Zabuza was still quite alive and kicking. 
This, however, needed some explanation, as Naru-chan STILL didn't
know what was going on. So, after the brief explanation of the
battle, and the subsequent chase of Kyuu by Naru due to the lack of
informing, they all settled back down to talk it over. Kakashi had
decided to take his team out to train, seeing as they would need it
in the fight against Zabuza, who, quite likely, could attack whenever
he wanted.</p><P>"Please, take
Tsubasa-kun with you." Naru-chan said, going into a
beggars-bow, forehead to the floor. "I think he might be from a
Ninja clan, I don't know for certain, but he needs to be trained in
self-defense, if he is to protect my baby when it is born. I beg
you."</p><P>Kakashi sighed. This
brunette was nearly as troublesome on her own as Naruto had been!
Jeeze! But, he did want to talk to the red-headed man, so, what the
hell, "Let's make it a day out, for everyone." And promtly
found himself with an armful of brunette. Naru-chan was glomping
him!</p><P>"THANK YOU!! Thank
you so much, thank you!" She said, laughing happily, bouncing
in his lap. This might become a problem...Until suddenly, out of
nowhere, a pissed off Kyuu snatched up his hyper, happy wife, and
stalked off with her. Sasuke, for the first time in recorded
history, was laughing his ass off, holding his stomach and rolling
around on the ground, while everyone else just looked confused.</p><P>So, a day out it
was.Tazuna told everyone to take a day off from the bridge, and all
the workers went home to their wives, families, and (for those
losers...) pets. Tsunami, Inari, Tsubasa, and Naru-chan prepared a
picnic basket, while everyone else packed up training supplies. They
left before the sun was even properly up, and they were bounding
through the forest at a leisurely pace, the ninja sparring while they
were going. This had started when Tohru attacked Sakura to keep her
gaurd up, and it turned into a full blown ninja-sparring-battle.</p><P>They soon found a clearing
with some nice flowers in it, and Tsunami set about gathering some of
them. Inari joined her, as did Tsubasa, and soon, they had
flower-crowns for each person. The training started after their
outdoors breakfast. Kakashi took Tohru, Sakura and Sasuke to one of
the huge trees and started them on a tree-walking excercise. Naruto
quickly memorised the theory of it, so that he could practise later,
on his own. He needed better chakra control, especially if this
disguising business was going to continue.</p><P>Tsubasa turned out to be a
natural at chakra control, and was quickly (read able to do it by the
end of the day) able to complete the excercise. This astounded
Kakashi, who had never seen a three year old child able to control
that amount of chakra before. And the way Naru-chan praised him, you
would think that wasn' t the only thing he was capable of. He began
to wonder where the boy's parents were.</p><P>"Kyuuto-san, may I
speak with you for a moment?" Kakashi called the young man off
to the side. He surveyed the grace the red-head moved with,
realising that it shouldn't belong to a nineteen year old, even one
of noble stature. That's the kind of grace a warrior gets after
years of combat experience, not a young boy, barely on his own. 
Something was up here.</p><P>"Yup, Kakashi-san?"
 He said, an easygoing grin on his face.</p><P>"Where are Tsubasa's
parents? I'm curious to meet them."</p><P>"They were
slaughtered by a three tailed fox-demon. My wife rescued him,
killing the beast with a lucky strike. Then she took him in as a
retainer for our unborn child." Kyuubi lied effortlessly. 
Foxes are tricksters, and lying is the simplest of tricks. Too bad
Kakashi was suspicious about other things as well.</p><P>"Just curious, but
what country did you say you ran from?" Kakashi asked,
determined to find out later what they told Tazuna.</p><P>"Rock country. Why?"
 Kyuubi was a little suspicious now, surely Kakashi hadn't figured it
out already?</p><P>"No reason, just
thought your wife looked a little familiar." It was a bluff. 
Surely a bluff, but Kyuubi couldn't help looking over to see if it
was true. Was Naruto's Henge wearing off? No, it was still in
place, and Naruto noticed, smiling over at 'her' husband. This was
bad. No Ningen made Kyuubi no Kitsune nervous! None!</p><P>"Don't know how she
could, she's never set foot in Konoha. Maybe you saw in in Rock,
when she was little, on one of you missions?" Kyuubi was
grasping straws, and Kakashi noticed. He was hiding something, and
Kakashi intended to find out.</p><P>"Hey, Sasuke-kun,
would you help me with my training?" Tohru asked, smiling
brightly. That smile reminded Sasuke a little too much of Naruto's
smiles. He shook his head, indicating he was hungry. Sakura
however, made eating a little bit impossible, while she was hanging
onto his arm like that...</p><P>He growled low in his
throat, and Naruto noticed. He decided to tease the black-haired
boy.</p><P>"Sasuke-kun, it looks
like you have some admirers! Perhaps you could settle down, and quit
doing such dangerous work?" Naru-chan asked, 'innocently'.</p><P>Sasuke glared at her, as
Sakura started cooing over how cute his kids would look, and Tohru
pouted. He would have to get the Dobe back for that...</p><P>And he did, during the
impromptu water fight. They all got soaked, as Tohru, helping
Tsubasa with a few jutsu's, created improvised water balloons, and
the war was on. THey even managed to get a poor village girl all
wet, when she came to the clearing to gather herbs. She wasn't upset
though, and even joined in for a few moments, before collapsing,
breathless from laughter, next to the equally soaked Naru-chan. The
two women watched the group, as they ran around soaking each other
and the wildlife.</p><P>"They're a lively
group, huh?" Naruto laughed, as Kyuubi dumped a bucket of water
in Sasuke's shorts.</p><P>"They sure are. They
must be your precious people, hm?" The girl smiled at Naruto,
beautiful, with her long dark hair.</p><P>"Absolutely." 
Naruto answered, without a blink. He smiled too, putting a hand to
his stomach, feeling that anticipation again, that wonderful feeling
of life there. The girl noticed, and blinked. Then she looked up
into Naruto's sky-blue eyes.</p><P>"Are you pregnant?"
 She asked. Naruto grinned and nodded his head vigorously. The girl
smiled, "Congratulations! I hope it lives a long and healthy
life!"</p><P>"Me too!" Naruto
laughed. The girl got up, smoothing her kimono out, and picking up
her basket. She looked up, closing her eyes.</p><P>"Thank you for the
water-fight. It's nice. I come from a place where it snows a lot,
and I miss getting wet. I'm going to go now, though. My precious
person is waiting." She turned to leave. "Oh, and you
should know, I'm a boy."</p><P><I>He </I> exited the
clearing, leaving a confused and bewildered Naruto. He could have
sworn...That's just not right, man. But then, he couldn't really
talk, now could he? Kyuubi on the other hand, he was suspicious. 
The girl didn't make sense, and her voice was VERY familiar. It
reminded him, somehow, of Senbon needles...</p><P>Naru-chan was grilled
about the disappearance of the village girl, but no one let it bother
their day that she had went back home. And their day went on.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Haku found himself the
recipient of a smile, a large smile that adorned his face all the way
back to Zabuza's hideout. He was very glad he had met the brunette
girl. She had given him thoughts about life without constantly being
on the run, without having to worry about who's going to kill them
next. It really hurt him everytime his precious person had to bloody
his hands more and more.</p><P>He could see it, in
Zabuza's face after every battle. He didn't want to fight anymore,
but he continued. He had to protect Haku, he had to get money so
that they could live peacefully. There was no other job, all Ninja
were good for was battle.</p><P>"Zabuza-san, I'm
back. I have the herbs for your neck." Haku said, smiling at
his older companion. The spiky-haired man frowned through his mask.</p><P>"Haku, why are you
wet?" He asked, curious to know. His personality, however,
tainted it, making it sound hostile. Haku knew better, and answered
calmly, to appease his master's curiousity.</p><P>"I met with our
enemies, in the field with these herbs. They're kind people. It's a
shame we have to kill the old man." He barely finished the
sentance before a restraining grip was on his wrist, and he found
himself trapped by a hard body. Zabuza hissed in his ear.</p><P>"Don't speak like
that, Haku. You are my weapon, you must stay well-honed at all
times." Zabuza hadn't meant to sound so impersonal. He had
been trying to tell the boy to be careful, to not let his gaurd down,
lest he be hurt, but it never came out as he intended. He always
hurt little Haku.</p><P>Haku smiled, with a beauty
few women could match, up at his master, "I know, Zabuza-san. I
am your weapon, do as you will with me." The submission was a
delicate one, a bearing of his soul, for he truly was this man's
pawn. He could never go against his word, never turn his back on the
man who had taken him in when he was condemned a murderer.</p><P>Zabuza smiled, behind his
mask, and nodded. He let the boy go, letting him get back to his
tasks, while Zabuza prepared for the upcoming battle. It would take
a lot to beat the Copy-nin of Konoha. Zabuza wasn't sure if he would
survive this time. He didn't know what he was going to do. Either
him or Haku could end up dying in this new battle, and he knew life
wasn't worth living without his little black-haired kunai. He knew
Haku would refuse to face a world alone, with all of his precious
people gone. The boy would likely commit Seppuku(ritual suicide),
just to be done with it.</p><P>He needed the money
though. He almost had enough, just a little more. If he could
finish this job for Gato, he would have enough to move Haku to a
civilian village, someplace they could learn anew, someplace Haku
could settle down and find himself a wife. Someplace he could forget
about the blood covering his hands, and be happy when he looked at
Haku, instead of constantly afraid. Afraid that the boy may die,
leaving him with nothing to live for, nothing worth saving. He
longed for it, deeply, truly.</p><P>Neither expected to be
visited with a knock on the door late in the evening. It was
Zabuza's watch, and Haku sat straight up in bed, shirtless, with
three shuriken ready for launch, should the visitor prove hostile. 
Zabuza checked the peephole, only to find a strange red-head standing
there with a silly grin on his face. (GUESS WHO!!) He looked
strangely familiar, and he just couldn't place it.</p><P>"Who is it,
Zabuza-san?" Haku whispered, unable to understand why his
master was hesitating so. Zabuza motioned for the boy to pretend to
sleep, and opened the door.</p><P>"Hello, you must be
Zabuza-san, formerly of the Mist-swordmen, correct?" The
red-head asked, tone cordial and light. After Zabuza's nod, he spoke
again, "May I come in? I have a business proposition for you."</p><P>This interested Zabuza
highly, and he moved aside to let the proverbial devil into his home.</p><P>End Chapter </p><P>Otaku: I think I ended on
a pretty interesting note, don't you?</p><P>Kyuubi: I wanna ruin the
plot, though.</p><P>Otaku: No!</p><P>Kyuubi: But! But! But!</p><P>Otaku: No! Or else I'll
take away your Naruto-rights for a week!</p><P>Kyuubi: looks terrified
NOT THAT, ANYTHING BUT THAT!!!</p><P>Sasuke: Ha ha!</p><P>See you next time!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P><B>(A/N)</B>
Hey, everyone! I feel so utterly loved! This story has gotten more
recognition than any other story I've written, including Run Away,
the kingdom hearts Yaoi I've been working on for a little over five
months! I'm so proud of my little brain child! AND!! I've gotten
FLAMES!!! YEAH!</p><P>A warning to all flamers: 
I enjoy hearing people criticise my work, and my ideas on life, so
that I can argue it with them. So, go on. Keep sending me flames,
because they'll only make me want to write more. I enjoy messing
with your little minds, and expanding your world, so go on, egg me
on. I enjoy it, and I know you'll have fun with it too.</p><P>Now, for a mini-rant: All
right, I doubt any of you actually know about my personal views on
life. Well, you can summarise it in one word: CHOICE!! I believe
everyone should have a choice as to who they are allowed to marry,
who they are allowed to love, what they are allowed to do. If a man
loves a man, and they want to be married, I believe we should let
them, just because, the heart wants what it wants, and no one can
change that! The same goes for a man and woman, or two women, or two
women and a man, or any other combination of people. I watched an
episode of startrek once, where there was a species in which everyone
had three husbands and/or wives, and everyone was intermarried. I
think that that is a wonderful way to be! I think that if you love
someone, you should be happy with them.</p><P>Now for the part I know
all you flamers(not meaning gays, I kinda like that term for gays
actually, cuz it reminds me of Axel...) are going to be shouting at
me: Well, if we break down all conventional rules what's to stop
pedophiles from marrying little kids, or whats to stop a man from
marrying ten women and then leaving them?!</p><P>Here's the thing: About
the pedophiles, if they truly loved the child that way, they'd wait
until the child grew. They'd wait until that child was old enough to
understand and make their own descision. If they aren't willing to
do that, then they don't truly love the child, and they don't need to
be around that child any longer.</p><P>About the moron marrying a
bunch of women and then leaving them? That's choice hun, and we
can't change that. Those women chose to marry the bastard, and then
he chose to leave. Free will cannot be tampered with, and no matter
what, it will shine through. Those women made a bad choice, and they
must learn to live with the consequences.</p><P>Now, my mini-rant is over.
 I think it turned into an actual rant...oops...Tee hee, oh well. On
with the story!</p><P><B>Kits</B></p><P><B>Pairings:</B>
We've got a full monty here, with a Sasu/Naru/Kyuu/Gaa/Shuu in the
works, and some Kaka/Iruka, Sakura/? (I'd like a vote on who y'all
think Sakura should be paired with, yuri and het are allowed),
Tohru(oc)/Shino (what, the bug-guy deserves some love too!) and some
Zabu/Haku(does this pairing really count as Yaoi? I mean, Haku is a
bishounen(pretty boy) to the extreme!...This is making me wonder...)</p><P><B>Warnings:</B>
 Plotting, Alive!Zabuza-ness, as well as Alive!Haku-ness, and some
real weirdness insuing, so please pay attention...</p><P><B>Description:</B>
Okay, so we're going to have the bridge standoff here, as well as
several key plot-points, so I really want you to pay attention here,
all right?</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B>
 If I owned Naruto, Kyuubi would have a chain around his neck and I
would be petting his head as he sits at my feet. I would be Queen of
all I surveyed, and Naruto would be a very pretty boy who attended
me. (tee hee, a girl can dream...)</p><P><B>Kits Chapter 6 - Where
the Raindrops</B></p><P>Kyuubi sat on the bed,
marvelling at the spartan glamour of the tree-built house. Haku
squirmed a bit, whimpering in his 'sleep', trying to be convincing. 
Kyuubi looked at the boy with a raised eyebrow.</p><P>"Get up, kit, there's
no reason for you not to be protecting your master from me."</p><P>Haku slammed up, flipping
out of the bed as fast as ninja-ly possible, and standing in front of
Zabuza. Kyuubi's eyes widened in surprise. It was the
village-'girl', from earlier that day. That was a surprise, and a
welcome one at that. Naru-chan already liked the 'girl' and
therefore...</p><P>"I'd like to hire
you."</p><P>If Zabuza hadn't been a
trained killer, his jaw would have dropped. He had no idea what this
man was up too, but this couldn't be good.</p><P>"Whatever your
current employer is paying you, I can multiply it by any percentage
you wish. Money is no object." Kyuubi's crimson eyes danced, as
he took in their surprised expressions. The boy was an interesting
specimen, Kyuubi could smell the faint demon blood from here. (from
my understanding, the bloodline limits come from an intermarriage
with a demon, somewhere down the line, and it just gets passed
along.-Otaku)</p><P>"Why?" Zabuza
said, leaning back against the doorjam, trying to look relaxed and
off-gaurd. Kyuubi grinned.</p><P>"I have a pregnant
mate to protect, and you guys were set to kill me earlier. I want
that bridge built, I've put too much sweat and blood into it already.
 On top of that, the whelp of yours needs a good home, and a friend
besides the man who taught him to kill. I've got quite a collection
of my own growing, and I could always use some help. So, what do you
say?"</p><P>Haku glanced in the
direction of Zabuza, wondering what his master would say to this. He
knew that Zabuza needed money, for some unknown reason, he assumed
revenge, but other than that, Zabuza never told him anything. Would
his master take it, and turn his back on Gato? Haku would much
prefer that. He had a bad feeling about fighting for Gato. The man
didn't seem the type to part with money very easily. (yes, Haku has a
woman's intuition!! Tee hee! -Otaku)</p><P>Zabuza looked at the man
before him. He was a red-head obviously, but those crimson
eyes...They weren't natural. They seemed, demonic. Then he noticed
it. The slight taint of demonic Chakra that he had obtained all
those years ago in the academy, was NOTHING compared to what this man
contained. He gently shook at the realization, and the man's smirk
grew wider.</p><P>"Yes, Zabuza, I am
not human. I am a demon, the Kyuubi no Kitsune, that attacked and
nearly destroyed Konoha fourteen years ago." Kyuubi tilted his
head, grinning a fox-grin, "And now, I and my mates are
returning home. You, as I have said, are welcome to come with me, so
long as you serve me. You and your charge will have the protection
of serving the lord of the kitsune's, and you will be able to learn
things Ningen have been dying to get their hands on for millenia. So,
how's it sounding so far?"</p><P>Zabuza looked at Kyuubi
again. He seemed sincere. And obviously desperate. He had revealed
that he had a pregnant mate, which was either weakness on his part,
as it was an easy way to attack what was dearest to him, or he was
absolutely confident in his ability to protect her. Either one was
potentially deadly to Haku and himself. Wait, had the demon said
'Mate<I>s</I>' as in plural? 
This was getting confusing. He was almost drooling at the money,
however. But how would he know if it was real?</p><P>"How do I know you
won't pull a foxes trick once your done with us, and leave us without
even the clothes on our back?" Zabuza demanded, his voice calm.</p><P>"Simple. I am forced
by my very nature to keep a promise I make. Hence the reason you
won't see me promising to save some damn chicken or anything retarded
like that." Kyuubi said, looking slightly miffed. He
apperantly hadn't wanted to give up this tidbit of information. 
Zabuza smiled behind his dark mask.</p><P>"Promise, pay me in
real coins, and you've got yourself some new bodyguards."</p><P>Kyuubi smirked.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Naruto woke up cold. He
was alone, in a futon, and it was dark. He was scared. He had had a
dream again, a dream that started out just like this. Where it was
dark, and cold, and he was alone, and then he wasn't anymore, because
his window had been forced open and he was held down, and he started
whimpering, and he was being touched, and prodded, and cut and hurt. 
He had been ripped open, by the dark shadows with glowing red eyes,
and he didn't want it! He didn't want it.</p><P>He started sobbing,
curling into the futon covers, wide, frightened blue eyes searching
frantically around, looking for any threat. He was alone in the
room, and his sobs grew louder, as he tried to stifle the fear, but
it was huge, it hurt, and he didn't want it! He didn't want it, and
it was coming to get him...</p><P>A noise!</p><P>A door sliding back, his
door, to the room he was in sliding open, someone was coming in! NO!
It was going to happen again. He laid still, fear silencing his
sobs, and he waited, fear overriding any of his training, he was so
scared. There was a shadow, a shadow just like in his dream, moving
towards him, it was coming for him. He sobbed again, trying to stay
silent, but he was so afraid, so afraid.</p><P>The shadow was by his bed
now, it was reaching down, it was going to hurt him!!</p><P>"NO!!" Naruto
screamed, launching himself on the shadow, attacking with everything
he had, clawing, biting, kicking, pleading and screaming. The shadow
fought back, pinning him to the ground, and he fought, screaming and
crying. The black shadow above him leaned down, he knew it, he knew
it was going to happen again!</p><P>He struggled, harder than
ever, turning his head away from it, turning away from the awful
creature trying to break him, consume him, tear him apart again.</p><P>"Dobe, shhh, shhh,
it's alright, I'm here, shhh, you're safe now." The voice was
calm, soothing, Sasuke's voice, but Sasuke wasn't here, he was at
that damned mansion, all alone, just like him, he wasn't here, this
thing was trying to trick him! But still...</p><P>"Sasuke?" The
former-blonde whimpered, still sobbing.</p><P>"That's right, dobe,
I'm right here, nothing's going to hurt you." The kind words
melted the fear, his heart stopped clenching, started beating again,
not quivvering inside his chest.</p><P>"I was all alone, and
it was so dark, and I was so scared, Sasuke, so scared!" He
sobbed, clutching onto the no-longer pinnning him Sasuke. The
dark-haried avenger growled a bit, rubbing circles on the blonde's
back. This was what the brave, courageous blonde had been reduced
too, all by those morons stupidity. How he loathed his village right
now. This was not what the adorable blonde deserved.</p><P>"You're alright now,
you don't have to be afraid, Kyuubi and I will protect you, there's
no one here who'll hurt you." He kept whispering these things
to the dobe, but he kept denying them.</p><P>"Konoha hates me,
they'll do anything to hurt me, Sasuke, anything, we have to get
away!" He whimpered into Sasuke's shirt. Sasuke lifted the
tear-stained face in both hands, onyx eyes gazing into those bright
blue orbs, and spoke, calmly, gently.</p><P>"Naruto, we are away
from Konoha. We're not there any more, we're in the Mist.You are
safe, and Kyuubi will make sure you STAY that way." He smiled
down at the quivvering jinchurikii, hoping to see that smile again,
the smile he had longed for while he was trapped in Konohagakure,
awaiting this very mission.</p><P>"I'm...I'm safe. 
THey can't get me. Right? They can't get me, right?" Naruto
said, looking hopefully at Sasuke. The black-eyed avenger smiled, a
rare sight, and nodded. The beauty in his arms smiled a wide, happy
smile, and clutched to him again</p><P>"Why are you holding
Naru-chan?" A confused voice called from the doorway. Naruto
froze in Sasuke's arms, and Sasuke nearly cursed. All his work in
calming the blonde might be for nothing now. He turned to face the
interloper, finding a shock of turqoise hair, and bright, inquisitive
green eyes were looking at them strangely. Tohru had been awoken by
the screams of the earstwhile Naru-chan.</p><P>"I-I had a nightmare,
and my husband isn't here, and Sasuke-san was trying to comfort me."
 'She' moved away from the black-haired boy, smiling her fake, happy
smile at the blunette. "Everythings alright now, though, so you
all can go back to bed. I'm sure my husband will return from where
ever he went soon enough."</p><P>Sasuke frowned, but
nodded, moving to leave. Naruto watched as his Avenger left with the
blunette, and he tried desperately to lay back down and sleep. All
he could do was lay there, and stare at the moonlight shining on the
paper-door.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Tohru was no longer
suspicious. He was sure. There was something going on between
Naru-chan and Sasuke-kun. And he was going to find out what was
going on.</p><P>They were walking down the
hallway that led to their room, the one that was open to the garden,
because it had been such a nice night. Tohru completely missed the
flash of red fur, as he pinned Sasuke to a wall with a suspicious
stare.</p><P>"What the fuck,
Tohru!?" Sasuke growled.</p><P>"What is going on,
Sasuke-kun, and don't lie to me." Tohru said, in a calm voice
that the children in his class at the academy had learned to fear. 
Tohru had made it to top of his class for his ability to shut off any
and all emotions, and when he did, he was cold, ruthless and
efficient.</p><P>"There's nothing
going on, Tohru!" Sasuke whispered feircely. He was abruptly
slammed into the wall again, causing him to hiss in pain, as that
cold-faced blunette looked him in the eyes again.</p><P>"I said don't lie to
me, Sasuke-kun. There is something between you and Naru-chan. What
is it? Where do you know her from?!" Tohru's voice was strange,
a mixture of calm and fury, almost as if two people were speaking at
once.</p><P>"I-I can't tell you!
It'd put him in danger!" Sasuke choked out, his hands clutching
at the deathgrip the other boy had on his shirt.</p><P>"'Him'? I had sensed
a Henge, but I didn't expect a full sex-change. The only one to ever
successfully complete a henge that had that kind of effect was
Uzumaki Naruto, the missing nin from Konoha." Tohru's eyes
narrowed. This was certainly an unexpected revalation.</p><P>"Naru-chan is
Naruto-san, isn't he?" Tohru said, a calm smile on his face. 
Sasuke growled, narrowing his own eyes. He had no choice, he
couldn't breath any longer, the other boy was holding his throat
closed, he nodded.</p><P>"Alright, you are
going to explain everything to me, Sasuke-kun, and then I'm going to
decide what I should do with our little missing-nin." the cruel
ninja released him, causing him to fall to the floor, coughing and
sputtering.</p><P>Sasuke only nodded, trying
to get his breath back, as Tohru grilled him for the information. He
answered truthfully, still a little unsure what this psychopath had
planned. The boy was almost like a second Itachi. He had been calm
one minute and psychotic the next. It seriously freaked the Uchiha
out.</p><P>Once the explanation was
done, Tohru nodded, speaking.</p><P>"Alright, I
understand. Now, listen here, Sasuke-kun. I'm going to help you,
because I know for a fact that the villagers CAN be that cruel."
 Tohru looked forlorn and a little distubed, but he continued, "But,
in return, you have to convince Kyuubi-sama to take me with you. I
want power, and he can give it to me. So, we have a deal?" 
Tohru's eyes glinted in a strange light, and Sasuke was beginning to
wonder if perhaps this boy was just a little too crazy to be trained
as a Ninja.</p><P>"Fine, but Kyuubi
makes all the final descisions. After all, it's his place we're
going to." Sasuke whispered, standing to go back to bed. Tohru
nodded, following. The two settled back into their futons, slipping
into sleep quickly, never noticing that after a few hours, Kakashi
sat up, and muttered, "So, that's how it is..."</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Kyuubi returned to an
awake, shivvering, hiccuping Naruto, and immediately realised what
had happened. He cooed to the boy, pulling him into his arms,
hugging him. The nightmares that Kyuubi had been hiding from the boy
must have slipped through while he was preoccupied with the Zabuza
thing. He had let Naruto down. Naruto buried his head into Kyuubi's
chest, feeling week and useless.</p><P>"Naru-chan, you know
you are useful to me. I need you, I couldn't live without you, so
don't you even think like that, okay?" Naruto nodded, sighing. 
Kyuubi continued to speak, but whispered it into the boy's ear, that
way they wouldn't be overheard. "Tommorrow, there is going to
be an attack on the bridge. Before you leave here, be sure to tell
Inari and Tsunami goodbye. You will see them again, when it is safe,
but until then, it is goodbye. Then you will come to the bridge, and
we will 'fight' with Zabuza and Haku. They are good fighters, and
wise Ninja. We're going to take them with us to the hidden village.
Alright?" Another sleepy nod, and Kyuubi placed a tender kiss
in the mop of brown hair.</p><P>"Go to sleep little
one, and all will be well in the morning." Naruto slipped into
sleep, and as soon as Kyuubi was sure he was deep in the realm of
dreams, pleasant ones, of ramen and babies, he slipped away from the
pretty former-blonde. Opening the sliding door that was essentially
a patio, he stepped outside. Taking one last look at the little male
sleeping in the futon, he turned to the moon, and muttering some
growling syllables, he slit his thumb open on his increasingly sharp
canines. Letting the blood pool and drop onto the dew-splattered
earth, he waited.</p><P>He did not wait long
however. Slinking out of the shadows and the brush, came three
shapes, three blurs of fur and teeth. They stopped before him, and
bowed, low and humbly. These were Kitsune, each of three tails or
more. He growled, and they snapped their heads up.</p><P>"<B>In
two days time, I will arrive in my city. Prepare my chambers, for I
bear with me a pregnant mate, a second mate, and a group of three
ningens. They are my honored guests and servants, no harm is to
befall them. Now go, and let it be known that Kyuubi no Kitsune
comes home in two cycles of the sun."</B></p><P>The foxes yipped softly
and ran off, leaving a grinning Kyuubi behind. All was in place now,
and nothing could go wrong.</p><P>He returned to his little
mate, snuggling around him, his henge'd tails curling around the two,
and he fell asleep, peaceful, and proud that his precious mates would
soon be safe.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>The fateful day arrived,
the sun peaking in on Tazuna getting ready to go, and Kyuubi leaving
his sleeping mate to resume his disguise as Kyuuto the
bridge-builder's apprentice. The four ninja awoke, getting ready to
accompany Tazuna and Kyuuto to the bridge, two newly enlightened on
the situation, and one still clueless. Naruto and Tsubasa-kun slept
peacefully unaware, while Inari helped his mother cook breakfast.</p><P>The bridge-bound group
headed off, and a few hours later, a groggy, confused Naru-chan
awoke. As always her first instinct was to put a hand to her womb,
checking to make sure it was real, alive, and still with her. It was
and she sighed a sigh of relief. Then, she dressed, going out to
enjoy breakfast, and then going out for her 'walk', with Tsubasa-kun.
 Naruto knew something had gone wrong, when he found a mutilated
pig-corpse in the woods. He raced back, just in time to save Inari
with a Kawarimi no Jutsu (Art of substitution), and knock out two
potential kidnappers.</p><P>"What's going on?!"
Tsunami screeched, clutching Inari to her.</p><P>"I don't know, but I
assume this is Gato's doing. I have to go warn the others. Go get
help from the villagers, they should be able to provide some backup!"
Naruto called, racing off towards the bridge. He hoped he'd make it
in time, hoped nothing had gone wrong and he was just paranoid.</p><P>But as soon as he arrived
on the bridge he knew he was wrong. Sasuke and Tohru were trapped in
a huge feild of Ice-Mirrors, with Haku pelting him with Senbon
(little metal needle thingys). Sakura was covering Tazuna, protecting
him from something, but he couldn't see what. He also couldn't see
Kakashi or Zabuza, because the fog was rising. This wasn't good, and
WHERE THE FUCK WAS KYUUBI?! Knocked out, apperantly, atleast, that's
what it looked like with him laying off to the side of the bridge.</p><P><B>I'm fine kit, but this
was necessary to keep their attention off of me. Don't worry.</B></p><P>Naruto breathed a mental
sigh of relief, and, letting go of the Henge, prepared to fight. 
Slipping into the Ice-mirrors, he surprised Haku, who didn't know who
he was. Haku settled on throwing Senbon at this newcomer, dodging to
the next mirror, watching as most of the senbon was deflected.</p><P>"Dobe, what the
hell!? We had a chance as long as you were OUTSIDE!" Sasuke
growled, cursing his blonde's stupidity.</p><P>"Hey, first fight in
a little over two months, ok? 'Scuse me for being rusty!"
Naruto huffed. Haku actually stood there in the mirror, and behind
his mask had a face on like, 'what the hell?!' Then he showered them
with Senbon needles again, out of pure frustration.</p><P>Meanwhile, Kakashi was
having a tough time in his fight against Zabuza. He was worried
though, because, now that Naruto had shown up, Kyuubi would probably
awaken from his 'faint', and they'd all be dead.</p><P>He pulled out a scroll,
and zipped a slit thumb across it, searing blood into the seal within
it, summoning his dogs to hold Zabuza in place. This would end it.</p><P>Or so he thought, however,
at that exact moment, Haku scored on Sasuke with a dozen senbon all
precisely aimed to simulate death. The dark-haired boy collapsed in
Naruto's lap after protecting the blonde. Tohru went into his
cold-state, as his teachers had called it, watching the dark-haired
Ice-master's movements. Naruto, in a rage, a turmoil of loss and
pain, called upon Kyuubi's chakra, creating aswirling vortex of the
red-flame substance. He proceeded to pummel the living hell out of
the now-near-defenseless Haku.</p><P>Tohru, meanwhile, was
analysing Sasuke's injuries, and, being a Senbon-user himself,
noticed that it was only a death-like state. He quickly pulled the
black-haired boy out of it, while the normally-sunny blonde beat the
holy shit out of Haku. He moved Sasuke closer to where Kyuubi was,
watching as the red-head awoke to a state of absolute alert, the
minute Naruto tapped into the chakra.</p><P>Kakashi was about to
deliver the final blow, as the kyuubi chakra diminished a bit,
suddenly, to find, his blow hadn't touched Zabuza. Instead, he had
just ripped the heart out of a gently smiling black-haired boy-child.
 Kakashi's eyes widened, as Haku fell, still smiling gently.</p><P>Zabuza was utterly lost. 
He had just lost the dearest thing he had. He had just lost his only
reason for living.</p><P>"Well, well, what do
we have here?" Gato's voice rang out through the clearing mist.
 Behind him stood a large group of thugs, all looking for a fight. 
While the adults were preoccupied with talking to the idiot Gato,
Tohru pulled Haku's 'corpse' over to Kyuubi. The red-head quickly
placed him into a coma-like suspended animation.</p><P>"That should save him
until we get to the village." Kyuubi said, holding up Naruto,
who was near exhausted, stamina freak that he was, due to the strain
of the child.</p><P>Zabuza was about to attack
Gato, when an arrow fired by, none other than Inari, stopped everyone
in their tracks, and Kyuubi decided that THEN was the time. He
stepped in front of the group of villagers, turning to Gato, and
grinned, as his face, slowly, surely, turned into that of a giant
fox. Bones crunched, shifted, tails appeared, and his eyes stained a
yellow with crimson iris.</p><P>Before them all, stood the
great Kyuubi no Kitsune, and the thugs ran.</p><P>The giant fox turned
towards Kakashi, who was still trying to figure out what to do. 
Attacking would be kinda stupid, and running could get him killed, or
worse, his students. The fox chuckled.</p><P>"<B>Do
not worry, Kakashi, I will not harm your students, nor the villagers
who have been kind to Naruto and I. However, I have a message for
you and Sakura to deliver. Tell your Hokage, 'Find the reason for
our departure in the foundation of your village. We will return for
the chuunin exams, and Naruto will be healed.'"</B></p><P>Kakashi nodded, as the
giant fox lay down on the bridge. Kakashi was surprised as Tohru
helped gather Sasuke, and Zabuza pushed Haku aboard the fox demon. 
Naruto stood infront of the red-furred creature, the green-eyed child
on his hip. The blonde turned soft eyes on the two, the pink-haired
kunoichi, and the silver-haired teacher-nin.</p><P>"You know, I don't
blame Konoha. I never did. I thank them, actually, because now I
have a chance at a family of my own." Here, his hand strayed to
his stomach again, in a gesture Kakashi remembered, and now, his eyes
widened at what it meant. "I really never understood why they
did all that to me, but...well, I'm going to have some trouble
trusting anyone, now. I mean, that's what happens when you're
attacked in your own home. Maybe...Maybe after the child's born,
I'll bring it to the village to see where it SHOULD have grown up."</p><P>With that, the blonde got
on the giant creatures back, and bounded away.</p><P>End Chapter </p><P>Otaku: Wow! I hardly
believe I wrote that! Ah!</p><P>Naruto: Wow...I've really
become emotional...surprised stare</p><P>Otaku: Well, Naruto,
that's because, though you have support, and you seem okay, no one is
ever "fine" after a rape. It seriously messes with a
person's head to be used that way, and it messes with their
perception, as well. There's likely to be more of those kind of
scenes later on too, becuase I am trying to make this as realistic as
possible.</p><P>Kyuubi: But don't worry,
Naru-chan!! We're here to help you!</p><P>Sasuke: That's right!</p><P>Otaku: Now, Stay tuned
for the next chapter, mkay?</p><P>See you next time!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
Hey, everybody. I should warn you, I was in an angsty mood while
writing this, so it'll probably have quite a bit of angst going on. 
Other than that, sit back and enjoy!</p><P><B>Kits</B></p><P><B>Pairings:</B>
 In this chapter, I intend to illustrate the relationship between
Kakashi and Iruka a little more, as well as delve into the
relationship between Sasuke and Kyuubi. Also, I hope to set up some
groundwork for the Tohru/Shino thing. Other than that, if a couple
shows up, thats them, guys.</p><P><B>Warnings:
</B></p><P><B>Description:
</B> Naruto and co. arrive in
the Kitsunegakure! Their adventures there will decide the fate of
many! Also, Kakashi and Sakura report back, and the village reacts!</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B>
 Y'know this thing is really annoying...If I owned Naruto, I wouldn't
have to bother with one of these.</p><P><B>Kits
Chap. 7 Where the Raindrops, as They're Falling, Tell a Story</B></p><P>Kyuubi
ran for two days solid. He ran through the forests, the hills, the
dense mountains, taking routes that hadn't seen humans in a very long
time. He ran as fast as he could, pacing himself, so that he could
get his charges to a safe place.</p><P>During
those two days, everything was explained to everyone, and bonds were
formed. Haku took an instant liking to little Tsubasa, and decided
to teach him how to use senbon (metal needles), and Tohru offered to
help.</p><P>Tohru
started recording his adventures on a scroll, telling the story of
how he became a retainer for a demon-lord and a pregnant, blonde
Jinchuriiki. He rather liked this group, actually. They weren't
stuck up, most were down to earth, and quite jovial. As he watched,
it was like a family coming together.</p><P>Sasuke
seemed to be a central part in it, and on Kyuubi's great red-furred
back, it was to Sasuke that Naruto clung, laughing, joking, prodding,
arguing, and just generally enjoying the ravens presence. This made
Tohru smile, because he saw Sasuke smile that elusive grin more and
more. It was like watching one made of ice melt to reveal real, warm
flesh beneath.</p><P>Zabuza
felt the same way, only about his Haku, instead. The boy was
smiling, more alert, happier than Zabuza had ever seen him. He
positively glowed with joy, and it brought joy to Zabuza's heart as
well. This was what he had wanted for the boy, a good home, a family
who wouldn't hesitate to protect him. He had never dreamed that he
might be a part of it. It was more than his wildest dreams had ever
hoped.</p><P>The
days were spent easily, sitting astride the great-beasts back,
playing with the cards that Zabuza had had in one of his pouches (he
often gets bored, and will play two-man solitaire with Haku -Otaku)
with everyone talking and laughing.</p><P>And
on the second night, Kyuubi stopped. He laid down, in a rather large
feild, full of night-blooming flowers, with the great full moon over
head. Everyone took this as a cue to get off, and stretch their legs
a bit.</p><P>After
the last had slid off of his back, Kyuubi turned back to his ningen
form, and lay there in the grass, dazed a bit, watching the stars
twinkle.</p><P>Tohru
immediately took charge, as Sasuke and Naruto went to sit by the
exhausted fox.</p><P>"Alright,
Zabuza-san, would you mind doing a perimeter sweep, while Haku and I
set up some makeshift tents? And Tsubasa-kun, could you start a
fire, a SMALL fire, for us?" The black-haired man nodded curtly
then dissapeared, and the little fox beamed up at him.</p><P>"Hai(yes),.
Tohru-san!"</p><P>He
smiled at the child, and he went off to start a little campfire. He
was amazed how much like regular children demonic ones were. He had
expected something...stranger. The boy was almost perfectly normal,
minus the red-fox ears on his head and the two bushy tails coming
from his behind, and his adoration of his 'Naruto-sama'</p><P>Tohru
began to set up the tents with Haku, while Naruto and Sasuke were
trying to coax Kyuubi out of his dead-tired state.</p><P>"Kyuubi,
you gotta talk to us here. You can't just pass out, you gotta cool
down, and you gotta eat something!" Naruto said, trying to
sound commanding. It didn't really work...Sasuke snickered at the
feeble attempt the blonde made.</p><P>"Look,
Kyuubi, you're the mission leader here, so you gotta tell us what's
going on. How far are we from your village? What should we expect? 
Are there any strange customs we should abserve? You still have to
give up this information, if we are going to successfully survive in
your world." Sasuke informed him, sounding quite bored with it,
though still snickering.</p><P>The
red-head sat up, Naruto supporting him. He sighed heavily, resting
against Naruto's hands, and blinked sleep away. Then he realised
what was wrong. He had forgotten to give his clone body more chakra,
which was why it was feeling fatigue. It was at the point of
'poof'ing out, and he ran some more of his brilliant red-chakra
through it, feeling instantly better. He grinned up at Sasuke and
Naruto, jumping up, and pulling the two up with him.</p><P>They
went over to their newly formed camp, finding Haku, Tohru and Tsubasa
sitting in the center, with a nice warm fire going. However Zabuza
was absent, still on his patrol.</p><P>"Alright,
what I have to say is going to be required of all of you, so, I'll
wait to say it until I WON'T have to repeat myself. Until then, I
suggest you all wait for me to get back from hunting down our
dinner." The red-head then pecked first Naruto then Sasuke on
the cheek, leaving both blushing, and ran off into the forest.</p><P>"What
was that about?!" Naruto asked, sounding slightly pissed. 
Sasuke just grumbled silently, but everyone picked up the words
'kill', 'skin', and 'fox-fur' in there somewhere...</p><P>A
few minutes later, Zabuza came back, finding Haku waiting for him
with a warm smile, and a 'welcome back' like always. This time, it
caused Zabuza to blush behind his mask, however. He sat down next to
the feminine boy, and questioned himself mentally, until Kyuubi
arrived sporting a giant deer carcass. His grin spoke volumes, as
the little fox-boy attacked the meat, tearing off a bleeding chunk of
it, right in front of the humans.</p><P>Tohru
lost his lunch, right there.</p><P>Naruto
was used to it, and Sasuke was looking a little green around the
gills. Haku had joined Tohru in his missing lunch, and Zabuza was
staring at the child curiously. It seemed almost as if he was
remembering the taste, himself.</p><P>Meanwhile,
Kyuubi tore a leg off and started chewing on it, blood splattering
everywhere.</p><P>"Make
sure you eat the heart, Bozu (Brat). It's good for you." He
offered the tiny red-head advice, and the little boy beamed, looking
like he had just been given a christmas present. Naruto shook his
head, portioning out the rest of the meat to be cooked for the
ningens consumption. "Now, I suppose I should explain a little
bit about the village, huh?"</p><P>Everyone
(who wasn't currently losing their lunch.) turned to look at the
fox-demon, expectantly. Even Tohru cut off his gagging to pay
attention, while Haku really did try, but he had a delicate
constitution to begin with...</p><P>"It's
very simple. We Kitsune have been around for thousands upon
thousands of years. Most of that time, we spend doing nothing more
than increasing our abilities. The village of Kitsune, or
Kitsunegakure, is a place where our royalty and nobility go to train
themselves, to enjoy themselves, and to replenish their humanity,
amongst our brethren.</p><P>"The
literal translation, Hidden in Foxes, is a metaphor, for the basic
fact that all Kitsune hold it as home, a sanctuary in time of need. 
In fact, you ningens copied our naming technique with your villages. 
Every demonic race has this kind of place, some in the air, others
underwater, but we Kitsune chose the forests, deep and untouchable,
for we keep it that way."</p><P>Everyone
was paying rapt attention to Kyuubi, listening to his deep voice, as
it gave them information.</p><P>"In
the Kitsune village, your status is equal to the number of tails you
have. Ones, twos, threes, are like common peasants, or Genin, while
fours, fives, and sixes are considered nobles. Sevens are considered
representatives of our race, as they are usually more peaceful, while
eights are nearly gone, for they are usually bloodthirsty, and
totally uncontrollable. There is only one Nine-tails at any point in
time. They are the king, god, ruler over all Kitsune, and they're
word is absolute law. The thing is, they combine the two aspects of
the seven and eight tailed, being both representatives of our race,
and violent to a fault. I admit, I have quite the temper."</p><P>Naruto
nodded his blonde head, attesting to the red-heads temper, causing
the group to laugh.</p><P>"In
Kitsune society, we take mates, and those mates are held sacred by
us. Only with our mates permission may we take a second, third or so
on, mate. Once we take a mate, they are ours for life, as are we
theirs. So, be wise, should someone offer mating to you, it is a
lifetime thing, not just a fling. If they offer to sleep with you,
that's just a fling, go for it."</p><P>Again
everyone paused to laugh at the joke the kitsune had slipped in.</p><P>"Now,
onto the serious stuff. You, Haku, Zabuza, Tohru, you are all to be
gaurds in my household, retainers, if you will. I trust you, because
Naruto trusts you, and therefore, you will be treated with respect
and luxury in my home. Same goes for you, Gaki, but you're going to
have a tougher time of it. You all must train hard, and keep up your
strength.</p><P>"Manners
go as follows:</p><P>One,
someone above your rank growls, you bare your throat, just like a
dog. It'll calm them down, and you'll look better.</p><P>Two,
you are a minority, so DON'T act superior, even if you are stronger
than a demons human form. Remember, we foxes have a long memory and
even longer lives.</p><P>Three,
do not reveal anything you learn there to anyone. You never know who
has secrets from who in a kitsune village, we're all tricksters and
theives.</p><P>Alright,
got it? Feel free to ask me questions at any point in time. Oh, and
in the village, you must adress me as Kyuubi-dono, understand?"</p><P>Everyone
nodded, and dinner commenced, with little conversation. Everyone had
important things to think about. Kyuubi was steeling himself up for
what he knew would be coming soon...</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITKSITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Kyuubi
pulled Sasuke and Naruto out into the forest, for some 'scouting'. 
He fidgeted nervously as he led them away from the camp. Damn, why
was he so nervous! It wasn't like they would say no...Well, Sasuke
might, just to be a bastard, but that wasn't the point. He still had
to...</p><P>"Oi,
Kyuubi, why are you dragging us into the middle of the forest, in the
middle of the night?" Sasuke grumbled, looking cross.</p><P>Kyuubi
stopped, in a small clearing surrounded by trees. There was a log in
the middle of the brush, a good sitting spot, and he perched on it,
staring at the moon. He was trying to get his nerve up.</p><P>"Kyuu-chan,
come on, I gotta get some sleep tonight..." Naruto whined. His
blue eyes looked worried, and he was wondering what was up with the
red-head, wondering what could have made him this skittish.</p><P>"Naruto,
Sasuke, you remember...You remember what I said about Mates, right?"
 Both boys nodded. "Well, I told my messangers that I was
coming home with mates. In plural. On top of that, well, oh dammit!"</p><P>The
ages old fox ran a hand through his crimson hair, looking
disconcerted. Sasuke's eyes widened a trifle, as he realised, and
then he smirked.</p><P>"You
want us to be your mates, but you're too nervous to ask."</p><P>The
statement brought wide crimson eyes to land on the boy, and the fox
was positively shaking.</p><P>Naruto
smiled softly, looking at the scared fox. He knew how much it took
for Kyuubi to ask. He still remembered the vague glimpses of the
memories the demon carried with him, of a vixen screaming as she
died, of kits being rended by another male. He knew the heartache
that had caused Kyuubi, and Kyuubi's solemn belief that he would
never find one worthy of being his mate again.</p><P>"Kyuubi,
if you will have me, I will be your mate. You would be a better
father than just about anyone I've ever met, and you treat me a lot
better than most people I know. You already know I love you, and I
know you love me, so, that's all there is to it. You're stuck with
me." The blonde ended forcefully.</p><P>Sasuke
smirked, "Well, Kyuubi, if you wanted me for a mate, you only
had to ask, you know. It is definately in my interest to consolidate
the power of my clan with that of a demon, especially one as powerful
as you. Plus, I get Naruto as a package deal, so I accept."</p><P>Kyuubi
was totally blown away. The two most beautiful, strongest ningens he
had ever met, were agreeing to be his mates! He was...exstatic! He
jumped up, laughing a loud, boisterous laugh, gathering his two mates
into his arms, and dancing insanely around the clearing, filling it
with the laughter of the three.</p><P>They
were deliriously happy, a warmth filling Sasuke that he hadn't
experienced since Itachi took everything from him. He had family,
now. Family that wouldn't run away, that wouldn't die on him. 
Because is one died, the other did, and they refused to leave him all
alone in the world.</p><P>"So,
I guess we're officially a couple, or rather, a threesome, now
right?" Naruto giggled a few minutes later, when Kyuubi had
collapsed to the ground, Naruto and Sasuke pulled tightly to his
sides. He snuggled into Kyuubi's warm arms, and noticed, subtly, the
raven-haired avenger doing the same.</p><P>"I
suppose so, Dobe." The sharingan succesor sighed. Naruto
noticed the quiet happiness filling the avenger, and smiled
brilliantly at it, while Kyuubi just grinned at the world in general.</p><P>"Y'know,
this means I have to mark you two."</p><P>They
looked at him like he was a freak, each picturing the kind of
'marking' Akamaru had done in the academy. Kyuubi burst out
laughing again at the mental image Naruto was sending him.</p><P>"N-no!
NO, I won't mark you like THAT!! Jeeze...I'm not some mutt, y'know."
 He said, his laughter tapering off to giggles. "In a demon,
well, marking ceremony, the mates bite each other on the pulse point,
leaving permanent scars, while molding the two's Yokai, or chakra,
together. But, with you two, neither of you would be able to
properly mark me, so we'll have to come up with something for your
versions of the ceremony."</p><P>Sasuke
looked thoughtful for a few moments, and then was surprised when
Naruto beat him to the punch.</p><P>"Earrings."
 The blonde declared. When his two companions looked at him
curiously, he elaborated, "Earrings, their cheap, inexpensive
and they will be a permanent mark on you, Kyuubi. Sasuke and I can
peirce you with one earring each." Kyuubi nodded, liking the
idea. Simple, effective, and quite enticing, actually.</p><P>"So
that's all settled, we should probably go to bed for a while. It's
going to be rough acclimating to a new society." Sasuke said,
holding back a yawn. The other two nodded, and slowly got up, going
back to camp.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Sakura
was quiet on their way back, mostly becuase her sensei still hadn't
spoken a word since the bridge. The silver haired jounin had been
mulling things over all night, and the two days since. She still
remembered the harsh explanation she had had to give to Tazuna and
the others.</p><P>Basically
she had told them that Naruto was a missing nin, and he was wanted
back home, and now that Sasuke and Tohru had gone with him, they
would be missing nin as well. They had told her that they were glad.
 Naru-chan, as they had known Naruto, was a sweet child, male or not,
and a kind person. Kyuuto, who turned out to be the demon Kyuubi,
had helped them a lot during the two's time there. They were
thankful for the angels who were brought to them through Konoha's
stupidity.</p><P>Sakura
had flinched at that. She, too, along with all the children in the
academy, had followed their parents example, and been cruel to the
blonde boy. She had always thought he was a moron, someone not
worthy of her friendship. After all, he was a brat who knew nothing
of what a real family was like, the yelling, the hurt, the crying
when someone dies. He would never have to have that problem.</p><P>Atleast,
that's what she had thought.</p><P>"Sensei,
when Naruto said..." Sakura looked to her teacher for some
guidance, and he turned a single black eye to her, looking a little
disturbed.</p><P>"Yes,
Sakura. He was right. I'm not sure how, but somehow, Naruto is
pregnant. I saw signs earlier, but didn't think anything of it,
because Naruto was male, but perhaps I overlooked something."</p><P>"Then,
that demon-" Kakashi nodded, letting her know his thoughts.</p><P>"I
beleive so, which might explain a bit about Naruto's condition. We
know little to nothing of demons, and they like to keep it that way."</p><P>They
spoke little until they got to the gates after that. Sakura was
mostly worried about her Sasuke. What had Naruto done to entice him
into leaving the village? She had heard the stories about
fox-demons, seducing men, stealing, lying to get whatever they
wanted. She was sure that Naruto had somehow fooled Sasuke into
coming with him.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Naruto
marvelled at the oppulence of the city. The buildings were sculpted,
half in, and half out of the giant trees, all the people were in
beautiful clothes, and most looked like walking foxes in clothes. 
They were beautiful, and everyone was gasping over them. The light,
filtering through the leaves above them, threw an emerald glow over
everything.</p><P>It
was like walking into a story book, the trees were huge, and the
people were kind, smiling, and laughing, greeting them happily. 
Naruto was greeted with everyone calling out, and throwing flowers
over them as they went along the way to Kyuubi's home. Little ones
ran in and out of the party, giving the group things, like frogs, and
flowers, and some even ryos.</p><P>But
what was most spectacular was the greeting Kyuubi recieved.</p><P>It
was as if some long dead god had come back to them and they wept with
joy. Females dragged kits in front of him, asking him to bless them,
and with a benevolent smile, he did. Males began chanting an old
song, something that soothed and calmed the spirit, making the
encounter seem even more of a fairy tale.</p><P>It
seemed as if they had been wading in a dream by the time they arrived
at the palace, once again half in and half out of the tree. It was
positively huge, at least as big as Hokage mountain, and they all
gasped again, minus Zabuza of course, at the sheer beauty of the
place.</p><P>Inside,
servants were scrambling around, getting into places, just like in an
old japanese mansion. They formed two lines, one on either side of
the great double doors they entered, and immediately called out, the
minute Kyuubi set foot inside.</p><P>"Welcome
home, Master!" It was a joyous sound, as if they had waited
centuries to say it again.</p><P>Kyuubi
smiled as soft smile, and looking around with joy in his eyes, said,
"I'm home."</p><P>And
everyone cheered.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>"What,
no welcome home?" Kakashi joked, smiling at the hokage, who, at
the moment was fuming.</p><P>Kakashi
had returned, from a successful mission, missing TWO genin. Not just
that, but in his mission report, he said that the Kyuubi had
reappeared!</p><P>"Kakashi,
what is the meaning of this report." He said, holding up the
offending document.</p><P>"It's
quite simple, Hokage-sama. That report is the exact events that
happened while we were on the mission. As it states in there, I came
back minus two genin, becuase the Kyuubi enticed them, and they fled
with it." The silver-haired jounin had lost all jovialness and
was talking seriously.</p><P>"That's
not possible, unless the seal on Naruto broke." The hokage
said, turning his eyes from Kakashi to the documents on his desk. 
One of them was the entirety of the file they had on one, Uzumaki
Naruto.</p><P>"Well,
I don't know about that, but I did see the Kyuubi with my own eyes. 
It wasn't a genjutsu, it had it's own chakra system. And on top of
that, if you read the report all the way through..."</p><P>"Yes,
yes, I noticed that part. I believe in that, atleast, the boy was
lying. A male cannot conceive."</p><P>"And
you know this for certain?" A voice asked, softly, from the
corner.</p><P>The
two spun, weapons in hand, as the new threat showed itself.</p><P>A
smirking woman, arms crossed in front of her, her deep red hair
falling around her in waves. Her green eyes flashed with a fury,
barely contained. Her green chinese-kimono was deeply slitted, her
legs shown in all their glory. Her breasts bounced healthily, but,
above all, her two tails waved behind her, flashes of angry red and
white.</p><P>"I
can tell you all you need to know about the damnable blonde, and his
pet fox. Including what you seem to overlook."</p><P>Sarutobi
was immediately suspicious. This woman wasn't human, and she appeared
mightily angry.</p><P>"Why?
Why would you turn on your own kind, just to inform us about their
secrets?" A guess by the silver-haried jounin, and it hit the
mark. Her red-painted lips widened into a painful grin, and she
radiated fury.</p><P>"Because
that BITCH stole my pup and left me to die. Now, I want revenge."</p><P><B> End

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
This is actually the second time I've written this chapter. Stupid
computer! Tricking me with stupid popups...Anyway, the first chapter
was really awesome, but I had to make due with this one instead. 
Also, I've gotten some complaints about me forgetting Tsubasa, and I
understand. Sometimes I do forget about him, but don't worry, he is a
very quiet child, and usually hangs around Naruto. And also, on the
subject of Tohru, don't worry bout him, neither, he's just the means
to an end. After all, Shino deserves some lovin' and I didn't want
to pair him with one of the canon Naruto characters. So...On with
the show!!</p><P><B>Kits!</B></p><P><B>Pairings:
</B>SasuNaru (in the form of a
worried Sasuke), a bit of KyuuNaru, and a bit of KakaIruka kissing!
Tee hee, they're so cute together!</p><P><B>Warnings:
 </B>Yaoi! also, a magical
fountain warning, ahead of time, and just a tad bit of over
describing rooms (I fell in love with the picture of the rooms I got
in my head, so I had to explain it to everyone...-Otaku) Just a tad
bit of freaky hitting-on-Haku by an OC, but that won't affect much.</p><P><B>Description:
</B> Kyuubi gets hassled by an
old friend, the boys get settled into their new home, and Tohru gets
a sad reminder of his past, while Iruka and Kakashi reschedule a date
thanks to Kakashi's houseguest.</p><P><B>Disclaimer:</B>
 If I owned Naruto, you would see a whole lot more of Kyuubi!Naruto,
because I positively adore the giant whisker marks on his face. So,
obviously, I don't own Naruto.</p><P><B>Kits!
Chapter 8 In My Feild of Paper Flowers</B></p><P>Kyuubi
sighed contentedly, as he sat behind the huge mahogany desk. He was
very glad to be home, even with all the bad memories lingering all
over the place. He did however, glower at the huge stacks of
paperwork filling up the sides of his desk.</p><P>Ah,
the hells of being a ruler.</p><P>But,
before he could even get started on the paper-towers-of-doom, a loud
knock sounded on the door. He called for the intruder to enter, and
lo and behold, it was one of the seven-tails.</p><P>She
had long red-brown hair, white tips, and ample curves. (In other
words, she'd be just Jiraiya's type...-Otaku) Her face, however, was
scowling, and had several veins popping out of it. Her kimono, a
tight purple and green number, was swaying with the force of her
writhing tails. The agitation poured off her in waves.</p><P>"Ah,
Kurina, a pleasure to see you again!" He said, grinning behind
his desk.</p><P>"Cut
the shit, Kyuubi-sama. Where the fuck have you been for the past
thirteen years?!" She growled. He was actually surprised that
she kept up the -sama bit. She was after all, mightily pissed, and
though he could take her in a fight, he really didn't want to lose
one of his best negotiators.</p><P>"Now,
now Kurina-chan, wouldn't you rather reminisce with your old
childhood friend, rather than interogate him?" He asked,
sweetly pleading. He winced when her glare turned cold.</p><P>"No."</p><P>Kyuubi
sighed. There was no way he was getting out of this one, and to tell
the truth, Kurina would be able to do a better job, if she knew the
truth. His smile vanished in calm, and he focused on the subject at
hand.</p><P>"Kurina,
you must swear never to use this information that I am about to tell
you against anyone that it pertains to. Do you swear?"</p><P>"Is
this information that dangerous, milord?" She said, her eyes
narrowed. Something this dangerous should be public knowledge, to
protect those that would be harmed by it. Surely Kyuubi was kidding
about the level of secrecy. Making her swear meant she could never
use it against them, lest she die in the act.</p><P>"Yes,
it is Kurina." She was surprised at the look of pleading on the
elder fox's face. What in the world would he want to protect so
much?</p><P>"I
swear." She said, feeling her nature bind her more securely
than any contract ever could. She would never use it against them,
not on pain of death, for it would be her death in the end.</p><P>"I
was sealed. After...Well, I went on a rampage, and ended up in
Konoha, one of the human's ninja villages. I nearly decimated the
entire village, and one of their leaders gave up his life to seal me
into his newborn son. That's where I've been for the past thirteen
years. Within that child, helping him, and calming myself.</p><P>"But,
because of me, they thought him the demon who had attacked their
home. They did such horrible things to him, Kurina. And all I could
do was heal the boy when they were done playing with him. I...I've
never seen such cruelty, and I realised why most of the other
Demonlords moved their kind away from the humans.</p><P>"But
I also saw kindness. I gained two mates from those thirteen years,
Kurina, and I've never been happier." Here he smiled at her, all
the sadness of the rest of his tale seemingly forgotten. But the look
of joy as quickly wiped away as he spoke again.</p><P>"But,
my container is severely damaged, psychologically, from what that
damnable village did to him. I have to protect him Kurina. I don't
ever want to see him hurt again."</p><P>Kurina,
good subordinate that she was, plagued Kyuubi for the details, and
after recieving them, was growling, maternal instincts on the prowl. 
She was surprised at the restraint Kyuubi had shown in the village. 
Kyuubi wasn't exactly the most level-headed kitsune she knew, and
even SHE would have had a hard time controlling her temper.</p><P>Humans
truly were the most greedy, arrogant, and cruel race on the face of
the planet.</p><P>She
bowed, low, to her leader, "I understand, Kyuubi-sama, and will
do my best to protect your mates as well." She looked up, and
with a smile that called back ancient memories for Kyuubi, she said,
"And I know that you will give those boys a life they deserve."</p><P>With
that she exited the office, and Kyuubi watched as the door swung shut
behind her.</p><P>"Well,
that went well."</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKTISKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Haku
and Zabuza were at the moment being taken through the halls of the
giant tree, memorising as they went the twists and turns. They were
being led by two of the servants, household gaurds. Each of the
servants had four tails, and they were extrememly pompous, atleast,
so it seemed to Zabuza.</p><P>The
manse was extremely impressive. It was carved out of the inside of a
living tree, yet there was always enough light, and the walls even
looked like they were built out of warm white marble. It was most
likely a genjutsu, but one so strong, Zabuza couldn't dispell it. 
The foxes assured them time and again that the genjutsu was only on
the surface, not changing anything, but just making it look nice.</p><P>"After
all," one said with a grin, "we Kitsune love luxury."</p><P>And
Haku believed it. He had never seen such luxurious housing. The
halls were huge, as were the rooms they passed. beautiful things
filled the alcoves they meandered by, and he almost gasped in awe as
they came to an opening to the outside.</p><P>Or
so he had thought. What they actually came to was the garden in
front of the servant housing. The entire place was surrounded by the
trunk of the great tree, but there was enough light that it looked
much like someone had put a garden in the middle of a forest. Haku
controlled his urge to squeal in delight, as he quickly glanced at
Zabuza. Receiving the most miniscule nod in history, he began
wandering through the garden, naming off the plants he knew and their
uses, softly to himself, wondering over the plants he had never seen
before.</p><P>Zabuza,
meanwhile, followed the foxes to the house in the back of the garden.
 It was by no means big, containing just enough room for all fifty of
the servants and gaurds. It had plenty of panels that opened to the
outside, so that light and fresh air could be let into the ancient
japanese style house. It was rather beautiful, and Zabuza truly did
like it.</p><P>He
sat on the porch, looking out into the garden, where he could see
Haku's dark head meandering in the feild of green and other vibrant
colors. He sighed a bit, and one of the foxes smirked at him. 
Turning a rusty red-haired head towards Zabuza, he could smell the
indecision and fear coming from the man. This big man was either
seriously afraid of the slim androgynous boy, or he was scared of
something else.</p><P>The
fox (We'll call him Genji, from now on, mkay? -Otaku) got a
mischeivious look in his bright golden-brown eyes. He had always
enjoyed being one of the ones playing tricks on the ningens that
accidentally strayed into their borders, when he had that duty, and
he had just figured out how he could have a tiny bit of that fun
right now...</p><P>"What
a beautiful human child." He said, allowing a bit of faked lust
to tinge his voice. Sure, the boy was beautiful, but Genji had a
pregnant mate back home, and she was taking up all of his time. 
Demanding that he get her this, that he find her that, all in payment
for three of the kits from the litter. Jeeze, he really should have
just conceived himself, it would have been so much easier.</p><P>Zabuza's
reaction was instantaneous. He stiffened, ready to attack, and was
growling just a bit beneath his breath. Genji really doubted the
human even knew he was making such a threatening sound. He yipped a
bit in laughter. The human sure was gullible.</p><P>"He'd
make a man a fine mate one day..." Genji continued to bait the
human. Again, the big man's reaction was instantaneous. He whipped
around to glare at the Kitsune, as if he was suggesting HE would take
the boy.</p><P>"Hey,
hey, I'm just messing with you, ok? Jeeze, haven't you ever heard
the saying crazy like a fox? That was made becuase of us, so you
might want to get used to some light teasing. Especially with one so
pretty at your side." Genji smiled, getting up to go inside. 
After all, it would be no fun teasing him, if he was constantly on
gaurd.</p><P>Zabuza
felt like the biggest heel ever.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Tohru
had stopped, for one friggin' second! ONE FRIGGIN' SECOND! To look at
some priceless vese thingy, that had somehow cuaght his attention,
and the foxes and his two companions-in-servitude had dissapeared!
God he hated his luck.</p><P>And
now, after trying to find them in the maze of cooridors, he was lost.
 He really did hate his sense of direction. It was almost as if the
gods had decided to torure him. Bad luck, AND an extremely bad sense
of direction! ARGH!!</p><P>He
was wondering pretty much aimlessly, waiting until he found someone
he could ask directions from. He was also creating a bit of a mental
map in his head, but it was seriously confused, becuase he couldn't
remember where the beginning was!</p><P>He
was about to give up entirely, when he found an interesting looking
alcove. It was just a little cave-like entrance, and he, being
curious by nature, intended to investigate it. Stepping through the
little opening cautiously, he gasped.</p><P>Inside
the alcove, was a room. The room was filled with plants of amazing
varieties he had never seen before. It was a little dark, but there
were ribbons of light streaming down, as if there was a few holes in
the ceiling. It made the place reverant and beautiful.</p><P>There
was a small fountain by the back wall, and Tohru kneeled in front of
it, sniffing it experimentally. As a ninja, he had been trained to
smell a taint in water, before he ever dared to take a drink. But
this water smelled pure, purer than any water he had ever drank
before. He dipped his hand into it, gently, and pulled up a bit,
drinking from the palm.</p><P>He
felt something then he had never felt before in his life.</p><P>He
felt his dying cells start to regrow, through no use of chakra on his
own part. He felt the tissues that had been killed off by the
malignant disease he still carried from his childhood come back to
life, as if being reborn.</p><P>As
a yound child, he had been pronounced unable to live to adulthood. 
So he had decided that, since it didn't matter if he lived or died
anyway, he was going to try his hand at being a ninja. After all,
they die at a young age anyway, and they usually gain just a bit of
glory before they die. Maybe then his mother would stop coddling
him, and his brothers would stop calling him weak, just becuase he
couldn't work in the family business.</p><P>As
he learned more in the academy, he had concentrated the most on
chakra. After all, he knew his body wouldn't really be able to
handle the strain of being a taijutsu master, so he threw his energy
into studying Chakra. And then he found it. He had watched one of
his Senpai (Elder students) heal himself after a sparring match
against one of the jounin teachers, while he had been practising his
chakra excersises.</p><P>He
had begged the gennin to teach him, and the silver-haired boy had
smiled, and taught him the basics. He would always be thankful to
Kabuto-sensei for that. He had been able to extend his life atleast
three more years. Sure the side-affect was lessening his life-span
in the long run, but, well, if it kept him alive now, then what was
the point in worrying about the future?</p><P>Now,
he had found this spring, and for once, he couldn't literally <I>feel</I>
his body dying around him. He took another mouthful of the water,
and felt healthier than he had in years. He laughed out loud, happy
and giddy at the prospect of living properly.</p><P>He
filled his water-canteen with the stuff, and mentally memorised
exactly how he had come here. He would really have to come here
again. After all, he couldn't be sure if it would cure his illness,
or just keep it at bay.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS

was bored out of his mind, these halls were all the same, except a
few of them had different things in the alcoves. Sasuke wasn't far
behind, and Tsubasa was already climbing all over the blonde, trying
to keep himself entertained.</p><P>The
twins turned, smiling as they stopped in front of a door. It was a
set of double oak doors, carved with intricate designs that were
really hard to make out, and the girls giggled as Naruto leaned
forward, peering at the symbols, trying to see what they were.</p><P>"Naruto-sama,
these are your rooms. Feel free to explore, there are clothes in the
closet for you, and a connected bath to the right. There are wards
on the rooms to tell the gaurds if anyone uninvited enters your
rooms, so be wary of that. Also, your room is right next to
Kyuubi-dono's room, as per his request."</p><P>"Sasuke-sama,
if you will follow me, I will show you to your rooms." The
short-haired one said, beckoning to the dark-haired human. The
avenger followed, a little apprehensive of being seperated from his
blonde friend. He followed the woman past one set of double doors
and onto the set on the other side. He felt releif flood him as he
realised he was only two doors away should the dobe wake up from a
nightmare as he did in Wave country.</p><P>The
maids opened the doors simultaneously, and Naruto set Tsubasa down,
letting him run around and explore the room.</p><P>It
was a cheerful place, painted in a shade of yellow-white, a calming,
soothing color. The bed, set on a dias and surrounded by large bay
windows was huge, and set out with a white and gold bedspread. It
looked so sublime that Naruto just wanted to go jump into it. 
Instead he wandered around the room, noticing several small alcoves
in the walls, assumably where he was supposed to put nicknacks and
such. There were several different levels to the room, accessible by
steps only one or two in length.</p><P>The
blonde categorized the different levels of the room as: The bed
area, the desk area, and the dressing area. The dressing area was in
a corner near the entrance with a strange, branch-like petition,
hiding it from view of any incomers. The desk area was as open and
inviting as the bed area, with tons of windows around it, off-white
curtains blowing in the breeze.</p><P>Tsubasa
exclaimed and Naruto went to go see what the toddler was so happy
about, and gasped, as he found the biggest, prettiest bathroom he had
ever seen. It looked as if the walls were branches wrapped together,
carved from ivory, and the bath was sunken into the floor, big enough
for three people to fit in comfortably (Hey, minds out of the gutter
people...grins -Otaku) with jars and bottles surrounding it, all
looking like crystals pulled fromt he deepest depths of the seas. 
They were filled with lotions, shampoos, and soaps of all kinds and
scents.</p><P>There
were windows here too, but they had privacy screens, and still let in
just as much light as the windows in the actual bedroom. In the
bathroom there was a sink, and a huge mirror as well, with lots of
cosmetics and skin-care products on the counter. Naruto was starting
to think that they had thought he was female.</p><P>"Kyuubi-dono
has indicated that you and Sasuke-sama are given full rights to
redecorate these rooms as you see fit. You are welcome to anything
in the manor and the servants are under your command as well." 
The blonde jumped as the voice came from behind him. He turned to
find the fox maid looking at him approvingly. He wondered what
exactly he had done to gain her approval, but it was a welcome
reprieve from the hate-filled stares of the villagers in Konoha.</p><P>Sasuke's
room was much the same, only his was done in twilight colors, reds
and blues and purples. He rather enjoyed it, it was dark, and
brooding, but with enough windows to let in a VERY nice breeze. To
tell the truth, he already felt more at home here. He hadn't
bothered to check out his bathroom, rather prefering to check out the
huge amount of scrolls on the desk.</p><P>From
what he knew of proper cleaning edicate, one did not leave scrolls
and other such things on the desk, while another was coming to stay
in the room. He ran a hand over the old parchment, trying to make
out some of the words in the ancient language. He nearly jumped as a
delicate throat cleared behind him. He turned to face the
long-haired woman, watching her golden eyes twinkle with sadness.</p><P>"Please
excuse the scrolls, Sasuke-sama. This room has been left much to
it's own devices for the last thirteen years. No one was willing to
touch it...after the Lady died." It seemed a touchy subject,
and they really must have loved this Lady, for Sasuke saw tears start
to brim in the woman's eyes.</p><P>"What
was she like? This Lady of yours." He asked, trying to be as
delicate as possible, while still gathering information. He needed
to know, after all, if he was to avoid tramping on any more of these
people's feelings. It was dangerous to make enemies here. After
all, the only true ally they had at the moment in this new land was
Kyuubi, and though he was ruler, he would have to put his people
first.</p><P>The
woman smiled, a whistful look coming to her pretty face. "She
was wonderful. Kind, caring, always knew how to make anyone smile. 
She was always smiling. She was an avid researcher too. Interested
in humans, and what they could do with lands and machines. And
beautiful beyond words. Her eyes were kind and soft, and so very
wise. She was the only eight-tail never to lose herself. That's
probably why Kyuubi-dono fell in love with her."</p><P>Sasuke
frowned a bit. So, there was a reason behind Kyuubi's attack on
Konoha, and it was this woman? He had never gotten around to asking
Naruto or Kyuubi about his reasoning, assuming it was in the past,
and it wasn't going to happen again. Now he had some slight inkling
of it.</p><P>"On
another note, Sasuke-sama, Kyuubi-dono has given you permission to
change the rooms as you see fit, and the servants are yours to
command. You are welcome to anything in the manor house, and both you
and Naruto-sama are to have an escort everytime you leave the
mansion. Is there anything else?" The woman tilted her head to
the side, a trait he had seen many times in wild animals when
something caught their attention.</p><P>"Yes,
I was wondering. Do you and your sister live here? Or do you have
another lodging?" No, Sasuke was not asking out of true
curiousity, but rather had a plan forming. He needed information,
and was beginning to figure out ways to get it. This fox-woman
seemed kind enough, and enough of a mother hen to keep tabs on the
dobe. If he could, he might be able to work it to where he had an
informant on the situations within the manor. Servants were the eyes
and the ears of the castle, after all.</p><P>"No,
Rinko and I will only be here for another half-month, during our
shift. We live here during that time, but after that, we are allowed
to go home, while another shift comes in."</p><P>She
must have seen the confusion in Sasuke's scowl, for she giggled
slightly and smiled. "You see, every month, the servants, in
shifts of twenty five, change. That way, no one is stuck doing the
same work over and over again. Kitsune get bored very easily. It
works the same way for other jobs as well, such as border patrol,
policing, and the public service jobs. One month you may see someone
as a postman, then the next they could end up arresting you. Its a
rather ingenious system that one of the first Nine-tailed Lords came
up with."</p><P>Sasuke
was rather impressed. This demon lord had taken one of his peoples
greatest faults and turned it into something ingenious. It would be
hard to infiltrate, because each shift knew who was on it and who
wasn't. A natural form of protection. Very cunning. He smirked. 
He was beggining to like this society.</p><P>"Last
question, before you can go. What's your name?"</p><P>Smiling,
she replied, "Kinko. I'll fetch you for dinner when the time
comes, if your lordship requires it?"</p><P>Sasuke
nodded then turned back to the scrolls. This was beggining to get
VERY interesting indeed.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Kakashi
had arrived home with a new house guest, and a very pissed off Iruka
waiting at his door. He had never before been so terrified of having
to take a beautiful woman into his home. He swallowed, as the
kitsune woman, in full genjutsu, eyed the brunette at his door.</p><P>Kakashi
went before her, quickly to do damage control. He, before any words
could come out of that pretty little brunettes mouth, kissed him into
submission, then when he was breathless, and slightly out of it,
started to explain.</p><P>"Now,
Iruka, my dolphin, you must understand, this is a mission. I have to
put this woman up in my house for a few weeks. I am not cheating on
you, nor am I leaving you. I love you, and I wouldn't do such a
thing. Besides, you're better in bed than any woman I've ever done,
so I'll stick with you thanks." Iruka blushed, becoming irate
again. Kakashi shushed him with a finger before he could speak again.
"I know we had a date tonight, but I really can't, so can we
reschedule it for tommorrow? I will pick you up after school, and we
will spend the entire night at your house. Ok?"</p><P>(Wow,
Kakashi is one smooth talker, huh? -Otaku)</p><P>Iruka
looked at him, still blushing, and frowned. "I was going to ask
if you found Naruto."</p><P>"Oh."</p><P>The
woman behind Kakashi visibly bridled at the mention of the blonde's
name, and Iruka immediately disliked her. Not only was she staying at
his boyfriends apartment, but she had something against Naruto, too? 
Admittably, the boy could be a handful, but he was a wonderful child,
and a very intelligent student. He just had some problems with his
attention span. (Can anyone say ADD and ADHD, much? -Otaku) But that
could be remedied with a wack on the head. He'd done it plenty of
times!</p><P>"Yes,
I found him, but I couldn't bring him home, Iruka." Kakashi
appeared very sad about this. He knew how his dolphin felt about the
boy. When Naruto had run away, Iruka had beat himself up about it,
sure that it was due to the whole Mizuki incident. Iruka really did
love the boy like a son, or at least an annoying little brother.</p><P>Iruka
put a hand to the silver-haired Sharingan weilder's cheek, smiling
sadly to let him know he didn't blame him. The academy teacher then
kissed him sofly through the mask (Kakashi had pulled it up right
after kissing Iruka into submission -Otaku) and told him he'd see him
tommorrow. And then the love of Kakashi's life was gone.</p><P>The
kitsune raised an eyebrow. "Your mate?"</p><P>Kakashi
looked at her, and finding no signs of sneakiness on her part,
nodded.</p><P>"He's
a good man. He'll make a fine father one day. Very gentle. Makes me
wonder how one such as you ever caught him." She said, as he
unlocked the door. The copy-nin frowned behind his mask. Now that
wasn't very nice.</p><P>"To
put it very simply, I did." He said, leaving it at that. (I'm
thinking of making a side story about how Kakashi 'caught'
Iruka-sensei, exactly. What do you all think? -Otaku) He barely
registered the strange little beetle that flew away, as he closed the
door behind him. After all, he hadn't had a bath in a few days, it
was quite possible that bugs were all over him.</p><P>That
beetle however, immediately went to someone, a someone that was VERY
familiar with this kind of beetle, and any other kind of beetle, or
any bug to be exact. Shino stood in the training grounds of his
team, as the bug settled on his finger. He gently ran a bit of
chakra through its nervous system, replaying the memories of it's
lifespan with Kakashi.</p><P>He
had planted this specific bug after Naruto had dissapeared from the
village. He had figured that Sasuke, who was close friends with
Naruto, would follow the blonde boy, and he had been right. Now he
knew about it. But what confused him the most was Tohru's betrayal. 
Why had the boy left with Sasuke?</p><P>I
mean, sure, he had appeared to be utterly in love with the boy, but
Shino had watched the boy training, and knew that he was single
minded when it came to a goal. He would accomplish that goal with
efficiency, and that included missions. He would make a perfect
assasin someday.</p><P>If
it weren't for the disease he carried. Shino had noticed how even
mosquitos avoided biting the boy. Every animal within a ten mile
radius avoided the boy if they could. Even Kiba disliked being
around him. He just smelled too much like death and rot, no matter
how much he healed himself.</p><P>That
was what had brought Shino's attention onto him. He had seen the
sickly boy training during academy, how, during Taijutsu training, he
would cough up blood and quickly wipe it away so that no one saw. He
began to get stronger, after a while, but he was still very weak in
the taijutsu area. Chakra control was where he had almost no equal.
The only one who had that level of Chakra control in their entire
graduating class was Haruno Sakura, and she was hailed as one of the
smartest in their classes.</p><P>Shino
had wanted to know what had cuased his sudden recovery, yet hadn't
changed the fact that he still smelled like death and decay, as Kiba
whined everytime the boy came near. He was indeed, a very curious
creature.</p><P>End
Chapter </p><P>Otaku:
Okay, so I established the ShinoXTohru pairing a little better. 
That's good, also I got everyone set in and Zabuza on his way to
discovering his feelings for our dear little Haku. Also, we've
gotten a little backstory on Kyuubi's rampage. Who is this
mysterious mate of his?! On top of all that, we've got that
Kitsune-bitch (sorry, but I'm still mad at her for calling Naruto a
bitch.) giving Konoha information!</p><P>Tohru:
Dear god, woman, do you ever shut up?</p><P>Otaku:
Quiet, disease boy!</p><P>Naruto:
Hey! Be nice to sick people!</p><P>Otaku:
does that include Orochimaru?</p><P>Sasuke:
No, he's incurable.</p><P>Tohru:
Hey, so am I!</p><P>Otaku:

don't think that's gonna be for a while yet... Also, there's gonna be
some KakaIru, and just a tad bit of ShinoOC, but don't worry, it's
not for the main plot... Or is it? I'll leave that up to you...</p><P><B>Warnings:

Chap. 9 - I Lie Awake Inside for Hours</B></p><P>Naruto
was gaining weight. He was NOT happy with this. And it wasn't even
muscle! Whenever he woke up in the morning, he poked at the bit of
fat, right there, where his six-pack abs used to be...He could see
it, even if no one else could! Sasuke and Kyuubi had told him
hundreds of times that he wasn't gaining weight, but he knew it! He
could see it! (hormonal women often go through this kind of thing,
and I find it horrendously funny that Naruto would be worried about
how he looks, so bear with me...-Otaku)</p><P>He
stalked over to what he had claimed as his training area. It really
was nothing more than another peaceful little grotto on the giant
tree/hole they called a home. But he had spent hours setting up
practice dummies, wooden beams to practice power, and tons of traps
to make sure he can still dodge with the best of them!</p><P>There,
he proceeded to pummel himself into dust, via several kage bunshin. 
It was a merry brawl, and Tohru, who had been assigned the task of
guarding the Kyuubi-bearer, enjoyed watching the boy literally beat
the shit out of himself. It was quite amusing.</p><P>The
blonde wasn't out of practice, despite his long stint as a village
girl, and was rather agile, if not just a tad obvious. At least he
had gotten rid of the orange jumpsuit, settling instead on a nice
blue and white hakama/kimono set. It wasn't really conducive to
training, but Naruto said that it was training in itself. If he could
fight in it, he could fight in just about anything.</p><P>Not
only that, but the blonde had refused to shear his hair short again. 
It had grown during their stay with Tazuna the bridge builder, and
was now to his shoulders. Still spikey, and just as golden, he
surprisingly reminded Tohru of the picture in the Hokage's office of
the Yondaime (Fourth lord) Hokage (literal translation: Fire shadow,
but it's the title of the lord of Konohagakure).</p><P>All
the maids in the castle, whom Tohru had gotten to know pretty well
due to mutual servitude, seemed to adore the little blonde
Jinchuriiki. He and Sasuke were the latest gossip, everyone
wondering how their relationship with Kyuubi was arranged, how they
had caught their Lord's attention. It amused Tohru to no end, but he
knew that they couldn't afford for anyone to find out that Naruto was
really Kyuubi's jailer. They'd be dead in instants. Probably many
times over, as well.</p><P>Naruto
slammed a kick into one of the wooden dummies, splintering it, giving
a grunt of satisfaction.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Tsubasa
was doing essentially the same thing as his foster father. He was in
another practice field, learning the basics of Taijutsu, from the fox
who had trained all of the royal bodyguards. He had spent the
previous hours learning the names of his teachers, three in all. He
still remembered them.</p><P>Toji-sensei
was in charge of history, and other schooling. He was an old fox,
silver from age, who preferred staying in the half-human form that
most of the elders were comfortable with. He tended to smack really
hard with his walking stick if you weren't paying attention.</p><P>Amane-sensei
was in charge of ethics and manners. She was a nice, matronly
kitsune, who had a good grasp on the ways of the world, and a very
kind smile. She had given Tsubasa a bit of sticky rice candy when he
had met her.</p><P>And
finally, his combat teacher, Gin-sensei, who the little kitsune
couldn't determine a gender on... This sensei, the minute they had
met, had attacked Tsubasa, and the boy had been scared out of his
wits. Then, laughing, the androgynous fox had explained that he was
trying to judge how well Tsubasa reacted to threats. Then he looked
at Kyuubi, and smirked.</p><P>"You
brought me a really great one here, Kyuubi-dono. No formal training
at all, not even survival instincts, if you ask me. Sheesh, and you
expect him to be able to protect Naruto-sama's kit by the time it's
born?! Sorry, but not gonna happen."</p><P>Kyuubi
looked at Gin, and gave him a look that curdled milk from thirty
paces.</p><P>"I
want him kicking the shit out of five tails by the time my kit is
born. He has four hours of classes, and then you can have him for the
rest of the day. Make sure he eats, and sleeps at least six hours a
night, but other than that, he's all yours." The older red-head
then turned, and stalked away.</p><P>Tsubasa
turned to look at his new teacher, but the creature, still rather
indecisive about it's gender, appearantly, still stared after it's
master, a frown on it's features. Then it turned to the little one,
and smiled. Tsubasa did NOT like that smile.</p><P>"Alright,
little one, you are on an extreme regiment. That means you are going
to be training your little ass off. Now, come along."</p><P>After
ten minutes, he had been fitted with weights, and the severe weight
of them already had his body aching. But this was for Naruto-dono's
kit, to be able to protect it, the way Naruto-dono had protected him.
He would do anything for Naruto-dono, and he fully intended to try
his best.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Poor
Haku. He'd only made the slight mistake of trying to tend one small
(rather life-threatening if it had been to a human. But Kitsune heal
rather quickly, Naruto is evidence. -Otaku) injury. Turns out, he was
the closest thing to a doctor the Kitsune had! They always just
wrapped up their injuries, and hoped to the gods they didn't get
infected.</p><P>He
sighed, as he was forced to belie his training with Zabuza-san, in
order to treat the three sick toddlers one of the female kitsune had
brought to him. He glanced apologetically over at the elder ninja,
who at the moment was glaring at a poor innocent speck of dirt. Poor
dirt, what did it ever do to get on Zabuza-san's bad side?</p><P>Zabuza
will tell you what it did! He'll tell ya, alright! It did NOTHING!
That's right, it did nothing, this morning as that <I>Genji</I>
brought in a few of his friends to point out the 'pretty new human'
and flirt endlessly with the boy!! ARGH!!!</p><P>And
the worst thing was, normally, he'd scare the damnable foxes off, but
Haku, poor innocent Haku, hadn't dealt with that kind of attention
before, and sadly, he would need to, especially if he was ever to
find a wife! Or boyfriend...Or WHATEVER, dammit! Ugh, his head
hurt...</p><P>And
what's even worse than that? The overwhelming urge to just give up on
finding the boy any type of lover, and just ignoring THAT part of
life forever! But, Zabuza knew for a fact that NO ONE can stay
celibate forever. Sooner or later, they crack, and he did NOT want to
be around when a sexually frustrated Haku finally DID crack.</p><P>Or
maybe the real problem was he DID.</p><P>He
really needed to stop thinking. It was hazardous to his health.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Kyuubi,
after settling the brat into his new training schedule, went back to
his office. Sighing, he wondered if he was doing the right thing. He
had seen what this kind of training did to people, Hyuuga Neji being
one of them. That boy was wound tighter than a spring, and bound to
snap at any moment.</p><P>Kyuubi
couldn't afford to second guess himself now though. Now that he was
back, soon the other tailed lords would come out of hiding, and try
to see if he was the same Kyuubi as had put them in their place so
long ago. If he wasn't powerful enough, nor concentrated enough to
take them on, he'd lose everything.</p><P>That,
and Kurina-chan wouldn't just never forgive him, she'd skin him alive
and wear his fur as a coat.</p><P>Sighing,
Kyuubi thought back, to when he had time to spy on the humans. Back
when the Shodaime and his partner had just began to make the
Konohagakure. The humans had made rulership look so easy. Now he
regretted ever thinking it was.</p><P>Giving
up on depressing thoughts, he turned his attention back to his paper
work, determined to finish at least a third of it by dinner time.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Iruka
wasn't just pissed. No, by no means. He was IRATE. The normally
gentle chuunin was by no means docile right now. He was waiting. He
had been stood up three times this week. THREE TIMES! By Kakashi, who
always gave him the same excuse. His mission refused to work with
him.</p><P>Iruka
was about ready to tell Kakashi's mission to go screw itself, and
murder the bitch. She was taking his Kakashi away from him, and THAT
was an inexcusable crime.</p><P>Growling,
as he stood outside the restaurant for the third time, waiting once
again for his silver-maned Jounin to show up. The crowd, for it was
dinner time, and there was indeed a crowd, skirted around the angry
teacher. The matra'de(I think that's how its spelled. You know the
fancy French guy who seats you? Him. -Otaku) came over, once again,
for the seventh time that night, asking if perhaps Iruka would like
to order, and he'd inform Kakashi when he got there?</p><P>Iruka,
sighing, gave up. He just didn't have the energy for this. After
teaching classes all day, (Do you have ANY idea how tiring it is to
teach ten year olds with REALLY pointy objects? Yeah, I thought so.
-Otaku) he just didn't have the patience to deal with Kakashi and
that twit too. If Kakashi was cheating on him, so be it. It wasn't as
if he hadn't been single before.</p><P>Smiling
sadly, "No, sir, I'm sorry to be a bother. If Kakashi finally
does show up, tell him I went home, alright? Thank you." And he
walked away. Or he was going too.</p><P>About
a block from the restaurant, his arm was tugged, pulling him to a
stop. He turned around, a cross look on his face, only to be replaced
by surprise.</p><P>There
was his one-eyed journeyman, looking at him with an incredibly sad
look on his face.</p><P>"Iruka?
Why aren't you at the restaurant?"</p><P>Iruka
twitched. His bangs covering his eyes, his aura radiating killer
intent, he growled at Kakashi. Literally GROWLED at the famous
Copy-nin of Konoha.</p><P>"Oh,
I don't know Kakashi! How about the fact that I was waiting since
NOON, to have dinner with you?! I know you have a habit of being
late, even to our dates sometimes, but nine hours is a bit excessive,
isn't it? Was she THAT good? Hmm?" Iruka was furious, spitting
flames at Kakashi, and the Jounin wasn't sure exactly what Iruka
meant.</p><P>"Dolphin,
hold on for a minute, what do you mean? Who?"</p><P>"Oh
don't lie to me, Kakashi! That tramp back at your apartment! She's
gotta be one hell of a peice of ass! Definately better than me,
obviously! Do you seriously think I am blind enough not to notice?
Or maybe you wanted me to notice, and complain, so you'd have a
reason to break up with me, without feeling guilty?! Well, y'know
Kakashi, I'm do-"</p><P>Kakashi
tried desperately to silence the hurtful words coming out of his
beloved's mouth, tried to stifle them with heartfelt, tender kisses.
But Iruka's pain-filled, spiteful eyes silenced those kisses.</p><P>"You
can't fix this with kisses, Kakashi. I'm sorry, but I...I can't do
this. Not until...Not with everything thats been going on."</p><P>Those
words broke Kakashi's heart. He really, truly loved Iruka, and those
words...It was as if Obito had died all over again. And the look on
Iruka's face, as if it was hurting him too, just made it all the more
real.</p><P>"Come
back after your missions over, Kakashi. Then we'll talk."</p><P>And
Iruka left, leaving Kakashi crying, only visible from one eye, for
the other wasn't his to begin with...</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>(
I just realized I never gave this bitch a name...How's Tsumi sound to
everyone? Ok, Tsumi it is. -Otaku)</p><P>Tsumi
smirked, from the shadows as she watched the schoolteacher ruin the
best thing in his life. Oh yes, she had watched, and she had noticed
how heavily the dolphin relied on his Kakashi during the trial. He
needed the silver one, as much as the silver one needed him.</p><P>She
took pride that she had split them so effectively. After all, if his
human family was in ruins, scattered to the winds, while he was gone,
wouldn't the bitch that stole her kit feel it all the more? That he
wasn't there to protect them?</p><P>Of
course he would.</p><P>He
was human, after all.</p><P>Now,
what more damage could she do to this pristine town, what more pain
could she inflict on that lovely blonde child? If she remembered the

I'm so sorry! Please forgive me! I've been having a hard time writing
recently, so it took a really long time to write anything! I
apologize profusely! (That means a lot. -Sasuke) Also, it doesn't
help that I'm having a hard time with the plot...The plot bunny kinda
abandoned me half way. Any ideas your guys have for how evil I can
make Tsumi, feel free to spill. Also, any ideas on attacks that the
main charas can learn, I could use those too. Thanks!</p><P><B>Kits!</B></p><P><B>Pairings:

the other chapters.</p><P><B>Warnings:
</B>Evilness of the Tsumi-kind,
A little bit of Angst in Naruto's direction, Bookish!Sasuke, and a
tiny bit of OC-specialness. Sorry about that, it was the only way I
could figure out how to get Tohru in contact with Shino.</p><P><B>Description:
</B>Haku and Zabuza finally get
together, Naruto angsts, Sasuke reads, Tsumi converts Sakura, and
Kyuubi finds a challenge laid at his feet.</p><P><B>Disclaimer:

would be running around town as if it were normal.</p><P><B>Kits!
Chapter 10 – And Watch My Purple Sky Fly Over Me</B></p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Haku:
14</p><P>Zabuza:
20 (Sorry if this is wrong, but he always struck me as twenty...)</p><P>After
learning their rounds, and finding that the guards were just as petty
and interesting as normal ninja, Haku and Zabuza settled into their
new home quite nicely. Haku was still hit on by quite a few kitsune,
and not just male ones either, and Zabuza was still mostly in denial.</p><P>Sadly,
this was causing problems.</p><P>Even
Kyuubi had noticed (which was kind of unavoidable, seeing as Haku and
Zabuza were basically his bodygaurds). Deciding that he really
didn't have time to deal with this, he put it off, sure that he could
fix it later.</p><P>However,
this wasn't going to happen.</p><P>It
seemed that Haku had noticed his master's reluctance, and strange
glances in his own general direction. Seeing this as a hint, Haku
decided to put caution on the bedside table for now, and make a move.</p><P>Pulling
that crafty little leaf-nin Tohru into the mix, Haku hatched some
plans. He was going to win him a man. And not just any man, either. 
He had had his eye on Zabuza for quite some time.</p><P>Zabuza
was his precious person, and when Zabuza was unhappy, Haku wanted to
make sure that NO ONE was happy. Haku had known long ago that he
loved Zabuza as more than an adoptive father. The dark-haired boy
was innocent, not stupid.</p><P>He
and Tohru began leaving hints. Dropping little clues around the
manor, all over their shared hut, and most assuredly in whatever
bathing room Zabuza decided to use.</p><P>The
entire kingdome was hanging on the edge of their seats, wondering if
the clueless mist nin would get it, or go on in his hopeless stupor.
It was great fun for the kitsune, who found that human romance was
quite a bit more complicate than their own. Watching it was almost
as fun as playing tricks on humans. Some were even taking bets on
who would break down first.</p><P>After
all, there were two sides to this. Zabuza was suffering as well. He
wanted so badly to stake a claim on the dark haired femme-nin. He
had raised the boy, after all! He loved him more than any man had a
right to, and he was damned if he lost his Shuriken to some fox!</p><P>But...He
couldn't take it if Haku left, if he was disgusted with him. He
couldn't take that.</p><P>So
it went on like this. They were pussy-footing around each other,
trying hard to not put their hearts on the line, yet wanting so badly
to. They despaired of ever telling the other.</p><P>That
is, until Naruto, in a fit of Hormonal!Naru-ness, slammed his hands
down at the dinner table, where all of his friends gathered, no
matter what their station, and stood.</p><P>Blue
eyes feirce, everyone wondered what the blonde jinchuriiki was going
to say. His blonde hair swayed with his movements as he turned his
head to look at the two former mist nins. Pointing one hand to
Zabuza, he glared at the man.</p><P>"You
idiot. Haku is in love with you! Just kiss him and get it over with!"
Then turning to Haku, who was blushing furiously and trying to hide
under the table, he declared, "And next time you put a note in
my bathroom for Zabuza, Haku, I will personally skin you alive and
eat you. Do you understand?"</p><P>A
squeaked affirmative was the only response. Zabuza was frozen in
shock, wondering if what the blonde had said was true. Naruto had
not lied to him yet, nor had any reason to. Turning to his brown eyed
Shuriken, he saw the dark blush staining his cheeks, the hopeful, yet
bashful smile the ice-nin threw his way.</p><P>It
was true!</p><P>Several
kitsune lost their houses and other valuable items in that bet, but
one certain nine-tails made one hell of a killing off of the odds. 
From that day on, it was known through out the fox kingdom that the
Lord's two gaurds were lovers, and feircely protective of one
another.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Tohru:
14</p><P>Tohru,
in the midst of this happy new coupling, was feeling a bit lonely.
The resident red-head had his two mates, and now Haku had Zabuza, and
he had no one. Yeah, there were plenty of eligable fox-bachelors out
there, but they weren't looking for a mate, they were looking for one
night stands. He wanted a boyfriend, someone he could protect, and
could protect him.</p><P>It
wasn't a very fruitful wish, was it?</p><P>No,
especially not since Tohru could die at any point in time. He had
examined the fountain water, and found that it worked even when
diluted by regular water, so all he had to do was keep one water
bottle and dilute it, and it would last atleast a month.</p><P>However,
he found that it was not some wonder-cure. It only prolonged his life
theoretically. Cells can only replicate a certain amount of times
per life, and Tohru had no idea how many times his would be able to. 
This worried him thoroughly.</p><P>He
found that it had strange effects on animals though. Expecially
insects, for some strange reason. He had tested it, touching a
butterfly with but a drop, and watching as the butterfly mutated. It
had taken on a humanoid shape, growing larger, to about the size of
his spread out hand. Its coloring didn't change, but it gained the
ability to speak, which kind of freaked him out when he realised.</p><P>It
hailed him as its creator, and begged to be of service to him.</p><P>This
gave him a bright idea. Having the upperhand would be far easier, if
they could keep a good stream of reliable information. Training the
butterfly, or rather Aurora, as he named her, to gather information
silently, and to defend herself, he then sent her off, to retreive
information from the Konohagakure no Sato.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Naruto:
13</p><P>Pregnancy:
three months</p><P>Naruto
felt better after his daily training sessions, and felt utterly at
peace in Kyuubi's home. The servants were kind, and never had any
problems stopping to talk to the bored container. He positively
adored Kinko and her sister. They were beacons in the boring house
of his kitsune mate.</p><P>Mate.
It was an interesting thing. He really had never thought he would
have a mate, or wife, or whatever. He had assumed he would die
alone, with no one having loved him. Respected him, yes, but loved
him? The container for the most powerful demon in existance, set to
go berserk any time soon? Not a chance.</p><P>Then
again, he hadn't expected to get knocked up, either.</p><P>And
that was another thing. He felt infinitely safer here, in
Kitsunegakure, but...It was strange. He still had nightmares, dreams
about faceless shadows coming in the dark and tormenting him, beating
him, putting him through the tortures all over again.</p><P>He
really hated them, and he was rather unsure what he was supposed to
do with them. He didn't dare talk to anyone about them, after all,
Kyuubi had too much to worry about, Sasuke was busy with his new
obsession, and he really had no one he could talk to about that kind
of stuff.</p><P>He
missed Tsubasa as well. He missed having the little body to cuddle.
Ever since Kyuubi had handed the boy over to his teachers to rear, he
hadn't seen much of him. Every time he did, he saw the same smile he
used to give his friends, the 'Don't worry, I'm fine' one, and he
would always say that he was happy doing what he could.</p><P>Naruto
was immensely proud of his demonic foundling. The boy was growing in
leaps and bounds, if not physically, then mentally at the very least.</p><P>The
first month in Naruto's new home was spent mostly in exploration of
the huge, half underground, half in tree, half in air home, and in
training himself, after two months of down time. He was rusty in his
ninjutsu, not to mention taijutsu. Genjustu he'd never been very
good at, but hey, he figured it wouldn't hurt to practise that too.</p><P>It
was lucky that he had found a library, filled with all sorts of
strange books, all about the uses of Yokai, and other such things. It
was really interesting, and Naruto enjoyed experimenting with it.
Overall, he still felt useless though. What was he doing here,
besides hiding away? He didn't have any goals anymore. He had always
wanted to be Hokage, but...Once the village found out that he was
some kind of he-she freak as well as a monster, they would NEVER let
him take that role.</p><P>He
felt lost.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Tsumi:
134 years old (looks 20)</p><P>Tsumi
was exasperated. No matter how she tried, she just couldn't find any
contact with the snake in the grass of Konoha. It was strange.
Though she found information about each of the three Sannin, the
legendary team of Ninja said to each be Hokage level or better, but
as for finding any of them, it seemed near impossible.</p><P>It
seemed Tsunade-hime had gone off of active duty, and Jiraiya was
taking full use of his Journeyman status, and travelling. But of
Orochimaru, there was no word. It was as if he had dissapeared off
the face of the planet.</p><P>She
was lucky enough though that she had gotten the Hokage to keep the
Chuunin exams scheduled for the end of the year. If what Kakashi had
said in his report was correct, than the bitch who stole her Tsubasa
would be back then. And that was when she would get her revenge.</p><P>Kakashi
was still pouting, in his special little way, over Iruka. His eye
had turned cold whenever he saw her, and he never volunteered
information anymore. He was taking the breakup hard, and that though
alone made her smile.</p><P>Iruka
was twice as bad, however. He had to be taken off of active teaching
duty, becuase three accidents had happened in his class already, and
he just hadn't been stable ever since. He languished around his
home, and though the two weren't by any means secretive, none of
their friends knew how to help either the dolphin or the scarecrow.</p><P>It
was sad.</p><P>But
not as sad as what Tsumi had planned next.</p><P>The
pink haired wench, one who was investigating every bit of ancient
lore on the kitsune race, interested her. She had watched, and the
bitch would make a good apprentice, especially with her mastery of
the humans yokai, their spiritual art. She was a special kit, that
was for sure, and Tsumi planned to teach her everything she knew.</p><P>Getting
Sakura's trust was easy enough. The Haruno was looking for someone,
anyone to idolize, and all Tsumi had to do was show up to a few of
Kakashi's team's practises, and ask to spar with Kakashi. Every time
she beat Kakashi into the ground, through kitsune arts, but beat him
none the less, the she-klit became enamored of the idea of being just
like her.</p><P>One
day, after just such a beat down, Sakura caught up with her, and
begged her to be her teacher. Smiling, Tsumi accepted, sure she
could use this kit to bring down the whole of Konoha, from the
inside, breaking both the blonde one, and the girl, at the same time.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS
</B></p><P>Sasuke:
14</p><P>Sasuke
wasn't nearly as bored as his blonde companion. In between bouts of
training, he found himself reading through the strange maps and texts
in his room, all written by the mysterious she-fox.</p><P>He
found them utterly fascinating. More so even than the lessons and
practices spent with his father and elder brother. He marvelled at
the world that this vixen described, at the strange actions he knew
so well, yet were now annalyzed in front of him.</p><P>From
an outsiders perspective, most of the worlds societies were laid
bare, annalyzed, processed, and put into simple terms and explained. 
The more he read, the more he understood. And it wasn't just his own
societies, either. They were compared to the kitsune's mental states,
to the very way of life the fox-people lead.</p><P>Through
examples, he began to be able to compare the two minds of any fox and
any human. He was beginning to be able to judge what either type of
mind would do in any circumstance. It was hard, as each mind was
different, as was each individuals response, but he was getting
better, as time went by.</p><P>It
wasn't long before he became known around the fox-village as the
Bookish Prince. He was always seen carrying a book, open in front of
him, reading, or comparing. He was always that way. And though not
cold, he was definately reclusive.</p><P>That
was another thing he had noticed. The foxes were at a loss as to what
to call himself and Naruto. Usually, one of them told him, they
called their leader's mates lady, since it was almost always males
that held the ninth tail, but now, their lord had male mates, and
they couldn't exactly call Naruto a lady. Knowing his hormones, he'd
either burst out crying, or kill the person. He really was getting
moody.</p><P>So,
Sasuke nudged them silently in the direction of Prince. It was
simple, and effective, and it wasn't as if they were going to gain
the throne any time soon anyway, seeing as they didn't even HAVE
tails.</p><P>The
city had changed him. No longer around a constant reminder of his
brothers betrayal, his mind quieted, and he began to wonder just what
Itachi was thinking, leaving a survivor. If it had been him, he
would have murdered them all. Every last babe, every last old man,
every single Uchiha, not one left alive.</p><P>So
why, when his brother was hailed as a genius in tactics and speed,
why had he left a weakling like the young Uchiha alive?</p><P>The
only thing he could figure was that Itachi either felt guilty and
wanted someone to track him down and kill him, or the elder simply
wanted a play thing. He wanted someone to chase after him, so that he
could toy with him, over and over.</p><P>So,
Sasuke decided, he would get stronger, but he would do it in a way
his brother never expected. Not by chasing after the fading
after-image of the oldest Uchiha, but by learning, by gaining
knowledge of things that Itachi couldn't possibly know.</p><P>Sasuke
began chronicle-ing things. Everything he learned from the dead Lady,
everything he discovered about his own body, everything, he wrote it
down, and stored it, sure that it would come in handy some time much
later.</p><P>The
villagers noticed, and began to beleive that perhaps their dear Lady
had come back to them, only in the form of two human boys. For,
where Sasuke had her inquisitiveness, her patience and
knowledge-lust, Naruto was kind and warm, always willing to give a
hand, or a smile, just as she had been.</p><P>To
them, Kitsunegakure was beginning to become whole again, just as
their Kyuubi had been brought back to them.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Kyuubi:
Do I really have to say it? He's like...ancient, okay?</p><P>Kyuubi,
though bogged down with work, was happier than he had ever been. He
still hadn't gotten to be...ahem, intimate, with Naruto, or Sasuke
for that matter, but that was the hazards of having this kind of job.
It often kept him up far past the time they went to bed.</p><P>More
and more often he actually wondered if he should even try to get
intimate with Naruto. The boy was damaged, mentally. He had suffered
violations upon violations against his mind and soul, as well as his
body, and though he had the strength to smile each day, Kyuubi was
especially worried.</p><P>He
knew he was leaving the blonde on his own most of the time. He was
actually hoping that that might heal the damage, just a bit. Letting
the boy learn that he wasn't in that environment any more seemed the
best idea, though he wasn't sure it was working.</p><P>He
wondered, afraid to even speak of it, lest he trigger something in
Naruto. True, he knew the jinchuriiki better than anyone, but the
blonde was unpredictable. He was a paradox, an enigma who kept
himself isolated.</p><P>As
far as he knew, there was only one healer who could heal that kind of
mental damage, and she was dead. That thought made him pause. His
beautiful, kind, smart mate, precious beyond words, and now dead. 
She had been able to heal most anything, and it was said, she taught
her healing ways onto some human somewhere, but it wasn't confirmed.</p><P>He
didn't know if anyone else could help his little mate, but it seemed
he was doing well, somewhat.</p><P>"What
is weighing so heavily on your mind that you can't finish your
paperwork, Kyuubi-sama?"</p><P>The
voice chilled Kyuubi to the core, and he turned to see a very pissed
off Kurina-chan. She knew he had been off in Lala Land, shirking his
duties, again. She knew, and she was angry. Angry Kurina was NOT a
good thing.</p><P>"N-now,
Kurina-chan, I was only thinking of cute little Naru-kun!"</p><P>Her
wrath stopped, mid-strike, an eyebrow raised. The boy had been on her
mind as well. All the kitsune could feel the inner hurt and
malignant fear stagnating in her lords mate. It saddened them that
one so young, so proud, had been felled so low. What the humans had
done was unforgiveable in her eyes.</p><P>But
they only knew of one person who had the skills to heal that kind of
hurt, and she was long gone, thirteen years dead. It was a shame.</p><P>"Well,
you don't have time to worry so much over your mate, my lord. This
arrived today, from boar country. It says its for your eyes only,
and from the third tail, Lord of the Boars."</p><P>Groaning,
becuase he knew what it was, he took it from her, tearing it open.
Reading it quickly, it was just as he'd feared. Arashi was to be the
first of all eight of his brethren to test him, to see if he still
had the strength to be the nine-tails.</p><P>Cursing
outloud, he read through again, this time catching the date. He had
one month, until the three-tailed boar came to his home, and demanded
a fight. He sighed, slumping against his desk. It just wasn't fair.
Why must one always fight to stay on top?!</p><P>End

 Seriously, do I have to say this in every chapter? The only definite

Another month passes by, and several things happen, including a
certain mating ceremony, and one very anticipated fight...</p><P>Disclaimer:
If I owned Naruto, we'd be seeing a whole lot more than just two
jinchuuriiki, we would meet all of them in like...ten episodes. So,
obviously, I don't own it.</p><P>Kits!
-</p><P>Shino:
14</p><P>Shino
was lucky his parents hadn't discovered the strange insect first, or
even one of his clan. He was suprised by it really. It was such an
accident, discovering it. He had been practising with his Kikaichuu
(The chakra-eating bugs in his system) and they had informed him of a
strange, unknown lifeform.</p><P>Following
his insects to it, he was surprised to see what appeared to be a
faerie from the mideival legends. It rather looked like a tiny,
androgynous, butterfy-winged human with very long, tilted ears. Its
little chest moved up and down, as it drew breath, steadily, easily,
as if it were asleep. It was strange, and Shino had a VERY hard time
suppressing the urge to poke it, as his teammate Kiba would have.</p><P>He
also had to suppress the urge to give out a Hinata-like squeal when
it moved, sitting up and blinking its large, pupil-less, liquid,
crimson-purple eyes. It gasped, showing small, gentle fangs. 
Standing, gracefully, it flitted its wings, making sure they were in
working order. Finding that the peacock-like designed, brittle things
were fine, it turned its curious eyes back to Shino, antennae
twitching, trying to figure out what this large creature that looks
only nominally like its Creator-Master does.</p><P>"What
are you?" Shino asked, almost to himself, not expecting to get
an answer from the strange little being. It tilted its head, before
flitting into the air, smiling, and bowing, just as it had done the
first time it saw its Creator-Master.</p><P>"What
are you?" It asked, unable to answer the question. It would have
to ask the Creator-Master what it was before it could answer this
creature.</p><P>Shino
raised an eyebrow behind dark glasses, wondering if the creature was
just a mimic. Well, one way to find out.</p><P>"I
am a human being. A ninja, to be exact. Who are you?"</p><P>Smiling,
as it filed away the information for later questions to the
Creator-Master, it answered, "I was given the name Aurora by my
Creator-Master. I was but a simple butterfly, until the Draught of
Life was poured onto me, giving me Life, and Soul." The
creature adored this story. It had asked its maker a thousand times
how it had been made, finding wonder in the story, and happiness in
that its Master smiled in joy when he told the story.</p><P>Shino
frowned then, and the little creature recognised that look. Its
Creator-Master had that look often when he was thinking about
something that troubled him. It often would fly in front of him then,
to distract him from such horrible thoughts. After all, what troubled
its Creator must be world-shattering.</p><P>Flittering
in front of this giant, much the same as it did for its Master, it
hoped to distract Shino from his thoughts. Shino was wondering what
gender this little thing was. Aurora...He had never heard that kind
of name before, but it seemed it would be a female name. This
creature seemed neither male nor female...Perhaps a better suited
name?</p><P>Looking
at the little thing, he held out his hand, sure it would land. It
did, and sat, watching him.</p><P>"I
will give you a name, and I'd like to see if your master would like
it better. And will you give him a message for me?"</p><P>The
little thing smiled, nodding, and began to memorise what Shino said.</p><P>"Your
name will be...Hidari. Left, it suits you. You favor your left wing. 
Now, take him this message for me: I, Shino Aburame, would like to
know who you are, to create such a magnificent insect. Please
contact me again, using this little one. He will know where to come
to give me your response. That's all in the message. When he's
replied, come back here with it, please?"</p><P>The
newly named Hidari smiled, nodding, before flitting off quickly into
the forest, dissapearing. The sudden departure made Shino wonder
just a tiny bit if he had imagined the whole thing. Surely this was
something out of a fairy tale, nothing that could happen in real
life.</p><P>Racing
back, thoughtfully, to his family's compound, Shino concentrated on
the much larger problem. It seemed almost as if the creatures of
legend were inhabiting their everyday reality now, what with that
Fox-Woman hanging around Kakashi of late.</p><P>Yes,
he knew, through her disguise, that she was oen of the kitsune. His
Kikaichu could smell the demonic chakra all around her, and writhed,
wanting to taste it, every time he got near her. She must have
sensed it as well, because she avoided him now.</p><P>But
she didn't avoid his teammates. It seemed as though she had made
friends with all of the Rookie seven, as well as Gai's team. She had
insinuated herself upon his village, and he felt a shivver of fear,
wondering what this woman's inentions were. He sensed no good
intentions on her, just as he sensed malice, ill-will, and some deep,
gouging grudge that threatened to eat her alive.</p><P>The
Aburame was no fortune-teller, he couldn't see the future, but even
he could clearly see that things were changing in Konoha. And NOT for
the better.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Naruto:

the way, I've gotten questions on why the ages seem to change every
chapter. This is simply because the author sucks at remembering the
age, or to look it up. So, I'm sorry if I've confused you all.
-Otaku)</p><P>The
day that Hidari reappeared to its Creator-Master was the very same
day that had been dreaded by all in the Kyuubi household. Few knew
what this day would entail, but all were soon alerted. The household
was awoken bright and early, something not even the reigning monarch
was used to, but dealt with.</p><P>The
entire house had been scrubbed spotless for the last several days,
and now looked even more like some fairy-tale castle built in some
misty land far away from the borders of reality. Not that that
impression was far off, considering the manner of creatures that had
made it. It was unreal, and if Naruto hadn't been dressed in robes
that made him seem almost as unreal as the castle itself, he wouldn't
have beleived it for one minute.</p><P>Placing
a hand to the gentle bulge of his stomach, his child showing through
already, he smiled, the strange aqua-and-green spider's-silk kimono
and hakama sliding against his skin. His long, silky blonde hair was
left free, framing his face in shoulder length spikes. His blue eyes
shone, as ever, in a healthy tanned face.</p><P>His
hand moved upwards, to the small, white bag nestled against his
chest. Inside were two of the most precious things in the world.
They were going to be his bond to Sasuke and Kyuubi. He had snuck
out with Tohru and Haku to go get them. Haku had picked out something
similar to give to Zabuza, and they had all laughed at the mental
image of what Zabuza would do with it.</p><P>Naruto
was nervous, but also on the lookout. He was waiting for the perfect
opportunity to give the precious gifts. Turning his head, slightly,
he caught a glimpse of the other "prince of the palace".</p><P>Sasuke
stood, his midnight eyes locked on his book, his frame supported in a
dark blue and black version of Naruto's outfit. His hair had grown
longer as well, now he was forced to wear it back, lest it get in his
way. He hated the look, for it reminded him of Itachi everytime he
looked in the mirror, but he looked as elegant and refined as ever,
yet seemed a little as if he was out of place.</p><P>Each
of them stood on opposite sides of their mate, Kyuubi no Kitsune. 
Resplendant in a fire-colored kimono and hakama, as well as a white
jacket over it, signifying his station, he stood tall and proud. His
nine tails were displayed prominently, and he looked every inch the
ruler he was, and his consorts looked equally regal.</p><P>It
took the servants breath away, but few had time to gawk. They were in
their places, and the great wooden doors were thrown wide, welcoming
in a guest that all were anxious to see leave. There stood Arashi,
the three-tailed boar.</p><P>His
grin showed off his tusks, as he moved through the hall, taking in
the splendor and oppulance with which he was greeted. His coarse
grown hair spiked, and his beady eyes moved over the ruler and his
two companions. His tails flashed quickly in and out of his robes,
just as splendid as those of the nine-tails. His whole countenance
made Naruto wish to shudder in revulsion, for he reminded him far too
much of the men in his old village, but he did not, lest he show this
beast fear.</p><P>Sasuke
looked up from his book, sparing the other lord a glance, a glare,
and then returning to his book. The Boar bristled at this insolence,
but restrained himself, lest he be...rude.</p><P>"Welcome
to my home, Lord Arashi. To what do I owe this pleasure?" 
Kyuubi's voice resounded through the hall, all the servants and the
retainers of the boar-lord turning to watch the conversation.</p><P>"Nothing
more than simple curiousity, my old friend. I had heard that after
thirteen long years, the great nine-tails, the Lord of the Kitsune
has come home, and with souveneirs, as well. Are these your mates
then? These human children?"</p><P>Kyuubi
raged inside, but he knew he must play this cool. Naruto was raging
as well, and if he was to keep the upper hand in this, he must make
sure that the dear blond one stayed silent.</p><P>"Yes,
Lord Arashi, they are my mates, as the rumors have no doubt told you.
 May I introduce to you, Lord Uchiha Sasuke, my consort, and advisor,
and Lord Uzumaki Naruto, my second consort, and the bearer of my
kit."</p><P>Raising
a spindly eyebrow at the fox, Arashi continued their verbal banter,
bowing mockingly to the two newly introduced Lords. "An honor
to meet them. However, I must mention, I see, nor smell, no mating
mark upon either of them. Are they not marked then?" The snide
remark was greeted by a gentle indent in Kyuubi's brow, indicating he
had hit a soft spot.</p><P>But
it was Sasuke who spoke up, with all the air of a weff-bred royal,
"Begging your pardon, my Lords, but my lord Kyuubi has been hard
at work righting the chaos that ensued during his long absense. We do
wish to be marked as Lord Kyuubi's mates, but the welfare of our
people comes first."</p><P>It
was amazing the effect of those words. Arashi watched as the foxes
around him grew smiles, and the entire atmosphere became one of
gentle awe and adoration. The fox-people loved these human princes!
What was going on here! It was as if, with just one statement, all
the pent up rage that had been in the room was gone! He didn't miss
the look of utter surprise and pride that Kyuubi sent to Sasuke.</p><P>Neither
did Naruto. Biting his coral lips, he did not want to be outdone,
yet unsure if he would be as well accepted. Pulling in a large
breath, Naruto moved forward, smiling softly, as he used to do for
Inari and Tsubasa, and as he seemed to be finding himself doing
increasingly.</p><P>Opening
his arms to encompass and welcome all the people in the hall, he
said, "Now, now, everyone, lets let these two lords talk in
peace." Turning to Kyuubi with a grace he wasn't sure he even
had, he bowed, and smiled, "My Lord, perhaps you and Lord Arashi
could adjourn to your reception room? If at all possible, I'd like
to feed and entertain all of our guests. I can bring food up for the
two of you, if you'd like, my lords?" Here, as if on cue, he
turned to look at the Boar King, smiling that gentle mother's smile.</p><P>The
lord wouldn't beleive it. Neither of the three lords in the room
could beleive it. It was as if...As if Naruto had been possessed or
something... Sasuke watched in awe, as the guests, including
Arashi's retainers cheered at the thought of a feast. Arashi looked
around, angry and confused that he had lost his edge so easily! He
had been one upped by a human BRAT!</p><P>Kyuubi
was shaking. His eyes were wide, and he was finding it increasingly
hard to breath. For just a moment...Just a moment, he hadn't seen
Naruto, but a smiling, soft beauty that he hadn't seen since...since
her death. He shuddered, as he tried so hard to keep from thinking
she was back. This was Naruto! Brash, rough, crass Naruto! Konoha's
number one knuckle-head ninja! This wasn't that beautiful, strong,
and gentle she-fox he had so long ago mated.</p><P>Sasuke
noticed the strange reaction Kyuubi was having, looking almost as if
he had seen a ghost. Then the raven-haired boy realised. He had, in
essence, seen the ghost of his dead mate. Sasuke and Naruto had
effectively done exactly what she would have done; defuse the scene
and then set up a better scenario. He frowned, wondering if perhaps
this was a coincidence, or if, just maybe, Kyuubi had chosen them for
the simple reason that Sasuke and Naruto combined basically WERE his
fallen mate.</p><P>Growling,
Arashi suddenly felt very much ignored. Stomping hard enough to send
cracks rippling through the floor, many of the guests let out
strangled shreiks, moving away from the growling, scowling Boar-Lord.</p><P>"I
am not here to attend some...state dinner! I am here to challenge the
Kyuubi to be sure that he still has the strength to be on the council
of the Tailed Beasts!" The demon-lord roared, his tusks making
him a fearsome sight indeed.</p><P>Naruto
frowned, his own innate arrogance answering the call, as well as a
bit of hormonal-ness.</p><P>"Now
you look here, you over grown pig! I will NOT have that kind of
violence in my home! You can fight Kyuubi all you want, and by the
way, he'll wipe the floor with your ass, but you're not doing it
tonight, so just cool your jets, jackass!"</p><P>Again,
it was as if cold water was thrown on the situation. The crowd began
laughing and cheering, the foxes and the boars all sharing in the
wonder of such a fiery "queen". However, there was one
person that was utterly incenced.</p><P>Arashi
couldn't stand it! What the hell right did this little...little
<I>whore! </I>have
to tell him to cool down! And the insult to his strength! Sneering,
he stepped forward, up the stairs, dwarfing the little blonde by
several feet, causing the blue eyed ninja to frown and narrow his
eyes.</p><P>"Alright,
if you are so sure, little queen, then perhaps you will place a wager
on it?" He sneered the title, making sure Naruto felt every inch
of the insult.</p><P>And
the blonde did. He growled low, snapping, "Yeah! I'll take any
bet you've got, pig-brain!"</p><P>Twitching
at the further insult, the Boar-king smiled, "If I win, you must
formally apologise to me for every insult you have thrown here
tonight, as well as sustain twelve lashes. If I lose, then..."</p><P>"Then
you will sustain the lashes instead, and send a gift, every month, to
Lord Naruto for the span of his life." Sasuke interrupted,
smirking. He, too, was sure that Kyuubi would wipe the floor with
this jackass. Naruto looked to the raven in surprise. He hadn't
expected Sasuke to step in.</p><P>"That's
enough! There will be no talk of lashes or bets! Arashi, if you want
your fight, you will get it tommorrow, though I see no point in it. 
Do NOT threaten my mates." Kyuubi growled, bringing order. 
Said lord just grinned.</p><P>"Ah,
but my lord, it wouldn't be interesting, if your little queen did not
participate somehow. Surely you do not doubt your own abilities so
much that you would not permit this little wager." A trap well
baited, for now Naruto had turned that straight-forward stare onto
the fox-lord, daring him to go against the blonde's will.</p><P>Groaning
inwardly, Kyuubi had to aquiesce, lest he have an angry Naruto on his
hands. Stress was bad for the kit, as well as bad for his own
sanity. Gloating to himself, Arashi grinned, shaking hands with the
blonde carrier, sealing their bet.</p><P>Sasuke
decided that the time for dramatics was just about over, so, taking a
page from Naruto's book, he stepped forward, his calm voice carrying,
and announced, "Now, let us celebrate. It has been a long, and
tiresome journey for our boar tribe friends. Let them rest, and
rejoice in the company of the fox-city."</p><P>Suddenly
energised, the kitsune moved quickly, preparing everything for their
guests. After all, their Prince had such faith that they would awe
the boars, then they must make sure his faith was not felled.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>The
banquet went well, even Arashi had to admit that. The two 'Princes'
of the fox kingdom made excellent hosts, the blonde friendly and
loud, and the raven-haired one quiet and listening. They made a
wonderful team. Arashi would have killed to gain those two as mates.
He had to admit it, he was extremely jealous of the ancient fox.</p><P>But
since when was that news? He'd always been jealous of the fool. He
didn't know how good he had it! Sesayo agreed with him, and the Snake
Lord had never lied to Arashi. They were the best of friends.</p><P>The
Boar King was given the best guest suite in the mansion, and slept
like a baby. He adored the house, and it fueled his rage, that that
twit of a red-head had gotten to be the Nine-Tailed, that his people
had gotten this realm, rather than his own. The Boars deserved it so
much more.</p><P>Standing
in the clearing the next morning, surrounded by the gossiping,
gaggling people of both Kitsunegakure, and his retainers, that rage
came to a head, as he was confronted by the Fox King.</p><P>Kyuubi
had chosen this feild, as close to a stadium as the demonic races
knew, for its openness. A clearing the size of twelve football
feilds, surrounded by dense forests, in which many levels of denizens
may watch. Many types of terrain rounded the feild, sparse trees
scattered through, a lake, this clearing was perfect for their
battle.</p><P>Stepping
forward, the two referees stood, side by side. A boarling, and a
kitling, both young, but both old enough to know when someone cheats.
 The two had spent the night bonding, becoming friends, so that it
could be ensured neither would be swayed one way or the other. 
Standing in the center, under the smiles of the two Princes, and the
stares of their combined peoples, the two began the ritual.</p><P>"It
was decided through deliberation that this would be a two part
battle. In the first part, the two competetors will show their
proficiency with their human bodies, battling while wearing their
human skins." The young vixen intoned, trying to act important,
while also staving off giggles. Looking to the boar child, she cued
him.</p><P>Continuing
where she left off, he began, "The second part of the battle
will take place whenever one of the two contestants shifts into their
beast forms. Then, it will be a battle between the two beast lords.
The first one down for a count of ten, with no signs of getting up,
will be the loser."</p><P>Stepping
to the side, the two referees, one raising their right arm, the other
their left, waited for the two combatants to enter the feild.</p><P>Kyuubi
was respledant in his fire red kimono and hakama, two short knives in
his hands. His long, red hair was pulled back from his face, resting
in a high ponytail, to keep it out of the way. He had a look of
determination in his blood red eyes, and one of regal power over his
fine features.</p><P>Arashi,
though clearly not as beautiful, was just as regal in earth toned
kimono and hakama. His sleeves were tied out of the way, and he
weilded a large axe, swinging it to and fro with ease. His muscular
body was set in a very heavy stance, and his handsome, rugged face
was sneering, his tusks shining in the light.</p><P>Hefting
the huge axe, resting it on his shoulder, Arashi looked pointedly at
his opponent. The redhead narrowed his eyes, unsure what the boar was
thinking. Suddenly, Arashi launched at Kyuubi, with far more speed
than the fox had anticipated. The crimson-eyed male had little time
to dodge out of the way, pulling a flip that would make the best
human gymnast weep for the grace of it.</p><P>The
ground cracked under the force of the titanic blow, debris shot
everywhere, Kyuubi sought to use the cover to his advantage, darting
to Arashi, and snapping a dagger towards his throat. The huge male
dodged to the left, his cheek split, just as Kyuubi landed where the
boar-lord had just been standing, retreiving his dagger from the
ground.</p><P>"Well
now, Arashi, surely you can see I'm not rusty?" Kyuubi sneered.
Furiously, the boar wiped off the blood, growling. The crowd cheered
as the two clashed again, Kyuubi dodging over the enormous axe, but
unable to land a hit.</p><P>"Get
him, Kyuu! You can do it!" Naruto called over the din, his
grin on full force. He knew his Kyuubi would win.</p><P>Kyuubi
jumped back into the forray, his speed a massive advantage over the
heavy handed boar. Arashi swung high, low, trying to score a hit,
but failing. The male growled, lunging left, just as Kyuubi dodged to
the left, scoring a long gash on Kyuubi's shoulder.</p><P>Jumping
back, the demon surveyed the damage. Growling himself, Kyuubi ran
into a problem. HE could heal it, but would that attract attention to
Naruto? Kyuubi masked the pain, unwilling to take the chance yet,
laughing. The same laugh taht sent shivvers down his subject's
spines. It was the very same laugh that said he enjoyed his own pain
as much as his enemy's. Naruto was reminded of the laughs of his
tormentors, and shuddered. Kyuubi was too into the fight to notice.</p><P>A
few more exchanges between the two fighters, and Kyuubi was dripping
blood. HE was injured, as was his opponent. The boar lord was
frustrated. Kyuubi refused to use his yokai! Damn it, Arashi knew
Kyuubi could fight better than this! Well, fine. Time to up the ante
then...</p><P>Suddenly,
grotesquely, the man began changing. Drawing out the genjutsu for the
benefit of the two "queens", his bones crunched, shifted.
His internal organs lengthened, switching places. His teeth jutted
out of his jaw, which was enlarging, just like his body. Soon, he was
huge, bigger than the Hokage tower. Thick, brown bristle-like fur
covered his body, and with a great squeal, he was the single largest
boar Sasuke had ever seen.</p><P>Kyuubi
growled to himself. He didn't want to do this, but...He had no
choice. It was in the rules. Hoping to the high ones that Naruto
wouldn't suffer any ill effects from it, he reached deep within the
boy, feeling the seal give, bending away from his advances as he
pulled on his own yokai. Using it, he added to the clone's mass,
forcing his body, much quicker, into that of his giant shape. Kyuubi
was once again that giant spirit fox that the villagers of Konoha
feared.</p><P>And
that was what shot through Naruto and Sasuke just how much of a
threat that boar really was. Kyuubi was enormous, but Arashi
overshadowed him by several stories. Had he thought even one person
would have paid attention, Naruto would have yelled out, "Cheat!"
But...As it was, everyone was too worked up.</p><P>Sasuke
however was mulling over something completely different. How in the
world would the neighboring human villages miss this?! Those beasts
were a beacon, a huge, tempting sign that said, "Look at me, I'm
over here, with a bunch of my tasty, tiny friends!" Sasuke had
to resist the urge to run, staying instead to cheer on the giant fox
that was his mate.</p><P>From
then on, the battle became savage, vicious. Kyuubi launched himself
into it with an untamed fervor, like he was hunting and going to eat
the boar-king. A flash of teeth, a clash of titanic sides, and blood
spewed the ground just feet from the two princes. They couldn't tell
who it belonged to, as the two titanic creatures continued their
tussle.</p><P>Kyuubi
could. It was his own. The huge tusks on his opponent had scored on
his flank, sinking deep, and then ripping through muscle and sinew.
He couldn't move near as well now...The boar was coming around for
another charge. Arashi could feel it. He was going to win!</p><P>Scoring
again, he sent the red fox-king flying, his tusks ripping into his
soft belly. Arashi squealed happily, dancing around the fallen fox,
sure that this was his victory, his win. He knew it!</p><P>Just
then, the fox popped up again, and...everything went black...</p><P>Kyuubi
had launched himself into the belly of the beast, driving all the air
out quickly, knocking the boar out, and technically winning. He had
won, but at what cost? The bleeding was making him woozy. He wasn't
sure if he could survive a wound so deep. His legs gave out, all
four, and he ended up falling onto the dirt.</p><P>Avoice
called through the darkness, sharp, worried.</p><P>"Kyuubi!"
Suddenly, there were hands, gently scrubbing through his bloody,
dirty fur, and they felt so good...and a face, pressed desperately
close to his muzzle. He could hear the sobs, the aching, wailing
sound.</p><P>"Kyuubi,
come on! Wake up! You have to go back to your human form! We can't
heal you if you don't!" The voice was anxious, but near calm, as
if they were used to tradgedy, and were forcing themselves to think
rationally.</p><P>Did
he? Did he really have to go back to that humanoid form, so small,
and weak? Couldn't he just die in dignity? A throb, deep in his heart
told him, no. No he couldn't die, because no matter the agony, the
seal inside Naruto's navel would keep him alive, and it prefered to
keep him in pain, as well.</p><P>He
knew he wasn't really dying. The bunshin was in pain, and near dying,
but he couldn't allow that. He had to stay in that shape. lf he
dissapeared in front of everyone, Naruto would be forfeit. They would
kill him. He'd never want that.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Naruto
was terrified. How, how was it possible?! Kyuubi looked small and
pitiful, ensconced in the huge bed in his chambers. Servants were
coming and going every hour, bringing various herbs and salves, and
such, while the elder foxes tried to work healing on the Lord. But
it wasn't working! Naruto could feel the life force in the bunshin
fading. He didn't know what would happen if Kyuubi kept his tenacious
hold on the bunshin when it faded...</p><P>"Naruto-dono!"
A voice cried out from the doorway, and Tsubasa ran towards his
little lord. Naruto welcomed the boy, holding him, as he tried to
stay calm, to think of what he could do. Tsubasa had never seen the
blonde like this. He was always so warm, and nice. Now...Now he was
shaking, and tears were swimming in his sea-blue eyes. It was as if
the world was going to end if Kyuubi-sama didn't make it.</p><P>Sasuke
couldn't watch. He stood in the hallway, listening to the bustle in
the room. He knew Kyuubi wouldn't die. He couldn't. So long as the
seal was intact, he couldn't die unless Naruto did. So Kyuubi
couldn't die, not like his mother and father. Not like everyone else.</p><P>Right?</p><P>Tsubasa
watched, as the tension in the castle built for three days. Kyuubi
continued to lay, near death, in his gigantic bed. Because of the
danger to their lord, his teachers had allowed him to stay with the
distraught shinobi. He was close at hand, watching, as Naruto stayed
on Kyuubi's bed with him, talking to him, telling him to come back,
to stop being a wimp. He watched as Sasuke glanced into the room a
thousand times a day, hoping for some change, but unable to stand
staying around, waiting for it.</p><P>Was
this what love meant? Being in constant fear that your loved one
would die? Wishing so badly, that you could take their place, as he
had heard Naruto say over and over?</p><P>When
he had asked his mother what love was, she had smiled, and said,
"You'll understand when you're grown." Did he understand
now? If this was what love was, was it really something he wanted?</p><P>But
then he remembered all the good times. All the laughter between
Naruto-dono and Kyuubi-dono. All the mock-brawls between Sasuke-sama
and Naruto-dono. Was that what love was? Fun? Joy? Happiness? or was
it sorrow? Decay? and Torment?</p><P>He...didn't
know...He didn't know if he wanted to know.</p><P>He
entered upon one scene however, that proved that maybe...just maybe,
it was worth all the pain. That love was quite worth it.</p><P>He
had been sent to retreive some things from Naruto's room, so that he
could remain with Kyuubi, should the lord wake. Upon arriving back
at the red-heads quarters, he heard a joyous shout. Running to find
out what was going on, he found Naruto weeping, hugging the prone
body of Kyuubi.</p><P>"Kyuu!
Oh, god! Don't you EVER scare me like that again, you stupid,
arrogant fox!" Naruto was yelling, tears of joy streaming down
his face, along the whisker-marks. Said fox was laughing, presumably
at the boy's worry, holding on tightly to the little shinobi. There
was a light in Kyuubi's eyes, one of joy, and sorrow at the same
time, as he looked at Naruto.</p><P>Sasuke
hurried in, calling, "I just heard, is he really awake?"</p><P>Kyuubi
looked over the mop of blonde hair attached to his chest, and grinned
at the raven-haired male. "Yeah, seems I am!" He laughed. 
Sasuke was stoic, but as he turned away, you could see just a hint of
his releif under the curtain of his long hair. He stood by the bed,
watching Naruto and Kyuubi chat about all that had happened in the
last three days.</p><P>"So,
Arashi really left?" Kyuubi said, utterly astonished.</p><P>"Yup.
He wasn't nearly as badly hurt as you, but his pride was totalled.
You beat him, Kyuubi, and thanks to you, I'll be getting a present
from that big boar every month from now on! But...He skipped out on
the whipping, though..." The blonde pouted, even as Kyuubi
roared with laughter. It was good to be alive. It was good to have
his little mates there for him.</p><P>After
the mandatory checks, all the other foxes left the three alone, and
once they were gone, Naruto broke down. He hid behind his sleeve,
sitting by Kyuubi's side on the utterly enormous bed, crying the
tears he hadn't been able to while Kyuubi was asleep. He really let
lose, crying his heart out, and trying to appologise for it!</p><P>Kyuubi
smiled gently, stroking the blonde's hair, "Naru-chan, come on
now. It's not like I died, or anything!" That earned him a whack
on the chest, to which he winced. He tried again, "Come on,
Naruto, I'm here, and I'm alive. You don't have to hide your tears
from me, I know you're crying anyway!"</p><P>"Yeah,
we could hear it all the way down the hall." Sasuke teased.</p><P>"Shut
up, teme!" Naruto grouched, drying his tears. He smiled, a
radiant smile, just like the sun coming out from behind a curtain of
rainclouds. Leaning forward, he placed a gentle, sweet kiss on
Kyuubi's lips. It was just one, and a soft one, but it was there. 
Kyuubi felt a burst of emotion in his chest, a fountain of thoughts
that burst from it (No, no perverted ones...Jeeze...-Otaku).</p><P>"I
meant it, Fox. Don't you ever leave me that worried again. After all,
we're mates...Right?" Naruto said, pulling the treasure from his
breast, the small white pouch containing the objects of his love. 
Pulling them out, he nestled them in the palm of his hands, one each.
"Or you, Sasuke! I don't want to have to worry about you
either!" He said, a stubborn pout on his lips.</p><P>Kyuubi
and Sasuke both were awed by the gifts. Sitting in the palm extended
to Sasuke was a silver ring, with ornate, delicately carved waves
coalescing around the band and a bright turquoise stone in the
center. In the palm extended to Kyuubi, was a matching earring,
another, equal, blue stone dangling from the hoop of it.</p><P>In
tandem, the two males took their intended gifts, as Naruto smiled on
them, like some benevolent god. Kyuubi had no words, and for once,
Sasuke was sputtering, unable to form any. Naruto giggled a little,
the solemn, sweet atmosphere utterly broken.</p><P>"Well,
now, Naru-chan! This is a little sudden, don't you think? I
mean...Jeeze..." Kyuubi joked, only to be hit upside the head
again.</p><P>"I...I
have nothing in return to give you, Naruto. You should know that."
Sasuke said, turning his back. His hand clutched at the ring,
hoping...Maybe, maybe, Naruto would let him keep it?</p><P>"I
know, Sasuke. But, until we can get back into Konoha, and you can get
to your precious clan district, I figure I can wait." Naruto
said, brushing it off. He caught a glimpse of the utter surprise in
Sasuke's eyes. "What? You expected me to take back my proposal,
just cause you can't reciprocate with your clan's symbol? Please!
Like I'm that shallow!" (Wow, Naruto knows a big word! -Otaku)</p><P>Both
Sasuke and Kyuubi looked on in utter surprise, but for very different
reasons. Sasuke, because Naruto was being much more understanding
than he had thought, and Kyuubi because he had no idea what they
meant by Sasuke's clan symbol. Ah well, he was sure he'd get an
explanation sometime. However, for now, he had a really nice scene
in front of him...</p><P>Sasuke
had stepped forward, embracing the little Kyuubi container, kissing
him fervently, a smile on his face like no one had seen since his
brother had destroyed his family. Naruto was utterly shocked,
totally void of any reaction. He had never expected this kind of
reaction to his gifts...</p><P>"Alright,
then, if we're going to do this, then I had better do it
properly...Come here, you two." Kyuubi said, something
indiscernable in his voice. The two glanced at each other, before
coming close enough to touch Kyuubi. Sasuke even sacreficed his pride
and crawled up onto the bed, so that he could sit next to Kyuubi on
the opposite side of Naruto.</p><P>Kyuubi
pulled them both close, in a one armed hug on both, wincing a bit as
they accidentally landed on his poor wounded stomach. But he bore
down on the pain. Looking into their bright, questioning eyes, he, if
but for a second, questioned if it was the right thing to do. To bind
these boys to him forever. Would they regret it later? Or...</p><P>But
that passed, and he said, softly, "This will probably hurt. What
I'm going to do, is bite you, and inject each of you with a special
type of yokai. The scar it leaves will be the mating mark that will
prove to all of demon kind that we are mated." Here he paused,
and then an explosive grin appeared on his face, "Normally, this
would happen in the middle of mind-blowing sex, but hey, what can you
do?" For which, he received two bonks on the head, one each
from a fuming</p><P>Naruto
and an embarassed Sasuke.</p><P>"Now...Just
hold still..." he said, after they had calmed down, pulling
first Sasuke closer. His reasoning on this choice was, if Naruto saw
exactly what was going to happen to him, he wouldn't freak out over
it. Pulling the dark-haired boy into an embrace, he first, slowly,
kissed the boy into submission. Even Sasuke had to admit that it was
a MUCH better kiss than his first.</p><P>Then,
while the avenger was dazed, Kyuubi nipped and nibbled his way down
Sasuke's throat, coaxing his way across the porcelain skin, causing
shivvers to erupt from both Sasuke and Naruto's body. Slowly, he
reached the point where he would place the mating mark, the junction
of Sasuke's neck and shoulder. Kissing softly there, he then,
quickly, bit down, hard, with his sharp canines, drawing out blood
and a deep, painful groan from the boy beneath him. But, like the
ninja he was, Sasuke didn't flinch, or balk. He accepted the pain.</p><P>Then,
Naruto was next. Kyuubi went through much the same ritual, but found
that as soon as he came to the spot where he was to bite, Naruto
would tense up, and that was no good...So, kicking slowly back up the
neck, he nibbled a bit on the blonde's ear, to stave off any tensing,
and then, suddenly, bit down, just as hard on the junction, forming
the mating mark.</p><P>"HEY!!"
Naruto cried out, undignified at being tricked so. However,
strangely, the pain was soothing, like something that a mother would
give to a child to help it sleep. It was...addicting. Naruto felt
strangely disturbed that he had even thought that, but couldn't help
nagging doubts...</p><P>"There,
now. You two are claimed. We'll never have to worry about jackasses
like Arashi saying that you aren't marked, ever again." Kyuubi
grinned, pulling his new mates in close. They were stiff, but soon,
the two, first the blonde, then the raven, settled, and curled in
towards him. He felt near complete, with his two lifemate's within
arms reach. Content, he heard the slow winding down, as the two
boys, long exhausted from worry, slept. It wasn't the deep sleep a
commoner can get, but rather the healthy, gaurded sleep that shinobi
train to acheive, and cannot override.</p><P>They
slept well that night, all three of them, all together, for the first
night of their "marriage". It was restoring, and priceless
for the two who had long since lost any feeling of family outside
present company.</p><P>End

<br><br><h3>Chapter 12</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
Hey, everybody, how y'all doing? Anyway, this is the next instalation
of the Kits! Saga. Trust me, you might want to get out a hanky now,
because it gets bad...</p><P>Kits!</p><P>Pairings:
Wow...Okay, NaruKyuuSasuGaaShuka, plus some IruKaka, and just a
smidge of ShinoOc. Also, there are going to be some really cracky
Sakura/? Pairings, but their only for the plot, not for anything
else! (Please don't eat me alive! -Otaku) and plus I'm going to start
pairing off the Rookie Nine.</p><P>Warnings:
Lots of political stuff, but its played down, so as not to bore you
all. Also, we've got some character death, but most of them die
anyway in the original, so...Anywho. We've also got Evil!Sakura, and
just a twinge of creepiness on her part...</p><P>Description:
Sasuke and Naruto get thrown headfirst into their duties as princes
of the foxes, while Tohru and Shino continue their penpal relations.
Naruto learns an awesome new skill! Meanwhile, at Konoha, several
people are dying, and no one can find any connections...</p><P>Disclaimer:
If I owned Naruto, then you definately wouldn't see me writing this,
because this would BE the Naruto series. Anywho...</p><P>(Oh,
and I just found out a couple of days ago that the three-tails was
actually a turtle, not a boar...Oh well...I got the second one right,
anyway!</p><P>Also,
for ages, see last chapter. I'm not changing them again. Nor am I
repeating myself. I have a hard enough time keeping track of what all
the characters are doing, let alone what age they are!</p><P>-Otaku)</p><P>Kits!
Chapter 12</p><P>Naruto
had been bored. Now, he was swamped. It seemed that since Kyuubi was
busy healing, and dealing with extremely important business such as
the various treaties with the other countries, both human and demon,
that he and Sasuke were left to deal with internal matters! They were
inundated with requests for financial aid, marital disputes,
territory disputes, and gods only know what else these silly kitsune
come up with!</p><P>Sasuke
wasn't finding it too appealing either. But, where as Naruto could
deal with sudden incurrences on his personal space, Sasuke's method
was to simply hold court once a week, and if they needed something
they could bring it to him then. He couldn't deal with it like
Naruto, who was getting accosted on his walks around the city,
various complaints and such, that the blonde, though often short
tempered, dealt with with efficiency and stamina.</p><P>One
such request actually forced Sasuke to rely on a method he felt a
little too close to his brothers. A guard had come forth, holding a
baby kit, barely born. A vixen as well as a male came forth, both
claiming it. The vixen said that since she birthed it, it was hers,
and the male said that he was half the parents as well, so it was
his.</p><P>Naruto
was at a loss of what to do. He didn't really want to remove the
child from either one of it's parents. The poor thing needed a good
home! He didn't want to see it hurt, and it was just a baby!</p><P>Sasuke
understood the arguments on both sides, and surely there was a way to
solve this. Taking a page out of his brother's book, he fixed them
both with a stare, before declaring, "Take the child, and cut it
in two. Give one half to each parent."</p><P>The
cries of utter revulsion came from all, and Sasuke was treated to a
disgusted glare from Naruto.</p><P>"Have
you gone out of your teeny Avenger mind?!" Naruto yelled, "How
is that going to do anything but put an innocent child to death?!"</p><P>"Just
do it." Sasuke said, calm as always. He turned to Naruto, "This
is the only way to be fair. They both had a hand in making the child,
and they both obviously love their child, so this is the only method
available to us."</p><P>The
male nodded, saddened, but willing to accept the Prince's judgement.
The vixen, wild eyed, clutched the child to her breast. She looked
around, hoping for someone to help her.</p><P>"No!
I'd rather see my child raised by that male, than to see him harmed!
Please! I'll give him to him, just...Just don't harm my child!"
She yelled, hoping to appeal to the prince's sense of mercy. Naruto
froze. He could stop this, just as easily as Sasuke had started it,
but...Who should he give the child to?</p><P>It
seemed a simple answer to him. And apperantly, it was to Sasuke as
well, for Sasuke turned to him, with that quiet Uchiha smile, and
nodded, allowing him the descision. He turned to the two, and began
walking towards them. Taking the baby from the mother, and in gentle
arms, holding the cooing child, the golden haired prince smiled at
the kit.</p><P>"This
will one day be a full grown fox. Until then, it needs all the love,
and compassion it can handle. You two are his parents! You shouldn't
fight amongst each other! If this had been a human child, I would
say you two should work it out, but this child will need to learn all
the essential Kitsune culture, as well. You, madame, " He said,
turning to the vixen, "are a sweet, kind woman, and I can tell
you truly love your child. You would rather see it in another's arms
than hurt. I commend you for that. And you sir, " he said,
turning now to the male, "are a brave individual, willing to
sacrifice your own child, should your prince demand it. I appreciate
that kind of loyalty. So, as Lord Kyuubi's mate, I award custody of
this child to both of you. You will share him, and teach him
properly. And hopefully, you two will learn something from each other
as well. Good luck."</p><P>And,
finally finished, Naruto kissed the babe on the forehead, smiling
down at the child, before handing him back to his parents, who
hopefully, would learn to live peacefully with each other, for the
sake of their child.</p><P>Many
more cases, just as harrowing as this one, appeared before the two
princes, and, slowly, over the weeks, they began to become used to
their noble duties. Naruto, pregnant still, actually enjoyed having
something to do, since training was becoming harder. He found it
nearly impossible to move with the same speed and accuracy he had had
before his growing babe.</p><P>He
endured, however, and perservered. He only hoped he wasn't doing
damage to the baby.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>While
his "Princess" was training, Tohru often had little to do. 
However, he found that this was a perfect time to reply to the
strange shinobi's request. He was rather peeved, especially since
the interloper had even suggested he change Aurora's name to Hidari! 
This was severely intriguing. Especially since when Tohru had lived
in the leaf-village, there had seemed no ninja who would show any
interest in a dying child.</p><P>"Aurora,
I give you the freedom to choose. Whichever name you choose will suit
me fine." He whispered to the little creature. Those liquid
purple eyes never left it's Creator-Master's face.</p><P>"I...Well,
Master, I was wondering if perhaps, I could have a companion? Then we
could use one name for him and the other for me?" Aurora had
been apprehensive bringing this up to it's dear Master. It wasn't
sure what using the Water of Life cost it's Creator, and it didn't
want it's Master to suffer.</p><P>Tohru
was surprised. He wasn't even sure what gender this creature was,
much less if it could reproduce, yet here it was asking for a
companion. He couldn't deny it, especially since the little voice
had sounded so very lonely while it spoke. He failed to imagine what
it would be like, to be the only one of your kind. He was saddened
by it.</p><P>"Alright,
little one. Find me a suitable butterfly for you, and I will create
you a Life-Companion." He smiled, unknowingly creating a small
culture for the little creatures, just speaking those words. Tohru
wondered what he would do, if the two procreated. If he had created
an entirely new species. He wondered what that would do to the
world.</p><P>It
was a few days before Aurora brought back a beautiful, red and yellow
winged butterfly, rather flighty in nature. Tohru commended his
creation on a beautiful choice of companion. Taking out his flask of
the Water, he poured just the tiniest bit on the butterfly, and both
he and Aurora watched as it worked it's magic.</p><P>The
little being grew, twisting, changing, slowly, almost painfully. 
It's legs collided, solidifying and combining, to form arms and legs,
tiny, but perfectly working. It's tiny hands clenched in pain as the
rest of it formed, it's legs, body, and finally, it's head. The same
tiny ears, long, and pointed, grew, and soon became shrouded by
short, fire-red hair, spiked as if styled somehow. The little
creature blinked open large, liquid, pupiless green eyes, and looked
around. Fluttering it's beautiful flame-designed wings, it opened
it's tiny mouth, as if seeking to talk.</p><P>Aurora
fluttered down next to it, and smiled. It was strange, seeing two
such similar, and yet so different creatures standing next to each
other on his hand. Where Aurora was a feminine androgyny, the newly
born Hidari was rather masculing looking. Aurora's skin was a light,
sparkling green, matching it's beautiful peacocklike wings, Hidari's
skin was a bright yellow color. Aurora's long, soft blue hair was
more elegent and refined, where Hidari's was sharp, and pointed.</p><P>"Happy
Birthday, Hidari." Tohru said, smiling down at his new creation.
 Aurora took Hidari's hand, which caused the little thing to look at
it's companion strangely. "Now, do not fear, Hidari, Aurora is
your Life-Companion. You two were created as equals. You are safe
here, with myself and with Aurora."</p><P>Those
green eyes turned on Tohru and a questioning look appeared on his
face. It seemed Hidari wouldn't be one to talk much...</p><P>"He
is our Creator-Master, Hidari! We owe him our very existance. He
created us with the Water of Life. We...We are Aurora and Hidari,
the first of our kind!" Aurora announced, happy and proud. 
However, this left Tohru with a slight problem. He didn't know what
to call these creatures. Now that there were two of them, they needed
a name for their species.</p><P>Finally,
after a few days deliberation, he decided to call them Faeries, after
the old Fairy tales. They certainly resembled the little nature
spirits that tricked and traded with humans. Informing them of this,
Aurora smiled, and fluttered around her Creator-Master's head, and
Hidari smiled as well, but stayed firmly planted on his creator's
shoulder.</p><P>Now,
Tohru knew their genders for sure, because something in their
chemical makeup had changed during the days they spent with each
other. Hidari, for lack of a better term, grew genitals, and Aurora
gained mamory glands on her chest, much like those of a female human.
 It was because of this that Tohru managed to find some small
handkerchiefs around the castle, and give them to the little beings. 
They accepted them graciously, and turned them into small, rather
barbaric outfits, usually dresses for Aurora, and some form of tunic
for Hidari.</p><P>One
day, after Hidari had been born, Aurora came to her Master, dressed
in an elegant, if somewhat ripped gown of blue-green silk, and
flitted in front of him. Tohru turned to the little creature, and
waited for her to speak up.</p><P>"Aren't
you going to answer Master Shino's message?" She asked. Tohru
found himself a bit urked that she had called him that.</p><P>"Alright,
Aurora, I'll answer. Repeat the message to me again?"</p><P>"'I,
Shino Aburame, would like to know who you are, to create such a
magnificent insect. Please contact me again, using this little one. 
He will know where to come to give me your response.' End message."
She intoned, before resting on her master's knee, waiting for the
response.</p><P>"Alright,
I'll reply, but I want both you and Hidari to go this time, and I
want you to stay for a full day, and then I want you, Aurora to
return with the message. Hidari will stay, in case he forgets
something he wanted to put in the message. Then, when I reply, you
two will stay there for another day, and then switch, Hidari
delivering his message that time. Do you understand?"</p><P>She
nodded, and smiled. She would hate to be away from her beloved
Hidari, but they would obey. Tohru was their Creator after all.</p><P>"Here's
the message. Are you ready?" At a nod, he began. "I am
Tohru, and that is all you need to know. I created these beings to
help me. Why are you so interested in my Faeries? Surely, you, as a
ninja, have better things to do. Aurora will deliver your message to
me, and Hidari will stay with you, should you need anything. When
Aurora returns with my message to you, send Hidari with the reply the
next day, alright? I look forward to hearing from you. That's the
end of the message, Aurora." She nodded, and recited it again
for him. Tohru was always amazed at how much these little beings
could memorise in one sitting. It was astounding.</p><P>"Hidari
and I will leave in the morning to deliver the message, Master."
She said, smiling again. She couldn't wait to watch what passed
between her Creator and Master Shino. Finding her Life-Companion
sleeping under a flower, she woke him and told him of their mission. 
They began gathering things they would need, and in the morning,
left, silently as the wind they rode.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Meanwhile,
Sakura was becoming rather notorious. It seemed as if she was simply
becoming a Lolita icon, dating older men, starting with Ibiki Morino
(I think that's his name...-Otaku), the interogations head. He was
in charge of gathering information from the various spies the ANBU
manage to catch.</p><P>That
is, until he turned up dead, two weeks after he began dating Sakura. 
No one could really explain his death. He was found in a ditch, a
few blocks away from Sakura's house, and it was deduced that he was
coming to see her, from the flowers he had in his hand. His dead
body was just staring off into space, rather disconcertingly, as if
he died happy. Had they not been ANBU, his finders would have
sobbed, at the loss of such a fine shinobi.</p><P>At
the funeral, Sakura was seen being comforted by Asuma, who, everyone
knew, was having a rocky time with Kurenai. Of her sensei, no one
knew. He had for lack of a better term, dissapeared. No one had
seen him since his and Iruka's break up, except in the company of the
red-headed kunoichi that no one really knew. Iruka was at the
funeral, and though several gossip mongers tried to pry information
out of him, he was tight-lipped, and utterly silent. It was strange.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Kyuubi,
trying to reconnect with his youngest mate, had sought the blonde
out, hoping to gain some favor with him. He found the little blonde
trying his hardest to train, even while the child in his belly made
it rather hard for him.</p><P>"Naru-chan,
I...Let's train together!" He said, grabbing Naruto into a huge
hug. The blonde griped at him, but sooner or later, relaxed into the
hug. Naruto was actually rather happy that Kyuubi wasn't too busy
with his work. He had missed the fox's constant presence, though
they still chatted through the seal, it was less frequent now.</p><P>"Alright!
Alright, Kyuubi, just settle down." The blonde grinned, pushing
the fox-man away from himself. Setting into a stance, he initiated a
spar between the two, and it just took off from there.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Just
months after Ibiki was found dead, so too was Asuma Sarutobi. He
too, was found in a ditch, as if going to see Sakura, with candy,
this time. And again, he seemed happy to have died. It was strange,
of course, but no one, in the whole shinobi village could find any
information to implicate the pink haired shinobi who sobbed at the
two's funerals.</p><P>Rumors
began flying, varying stories. Some said a demon had a grudge against
Sakura, and was punishing her for being vain. Some said Sakura was
the demon, and was feeding off the men. Others said that she was just
plain bad luck, and anyone who stayed in contact with her would die
as well. And still others blamed it on the Kyuubi, one last dying
strike against the village it had tortured.</p><P>Even
so, Sakura earned herself the title of "the Cherry Blossom
Widow". She secretly loved the name, though she outwardly
protested it being used. She wanted to be feared, to be loved, as
her mistress was. Her teacher was beautiful, deadly, and utterly
uncatchable, and she wanted to be the same.</p><P>How
else would she steal back Sasuke from that damn bastard? (hm...does
this remind anyone else of the Shippuuden arch? Or is it just me?
-Otaku)</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Naruto
was learning quickly, even Kyuubi had to admit. It had taken him over
two hundred years to learn this technique, as simple as it was, and
his little mate had it down within two weeks! Though, he had to
admit, with as fine a teacher as him, he would've learned it a lot
faster too. And, the boy had natural talent, shifting his
conciousness to work with the 'jutsu' as he called it, allowing his
mind to figure out the inherant parts of it.</p><P>He
was doing so well...Yet, Kyuubi would still sense a turmoil, in his
heart and mind, sometimes. Whenever Kyuubi got too close, or touched
him, he would feel a tremor of fear run through the little
Jinchuuriki. It made him sad, and angry, to think that Naruto might
fear him. But he knew that the little one couldn't help it.</p><P>He
had thought that teaching him the Fuin no Kaze would help. Maybe
learning the Wind Seal would help him to calm, to steady himself. 
Kyuubi had known for years that Naruto was a Wind User. He had the
personality for it, the mind for it. He was quick, flighty, utterly
fascinated with the world around him, and rather uncontrollable.</p><P>So
perhaps, learning a technique to put him in contact with his own
nature would help the boy to alleviate some of his fears. It seemed
to be working, but only time will tell...</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>The
third Hokage was no fool. Nor was he prone to ignoring a situation,
especially if it posed a threat to the village he loved and
protected. He had hoped that by using that damnable vixen they would
perhaps locate their own errant fox, and then return him home. Then,
perhaps, they could have been rid of her.</p><P>But
now, after all the damage she was causing, he had no choice. He had
to make her leave. She was a threat, and she was destroying his
home, his people, one by one.</p><P>She
had destroyed Kakashi, taking away the only thing he had loved, since
he lost Obito.</p><P>She
had compromised Iruka's ability to teach, simply by putting his heart
into the shredder.</p><P>She
was corrupting, corroding away at Sakura's soul, turning her into a
ruthless she-demon, much like herself.</p><P>She
was slowly eating away at the sanity of several of the Genin, among
them: Hyuuga Hinata, who she was poisoning with false sympathy;
Hyuuga Neji, who she was slowly devouring his trust in all; Inuzuka
Kiba, who was slowly losing control on the tenuous balance his family
keeps between the wild of the animals, and the humanity of his soul;
and finally, she was destroying Akimichi Chouji, and Nara Shikamaru,
by raising doubts about their own friendship.</p><P>And
worse still, he knew in the reaches of his heart, she was responsible
for the death of his son. However indirectly.</p><P>All
he could do was watch, as the beginning stages took root. But now,
before this evil flower blossomed, he could uproot it, and drive it
out of his beautiful leaf garden. He would drive the she-fox out,
turn her away, whether they found the fox-village or not.</p><P>These
were his thoughts that night, that fateful last night. These were
his thoughts as his Anbu fell, silently, to the illusions of a master
vixen. These were the images, the rants that filled his mind, as she
snuck into his office, where he was finishing up the remnants of the
day's paperwork.</p><P>Sensing
the presence, he turned, quickly, armed. He was a shinobi, though
old, and would go down fighting. Or so he thought.</p><P>It
was Orochimaru. Young, sweet, before he had been corrupted with
thoughts of experiments, and immortality. This was the child he had
nearly raised, after the war had taken his parents, after the academy
had turned out yet another child prodigy. This...was his student,
his failure.</p><P>But,
he was too young...Even now, he would be fifty or
more...Surely...This was some trick?</p><P>Before
he could call out, new gaurds burst through the door, only they saw
an Orochimaru much older, in his thirties, with his kunai at the
Hokage's throat. They stayed their hands. The snake-summoner had
their leader, whom they had sworn to protect.</p><P>Orochimaru
gave one last grin, his long, slimy tongue sliding down the old man's
cheek, and whispered in his ear, "It's been fun, old man. But
your time is up."</p><P>Blood
sprayed everywhere, as the jugular was sliced open. The poison on
the blade quickly took it's toll, stopping the elder's heart before
he had even bled to death. Before his killer had even fled the room,
through a window.</p><P>Laughing
out, in his voice, Tsumi called out, "Sound will DESTROY Konoha!
 Wait for us, for we will strike, fearsome and swift!"</p><P>And
the snake-master dissapeared.</p><P>End

<br><br><h3>Chapter 13</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
Okay, now we're getting into the meat of the story. This is where it
starts getting interesting. For all you who have been waiting so
patiently, this chapter contains:</p><P>THE
BIRTH!!!</p><P>Kits!</p><P>Pairings:
NaruKyuuSasuGaaShuka, as well as IruKaka, and some ShinoOc. I've
also decided to put in some ShikaChou. I'm sorry but I just love
those two, as a pairing.</p><P>Warnings:
 Complications, birth, sneak attacks, and quite a bit of insanity. I
intend to start showing some of what the Rookie Nine and Gai's Team
are doing. This is gonna get hectic.</p><P>Description:
 The seventh tail has decided to visit, and Naruto's having some
problems with his kit. Also, Shikamaru is noticing a bunch of
strange occurences around his friends, and some changes in each's
personality. What can he do about it? And why is Shino talking to
himself?!</p><P>Disclaimer:
I no own Naruto. If I did, Naruto's abuse would be public knowledge,
and all those involved would be punished severely.</p><P>Run
Away Chap. 13</p><P>Kyuubi
was utterly surprised to find the seven tails on his doorstep. Not
only that, but with a very small entourage, and no announcement. Had
it not been Sesayoi, he would have growled. But being that it was in
fact the snake demon, he had to be extra careful.</p><P>He
remembered back when the nine of them had ascended, had gained their
titles. While he had been a trickster, and relied on human stupidity
to sheild his people, Sesayoi had used every form of treachery to
carve out his kind's domain among the ashes of former human kingdoms.
 Kyuubi knew he could take him in a one on one fight, but he doubted
it would come to that. The snake lord was far too sneaky for that.</p><P>Now,
with a heavily pregnant Naruto and a dangerously sinister snake-lord
living in the same house, Kyuubi was on edge, constantly.</p><P>The
start of it all was when Sesayoi showed up. He hadn't sent word, but
the kitsune gaurd had noticed, and sent news of his arrival ahead, so
that their Lord could get everything situated. They had even
attempted to place the incoming party in a maze-illusion, but that
failed miserably.</p><P>So,
when the seven tail finally made it to his palace, Kyuubi greeted
him, his two mates standing at his side, Sasuke helping Naruto to
stay steady, for the pregnancy was weighing heavily upon the male's
hips. He had a tendency to fall over, recently, so he usually stayed
in bed. Now, however, since another lord had come for a visit, he
was required by curtesy, to be there to greet him.</p><P>It
annoyed Naruto to all hell, and had he not been in quite a bit of
backpain, and trying to stifle groans, he would have cursed the snake
lord.</p><P>Sesayoi
was a beautiful man, with long, silver hair, the same color as his
animal form, that reached to his ankles, and was kept in a neglected
ponytail that had slid halfway down his back. He was dressed in a
simple forest green kimono, with snake-scale chestplate, and
gauntlets. He didn't wear hakama, which made his outfit look all the
more feminine, along with his pale skin. His dark eyes were
mesmerising, and Sasuke was almost caught before he remembered what
Kyuubi had warned them about.</p><P>"Don't
look in Sesayoi's eyes. He's just like a snake, and can charm a
person with just his eyes." The fox-lord had warned them. 
Naruto had no problems avoiding his eyes, because he was too busy
trying not to hurl. He was finding out quickly that pregnancy was
not a fun thing.</p><P>Their
guest's eyes widened at the sight of such a beautiful, pregnant male
beside his old comrade. He smiled, a slow, oily smile that was so
common in his people. He now knew a way to test Kyuubi. And test it
would be.</p><P>"Ah,
my dear old friend, how are you?" He spoke, soft, and sweet,
though poison hid under his words.</p><P>"Well,
Sesayoi, and you?" Kyuubi could barely keep the growl from his
voice, but he smiled just as concealing a smile as Sesayoi's. It was
a silent battle, a fight of two wills, and all felt it. Naruto's kit
gave a kick, in response, causing Naruto to gasp.</p><P>"I
see your child is as healthy as his father, eh, Kyuubi?" 
Sesayoi said, turning that smile upon the blonde.</p><P>"Yes,
and quite a handful, too!" Naruto growled out, through the pain.
 The court laughed, sure that if the mother could joke about the pain
now, it was going to be a fine child.</p><P>"The
bearer is strong, and the child will be too. I am...appreciative of
your concern. My servants will show you and your entourage to your
rooms. After you are settled, dinner will be announced. We will all
be in attendance, and hope that you can put aside the weariness from
your travels to join us." Kyuubi said, making it less a hope,
and more an order. Sesayoi wasn't stupid. Nor was he deaf. He knew
what would happen should he not appear.</p><P>He
would lose face, in this battle. That was unnacceptable. So, he
followed the lowly servants out of the sun-drenched chamber, and down
the winding corridors of the tree-castle, to his apartments, that,
though sumptuous, had a thrown-together feel.</p><P>"Naruto,
are you alright?" Sasuke asked, once the slimy snake bastard was
out of the hall. Naruto kept wincing, every few minutes, and as far
as Sasuke knew that wasn't normal in pregnancies.</p><P>"No,
dammit! This kid is determined to tear me in HALF!!" Naruto
growled, curling around his enlarged abdomen. He knew this wasn't
normal either, but he was in too much pain to be scared. It felt as
if the child was tearing at his belly, kicking and clawing.</p><P>Kyuubi
came over, and placing his hands on the swollen womb, he pulsed a
little bit of his demonic aura around the fetus. This seemed to calm
the child, still its movements. It was the only thing that really
worked, he had noticed. Something about the deep red chakra just
soothed the child within Naruto.</p><P>Tohru
came forward, helping the young male to waddle out to a garden. The
air was gentle, and the weak fall sunshine shone in through the hole
in the bark above them. The plants moved softly, and the entire air
of the place was soothing, and calming. Naruto breathed a sigh of
releif. Hopefully, the surroundings would influence his child to
sleep.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Ever
since his sensei's death, Shikamaru has had no one to play Shogi
with. But now, now he felt as if he were on the board, as if he was
one of the peices. He wasn't sure which one he would be considered,
but...</p><P>Things
were moving, fast, and he didn't like the way they were moving. The
entire board seemed to be under the control of someone, or something
else. It didn't help that there was an enemy queen on his side of the
feild, and they had just lost king. Now, they needed to find a new
one, quick, before the sound ninja attacked again.</p><P>The
assasination of the hokage was a terrible, and much greived
occurence. They had had trouble finding a replacement. Within the
months after his death, the council had sought out Jiraiya, one of
the legendary Sannin, hoping he would take the position, but he
turned it down. Instead, he went on a mission to find Tsunade, his
fellow Sannin, who eventually did take the position.</p><P>Tsunade,
when she took the throne, refused to cancel the Chuunin exams, simply
because she didn't want to lost face in front of the other villages.
After all, their ally, the Sand Village, was coming. There was no
way they could cancel it.</p><P>Even
worse, they had all found out the reason the third hokage had sought
to get that dumbass Naruto back. After Sarutobi's death, the fifth
hokage had felt no need to keep the secrecy. It was widly
acknowledged and talked about.</p><P>Naruto
was the Kyuubi.</p><P>Now,
that was something Shikamaru hadn't seen coming. Sure, the boy was
stupid, and utterly too loud, but he wasn't demonic. He wasn't a
monster. If he was, he would have destroyed them all, already. So it
made little sense.</p><P>But
for some reason, even sweet, personable Chouji believed him to be the
evil fox that had attacked their village. He had never considered
that Chouji might be that...judgemental. Yeah, he had lost his
mother to that beast, but they had all lost loved ones. The little
blonde hadn't caused that destruction, but it seemed everyone was
willing to blame him.</p><P>He
could see a much more immenent threat, and it stood right in front of
the little shop he was currently sharing barbeque with his team in. 
She was the buxom, red-headed new Jounin that had appeared just
before the Sandaime's assassination. The strangest thing was, she
wasn't under suspicion for the attack. It appeared the Sandaime had
given her asylum, and given her Konoha-nin status.</p><P>He
didn't trust her. Shino avoided her too, and he was just as smart as
Shikamaru. Something was wrong with this woman, and he had no idea
what it could be. He didn't want to bring it up, however, since most
seemed really taken with her. He had to admit, she was quite
charming.</p><P>Chouji
talked about her, more and more now. It was causing Shikamaru just a
bit of pain, to hear his dearest person talking about that
questionable woman that way. But he had to stay calm. He had to
think. Ever since Sakura's dubious title, Ino had withdrawn, more
and more into herself. She talked less, and she spent more time
alone. Shikamaru was worried.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Being
heavily pregnant didn't sit well with Naruto. Not at all. His hips
hurt constantly, and he wondered if maybe this was why women had
those huge hips. His back was straining to keep him up straight
under the strange forward-pulling weight of the baby. And he couldn't
begin to describe the nausea.</p><P>The
first dinner he had shared with the seventails had had him puking for
nearly two hours afterward. He couldn't keep anything down, and it
was pissing him off! It didn't help that the damn snake-bastard
(heh, heh...Yeah, you can see what's coming, can't you! -Otaku) kept
swallowing his food whole!</p><P>Inadvertantly,
it seemed he was meant to run into Sesayoi today. Just as he was
going out for a walk, since his baby seemed to be sleeping at the
moment, he almost walked right into the snake-lord. Tohru was right
beside him, and helped to steady him, but the blue-haired boy seemed
rather preoccupied by something.</p><P>Perhaps
that was why he didn't see the attack coming.</p><P>Before
Naruto could even smile at the lord, to perhaps bely the fact that he
hated the man, Naruto felt an intense, utterly horrible pain. His
head jerked down, as his hands came forward, to protect the most
precious part of him, his child, but it was too late.</p><P>Sesayoi,
still wearing that damnable smile, had punched him, full strenth,
right in the stomach. He could feel a crushing pain, and an
overwhelming fear. He fell backwards, and Tohru was fighting Sesayoi
now, and losing.</p><P>Naruto
cried out, as contractions start to hit. He felt his hakama grow wet,
and all he could think was, 'NO!! Too soon!'</p><P>Kyuubi
felt the boy's pain, as if it were his own, and even as he cut that
pain out of his mind, appeared next to the boy. A quick glance told
him everything that was going on, and he growled. There was blood,
mixed with the amniotic fluid. Something was wrong with his baby.</p><P>Supporting
the blonde, who was trying to breath, like the females had taught
him, but he was in so much pain, Kyuubi sent a poisonous look at
Sesayoi, who was fending off Tohru easily, with that same slinky
smile.</p><P>"Sesayoi,
I will deal with you once I know my mate is alright. Until then,
GAURDS!" He bellowed. Five seventailed foxes appeared, and
bowed to their lord. "Take this snake to his chambers, and make
sure he doesn't escape."</p><P>When
that was taken care of, he carried his small mate as quickly as
possible to his room. Servants scurried this way and that, and Rinko
was sent to fetch the midwives. Sasuke came out of his room, just
waking, unsure what was going on. He saw Kyuubi, standing agitatedly
in one of the double doors leading to Naruto's room.</p><P>Something
had gone wrong.</p><P>"Kyuubi,
what happened?" Sasuke demanded. Giving the pretty boy a
condensed version of what he knew, Kyuubi kept his worried eyes on
his laboring mate. The blonde was pale, and writhing, he was in so
much pain. It beat at Kyuubi's mental barriers, and he was hard
pressed to keep it out.</p><P>Sasuke's
cold, dark eyes flared blood-red. He was pissed. How dare that snake
attack Naruto on their own soil?! And to use such an underhanded
tactic against Kyuubi! The dark-haired male stalked down the halls,
searching out this bastard.</p><P>When
Sasuke found the rooms in which Sesayoi was being held, he nodded to
the gaurds, who let him pass. The dark haired male entered the room,
regal, tall and utterly furious. He stared down the white snake, his
sharingan reflecting his attempts at mind control.</p><P>"You
hurt Naruto. Explain." Sasuke's order was clipped, and his
voice an arresting calm that reminded the snake king of his own.</p><P>"I'm
afraid, lord Sasuke, that I have no idea what you are talking about.
I merely set a test." The snake said, feigning innocence. 
Sesayoi knew there was nothing the fox could do. If Kyuubi attacked
Sesayoi, a war of unimaginable fury and destruction would ensue, and
the human world would suffer for it.</p><P>"Sesayoi,
you are a coward, and honorless. You attack the pregnant,
defenseless mate of a fellow lord. You are lower than low, lower than
the filthiest swamp creature. I will make sure you rue the day you
even thought of laying a hand on my mate, and you will writhe in
pain, before you die. This I swear on the blood of the Uchiha."
Sasuke's voice stayed even, and calm all through out his rant, and
his blood red eyes were trained on the albino lords every move. When
he finished, he turned, the sleeves of his kimono whirling, and he
stormed out.</p><P>Sesayoi,
for some strange reason, felt very afraid.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>The
springtime of youth was fast becoming a cold winter! Lee could feel
it all around him, in his fellow teammates, and in the younger teams
as well. His comrades were becoming stranger and stranger by the
day. Not only was the normally calm, collected Neji becoming
twitchy, Tenten was getting stressed and worried about the state of
the village.</p><P>It
wasn't a good situation.</p><P>That
day in practice, they had lost thirty seven shuriken, three kunai,
and a whindmill shuriken, to Neji's paranoid attacks on random
woodland creatures. When he was asked what was going on, he just
mumbled, glaring them down, with that slightly disconcerting lilac
gaze of his.</p><P>Lee,
however, was immune to that stare, for he found the strange lavender
color of his colleague's eyes soothing. He could stare at them all
day, but he was busy most of that time with training. He couldn't
help but notice other signs of Neji's distress, however. The boy
wasn't just flinching away from people he usually trusted, he was
paler than usual. His lustrous hair, which Lee never failed to
notice, was dull, and usually in a haphazard state of unbrushed-ness.</p><P>It
wasn't like Neji, and even Tenten noticed. She brought up that he
might be having problems at home, perhaps the main branch was giving
him trouble again, but that was dismissed, when Hinata began to show
the same strains.</p><P>Lee
was at a loss, and inexplicably, he wished he could just grin at the
feminine boy, and promise to take all his troubles away, sealing the
oath with the 'good-guy' pose.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>A
raw, painful cry was ripped from Naruto's throat, as another set of
crippling contractions began. The midwives were doing all they
could, but the child was stubborn as it's carrier, and on top of
that, said carrier wasn't nearly far enough along yet for them to
start the procedure. You see, for male pregnancies, there was no
where for the child to exit, so a Cesarian Section, or C-Section, was
required. But the child had to be in the lower half of the womb!
(Okay, I'm making this up by the seat of my pants, here, so bear with
me any medical types who read this...-Otaku)</p><P>A
sobbing grunt, as Naruto bore down again, on the babe inside him, who
seemed intent on causing him pain. He had been at this for eight
hours already, and it wasn't getting any easier. He swore that the
only thing that kept him from passing out was his ninja training. 
The only repreive he got was when the contractions stopped, and
blessed rest was allowed him. During the pain, he could only curse
the world for it's sick sense of humor and curse Kyuubi for putting
him through this.</p><P>The
red-head had stayed with him through the entire labor, and kept
encouraging him, and strangely enough, holdin his hand. Naruto was
always insanely grateful for this when the contractions started,
because then he had something to bear down on, something to
concentrate on other than the searing, ripping pain.</p><P>"Come
on, dear one, you can do this, just a little longer." Kyuubi
crooned to him, and sometimes the blonde wanted to just shove the
bastards tongue down his throat to shut him up. Again, a raw cry was
brough to his throat as his child moved, twisting in his womb. His
blue eyes filled with tears of pain, and the midwives scurried, worry
over taking them.</p><P>Another
four and a half hours of this passed, and the child still hadn't
moved any lower. Something was definately wrong, and they knew it. 
They didn't want to risk the surgery, but they had no choice. 
Naruto's strength was fading, and the pain was getting worse. He was
getting pale, which indicated a possible internal hemmorage (in other
words, Naruto was bleeding on the inside. -Otaku) and complications
with the babe.</p><P>The
head midwife, a silvering fox-woman who had seen several birthings,
aproached the two mates of the pregnant male.</p><P>"My
lords, he is fading fast, and I'm afraid we may lose them both if we
don't start the procedure now. The child is being stubborn, and
refuses to move lower. We may...We may end up losing the child if we
procede with the C-Section, but it's worth the risk in my opinion."</p><P>Naruto
gave another great heave and a strangled scream, as Sasuke and Kyuubi
shared a look. Turning as one, they nodded, Kyuubi stating, "Start
the procedure." They would not lose Naruto, no matter if the
child died.</p><P>They
were then ushered out of the birthing room, and the midwives began. 
Another hour later, they had gotten to the child, and finally saw the
problem. It was being strangled by it's own umbilical cord! It was
as if the child wished death, before it even began!</p><P>Pulling
the child from the womb, the head midwife unwrapped the cord, but the
babe, a boy, was already blue, and had no breath in it. She glanced
at Naruto who, exhausted, and still bleeding, was desperately trying
to see over the white cloth barrier they had erected to keep him from
seeing his own innards.</p><P>"What's
wrong?! Why isn't it crying?!" He questioned, his voice high
with worry.</p><P>They
shared a glance, each wondering if they should tell him. He forced
himself upright, fear and worry giving him a burst of strength, and
he gasped, when he saw the blue of his baby's skin. Tears again came
to those beautiful eyes, as he stared in horror.</p><P>"No...No!
NO!!!" He cried, reaching for the boy, the child that had been
forced on him, but still had all his love, and all his care. He felt
his heart break with every moment that little chest refused to rise,
to take in the life-giving air.</p><P>Kyuubi
and Sasuke immediately knew something was wrong, when they heard the
crash, the yell, as Naruto ripped his way from the birthing bed, and
to his child. They thrust open the doors onto the most saddening
scene in the history of his life. Naruto was limp, on the floor,
holding a silent, still child to his chest, weeping, begging the
little body to take a breath, screaming at the child.</p><P>"You
can't die! Don't! Don't leave me alone! Please, oh god, just breathe!
PLEASE!!!" Naruto's voice broke, a sob tearing through his
words, as he cradled the baby, his son, to him.</p><P>Kyuubi
shot forward, closely followed by his dark-haired fellow. Strong
arms encircled the weeping blonde, and a strangled, horrible wail
rose and filled the night air. The blue-eyed boy held the child to
his heart, praying to all the gods, all the saints, all the spirits
he could that his child would somehow come back to life, that it
would take a breath.</p><P>Sasuke
could only imagine how hard it was on the blonde, having carried, and
loved the child, only to have it die before he could even hold it. 
He pressed a hand into the small back, feeling the skin below his
fingers, slimey and warm, feeling for some bit of soul, some
lingering spirit, hoping.</p><P>Then,
he felt it. A small, tiny heart beat. It was faint, and irregular,
but there. The child was ALIVE! The son Naruto had bore was alive!
But something was keeping him from breathing!</p><P>Sasuke
immediately pulled the child from Naruto's arms, causing the blonde
to wail again, in distress, and fix Sasuke with a look that was half
hatred, half hurt. But Sasuke ignored this, sure that there was some
way to make the child breathe.</p><P>Thinking
lightning quick, barely hearing Kyuubi's rebuke, he stroked along the
child's throat, feeling for an obstruction, and finally, finding one!
It seemed some phlegm, left over from the amniotic fluid, was lodged
in the infants asophagus. Lack of air had left the child unconcious,
and therefore unable to even cry, or try to remove the lump.</p><P>With
a sharp burst of chakra, Sasuke dislodged the blockage, and, turning
the child over, delivered a sharp smack on the child's rear, to
awaken it. It worked like a charm, and the infant awoke, with a
healthy scream, and a large glob of phlegm falling with a splat onto
the stone floor. The baby boy's wails filled the room, as Sasuke,
with a proud, warm smile, delivered the child back to it's "mother".</p><P>Naruto's
eyes were filled with utter wonder, thankfullness, and complete,
unreserved love, as it moved over the child, his child. The boy's
wailing subsided as Naruto crooned to him, his beautiful blue eyes
opening, to watch it's mother's face.</p><P>The
child was small, and utterly perfect. Ten fingers, ten toes, and a
small, slimey tail. He had strange fox-ears on his head as well,
which were swivveling around to catch every sound. His tiny, upturned
nose was twitching, filling with smells, especially the soothing
scent that was his mother. He cooed, along with his mother's voice,
young as he was. His small, beautiful face was unmarred, missing the
whisker marks that were so distinct on his mother's face. However,
his blue eyes, so like his mothers, were also marked with some of his
father's blood as well, for their pupils, not circular like a humans,
were slitted, like a cat's, or perhaps, like a fox's.</p><P>"He's
perfect..." Kyuubi smiled, staring down at his little kit. 
"What should we name him, Naruto? Sasuke?"</p><P>"Yoh."
Naruto said, without hesitation. The name had come to him, the
minute those eyes had opened. "Yoh Uzumaki, Prince of the
Kitsune."</p><P>Sasuke
nodded his head in approval, commenting, "'Leaf', eh? A good
name. Perhaps it will tame some of the wild nature of his blood."
He said, grinning.</p><P>Naruto's
fatigue caught up with him, and his eyes, though bright with love and
pride for his new son, drooped, unable to stay open. The bundle in
his arms yawned as well, before closing it's own eyes, and going to
sleep.</p><P>"Kyuu?"
Naruto pleaded, holding out the child for the nine-tailed demon to
take. Kyuubi took Yoh, with a warm smile, and nodded to Naruto. 
Sasuke then picked up the blonde, who sagged against him, and carried
him to Sasuke's own chambers, since Naruto's had blood and birthing
fluid all over it.</p><P>Laying
the jinchuriiki in the bed, Sasuke tucked him in, a sweet, soft smile
on his face. Naruto clutched onto his sleeve, as he tried to leave,
pulling the raven-tressed male towards him. A smile, tired, but so
very happy that it melted Sasuke's heart was on his face, and the
blonde spoke, softly, but with every meaning possible.</p><P>"Thank
you, Sasuke. I would have lost him if not for you." Naruto
whispered, before pulling the would-be Avenger into a soft, chaste
kiss. Half-way through the kiss, however, he fell into a deep,
undisturbable sleep.</p><P>The
midnight-eyed male frowned, and sighed, before finishing the kiss,
and exiting the room.</p><P>He
found Kyuubi sitting in his office, Yoh held securely in his arms,
sleeping still, just like his mother. The look of utter love on
Kyuubi's face surprised Sasuke for but a moment, before the raven
knocked, startling the new father out of his reverie.</p><P>"Sasuke,
come see our son." He said, his voice holding such pride, such
unabashed care, that Sasuke found himself resenting it just a little.</p><P>"No,
Kyuubi, you are wrong. That is not my child. He is yours and
Naruto's." Sasuke's voice held bitter rage at himself, for
feeling this jealousy, this hatred of the two, for now, they had what
he lacked. They had family, where he had none. Kyuubi looked shocked
and utterly confused for a moment, before his eyes turned
contemplative.</p><P>"So,
you will refuse this child? You will refuse Yoh your love, your
care?" Kyuubi's voice held a bit of dissapointment, and Sasuke
was unsure if it was dissapointment in him, or that the child would
not receive his love. "This child is as much yours as mine. 
Remember, Sasuke, had it not been for my chakra altering the child's
genetics, he would be some unnamed bastards child, rather than my
own. You saved his life, gave him life just as surely as Naruto or I
did. He is your son as well as ours."</p><P>The
raven felt there was something strange about that logic, but was
unsure what it was. He did love the child, for it was Naruto's and he
loved Naruto. But...the child would never have a Sharingan. It
wouldn't have the black hair nor eyes of his clan. It would never
wear the fan that was the symbol of his clan. Could he act as though
it were his own?</p><P>"I
do understand that it is hard, Sasuke, for you want someone to
continue the legacy of your sharingan. But, for now, be happy with
this child. After all, I'll be bearing the next one. And that one
<I>will</I>
be yours." Kyuubi's fox grin stripped across his face, and the
lewdness in his eyes gave Sasuke no doubts about how Kyuubi wished
for <I>that</I>
child to be created. A blush crept across his face, and he turned
his head away, feigning indifference.</p><P>Kyuubi
laughed then, for he knew that the Uchiha would bear the weight of
this child with Naruto and himself, and for that, he was happy. And
who knew? The making of the next child might be all the fun that the
making of this one hadn't been!</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Subaku
no Gaara crushed the assassin with a simple closing of his fist,
finishing the last one in the group of four. They had nearly reached
his sand armor this time. He was getting out of shape. Perhaps his
father was getting rather...tired? of their game now. After all, it
had been nearly five years since these assassination attempts had
started. Even Gaara was getting bored with them.</p><P><I><B>Then
let me annihilate this town, brat! You know you hate it just as much
as I do...</B></I></p><P>The
beast inside of him, Shukaku the tanuki, the Ichibi, growled from
within him, bloodlust and hatred filling him. He hated his container
and loved him at the same time. After all, though he was a cage, he
was also a beautiful weapon. A shinobi was, after all, only a
weapon. And the combination of Gaara and Shukaku was the perfect
weapon.</p><P>No
one escaped them, and no one ever would. They were undefeated, and
Gaara had never once suffered an injury. Shukaku felt it was a waste
to marr his vessels perfect flesh. He was almost glad he had left
his foolish kind to fend for themselves. This pretty creature who
housed him was more than enough for him.</p><P>'Not
yet, Shukaku-sama. Mother still loves this place, and I would not go
against her.'</p><P>Shukaku
rolled his eyes. Sadly, the same beautiful insanity that drew
Shukaku to him, made him rather intangible as well. He still
beleived that his mother controlled the sand that protected him. 
That, though endearing, was foolish. But the one-tail had as of yet
failed to break his beautiful jinchuriiki of that habit.</p><P>Soaking
up the blood of the idiotic assassins, Gaara's sand then returned to
the gourd on his back, and the insomniac sat on the roof, staring at
the bright moon. There was nothing left of the shinobi, not even
bones, and the seafoam-eyed male liked it that way. His mother's
bloodlust was appeased for the moment, and Shukaku went back to
crooning his love to the red-head.</p><P>Falling
back into the desert of his mind, he settled into the arms of the
tanuki-badger. In his human form, Shukaku was exquisitely handsome,
and utterly ravishing. His short, spikey, sandy-blonde hair,
(basically Gaara's only sandyblonde, and a little, teensy bit longer
-Otaku) contrasted perfectly with his golden-bronzed skin. His eyes,
black where the white should be, and golden, had crosses for pupils,
and looked utterly taken with the pale teenager in his arms. He wore
simple hakama and a vest, rather than the traditional kimon, leaving
his firm chest to the warm, desert air. He grinned at the little
male in his arms.</p><P>"Now,
now, little brat, are you nervous?" He teased.</p><P>Gaara's
black rimmed eyes glared at his friend/mate, "Never."</p><P>"Not
even a little? There will be lots of little gennin at Konoha. They
might all gang up on you, and take us down." Shukaku joked,
laughing deep and rumbling. Gaara buried his face into the firm skin
of Shukaku's chest, pouting. Only inside his mind could he act like
this. To show this side of himself to the outside world was suicide.</p><P>"Come
now, Gaara. We'll be fine. We have months to go before we even
leave, and you won't even have to speak much. Your brother and
sister talk enough for all of us." The ichibi said, lifting the
boy's chin, so as to see those pretty eyes. Placing a tender, soft
kiss on his pouting lips, he grinned.</p><P>The
boy felt reassured, and, had he not been who he was, might have fell
asleep in the demon's arms. But that would bring about disaster for
this town his mother still loved. Shukaku violently hated the
Village hidden in the Sand, for all the atrocities they had commited
to Gaara over the years. He would someday destroy the town, he swore
it.</p><P>Gaara
couldn't wait for that day.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Haku
positively adored the little hanyou. He was adorable, especially
when Zabuza held him! The big man was absolutely terrified of the
little creature, or perhaps more accurately, terrified that he might
drop it. Yoh had grown, in the last two months, to become a bouncing
baby boy.</p><P>Sitting
now, in the garden, Haku held him, Zabuza right behind him, looking
down at his feminine kunai, holding the child. Naruto smiled at them
from a bench right across from them. He was feeling much better
since his pregnancy and had recently began training again. The
blonde was ecstatic, utterly happy. Not only was he nearly back in
shape again, he had a beautiful, sweet bundle of joy.</p><P>One
thing that everyone had noted about yoh was that he didn't cry very
much at all. He was a sweet child, calm and quiet. Naruto, for the
longest time though that perhaps he had been hurt by the lack of
oxygen, but there didn't seem anything wrong with the child, just
that he had a quiet personality.</p><P>Tsubasa
was positively taken with the child. He took every chance he could
to steal the baby away from whoever was holding it, and coo to him. 
He took his job of protecting the boy seriously, and every time he
came into view of Yoh, the boy stopped whatever he was doing and
would cry furiously, until Tsubasa came and held him. It was as if,
somehow, Yoh knew Tsubasa was to protect him.</p><P>Naruto
thought it was positively sweet.</p><P>Kyuubi,
however, hated the idea that his child liked some orphaned two-tail
more than his own father! Sasuke laughed, whenever Kyuubi became
jealous of the little orphan. It wasn't as if they could choose who
Yoh clinged to.</p><P>But,
for once, it seemed Yoh was content with being held by Haku, even
though Tsubasa was right next to him. Tohru, appearing on the scene,
one of his small winged faeries sitting demurely on his shoulder,
tapped Naruto on the shoulder. The young shinobi turned to him, and
caught the look of confusion and apprehension on his face.</p><P>"Naruto,
it seems that...Well, the Sandaime is dead. And, the Rokudaime,
Tsunade, has decided to hold the Chounin exams this year, in one
months time."</p><P>Naruto's
great blue eyes widened, and then became very sad. The old man had
been kind to him, if utterly dense as to his peoples' idiocy. He
would miss the geezer, and wished he could have gone to the funeral
at the very least. But now, this new Hokage, might just be an
opportunity...</p><P>Handing
Yoh to Tsubasa, Naruto nodded to the boy. He began to follow the
blonde prince, as Naruto briskly walked through the winding halls,
towards Kyuubi's office. Haku, Zabuza, and Tohru followed behind,
anxious to see what was going on in the little blonde's head.</p><P>Bursting
into the office, and startling Kurina, who was in the middle of a
report to Kyuubi, Naruto strode up to his husband's desk, and slammed
his hands down.</p><P>"We're
going to Konoha!" He declared. Kyuubi looked up in surprise,
and then narrowed his eyes.</p><P>"Naruto...That's
not the best idea."</p><P>"Yes,
it is, Kyuubi! Now is the perfect time! They have a new Hokage, which
is our chance to charm the fuck out of her, and win an ally in the
human world for Kitsunegakure!" Naruto argued, his point firm.</p><P>"Maybe
so, but that new Hokage is also a chance for them to declare war on
Kitsunegakure. Though we'd beat the pants off them, I'd really rather
not have to!" Kyuubi declared, with equal fervor. The
spectators watched, as the match pinged back and forth between the
two.</p><P>"Kyuubi,
it's time to go home. Yoh is old enough we can travel with him now,
and I want him to see where his mother was born!" Naruto said,
his bright eyes filling with fake tears. Kyuubi knew they were fake,
but couldn't help cavign just a bit at the sight. He truly did love
Naruto.</p><P>"Fine.
But we will go with our full entourage, and we will go in official
capacity." Kyuubi's tone made it final, and Naruto nodded,
agreeing.</p><P>"But,
I want Sasuke, Tohru and I to take the chounin exams! As a show of
goodfaith, and cooperation with our new allies!" Naruto chirped.
 Kyuubi frowned, unsure.</p><P>Kurina
piped up, "It'd be a good chance for you to meet the other
Kage's that might show, Kyuubi-sama."</p><P>Kyuubi
sighed, giving in to this as well. "Fine, fine. Prepare
everything. Kurina, you're in charge while I'm gone. Have fun..."
 He grinned, stretching from behind his huge pile of paperwork.</p><P>"That's
fine, milord, but you still have to finish that paperwork before
lunch." She said, a haughty smile on her face. Kyuubi moaned,
and the group laughed at his misery.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Tohru
was more worried than he let on, though.</p><P>Shino's
letter had been filled with worry, and anxiety. His friends were
changing around him, and something bad was happening in Konoha. He
could feel it.</p><P>What
worried Tohru the most however, was that small animals seemed to be
dying off there, of what looked like animal attacks, Shino said. It
was strange.</p><P>Tohru
couldn't help but feel like they would be walking into enemy
territory...</p><P>End
Chapter </p><P>Otaku:
Okay, now that that's over with, an announcement:</p><P>I'm
having a vote! The vote is on whether or not to include Lemons in
this story. If you've read Run Away, one of my other fics, you'll
know I'm really good at them. Depending on the tally of votes, this
story might include several lemons, including a threesome between
Naruto, Sasuke, and Kyuubi, as well as a lemon between Shukaku and
Gaara. Also, I might throw in one between the demons. I might even,
if given enough motivation, throw in a hetero lemon! So, now's the
time to place your vote! I will only accept votes between now and
the posting of the next chapter. Until then, feel free to give me
your opinion!</p><P>Kyuubi:
I vote yes!!!</p><P>Otaku:
Of course YOU do... Horny bastard.</p><P>Kyuubi:
Hey...</p><P>See
ya'll!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 14</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
Wow...I was utterly astonished at the response to my pole. As the
author I congratulate all of you, and thank you all for your
responses.</p><P>And
so, without further ado: We will soon have lemons added to this
story. Congratulations! (I've been wanting to do a more in depth
version of the rape scene, but I might not...I'm not sure yet...)</p><P>Also,
I just realised a greivous mistake I made in the thirteenth chapter.
For the Chapter number/name thingy, I put Run Away instead of Kits!.
I apologise profusely, but, as a testament to the fact that Authors
are human as well, it will stay the way it is. Thank you for your
patience.</p><P>Anyway,
here's the fourteenth chapter, and the next installment in the Kits!
Saga!</p><P>Kits!</p><P>Pairings:
Okay, I officially have a full list of pairings! I decided them last
chapter...but didn't post all of them. Here they are!</p><P>NaruSasuKyuuGaaShuka</p><P>ShikaChou</p><P>Shino(OC)Tohru</p><P>IruKaka</p><P>ZabuHaku</p><P>LeeNeji</p><P>HinaKiba</p><P>KankuSaku</p><P>TemariTenten
(cause neither of them get enough love!)</p><P>KurenaiAnko
(since Kurenai needs a masculine partner, and Asuma died.)</p><P>If
I forgot any, feel free to add them, I check all reviews, but don't
get pissed if your pairing doesn't appear in this story. After all,
there's a lot of plot, even though most of it revolves around love...</p><P>Warnings:
Dear god...Um...Predjudice, needless Homicide, and misuse of
Hitsuzen/Fate/Serendipity. How's that for some warnings?!</p><P>Description:
 Kitsunegakure's procession draws a lot of attention, and
unfortunately, they aren't met with the best reception. However,
what's worse is, Tsumi has gone utterly nuts! Oops, there goes a
procter...What will the Sand's reaction be to these new arrivals?!</p><P>Disclaimer:
 If I owned Naruto, the plot would've been SO much more convoluted.</p><P>Kits!
Chap. 14</p><P>The
procession was...Large, to say the least. As they passed, humans
watched, as if some infernal parade was strolling down their street.
And to them, it probably looked a lot like it. Foxes walking on
their back legs, wearing kimonos, travelling with carriages, and
strange half-human half-fox creatures. Not to mention the shinobi
that accompanied them, and the strange human pair that walked side by
side the leader, a tall, broad fox-man with nine full tails, fluffed
out behind him.</p><P>So,
it wasn't any surprise that Konoha knew they were coming long before
they got there. Tohru was actually utterly astonished that they were
met with only fifty Anbu and a few jounin, plus their precious
Hokage. They were stopped at the gates, like some demonic parade on
a wall-scroll.</p><P>Kyuubi,
however, was more surprised by the size of that woman's
breasts...God, those had to be...D's? DD's? Maybe even DDD's! He
was drooling by the time she stood in front of them, all threat and
pomp. Naruto smacked him upside the head, simply for being a
letcher, which reminded him that he was there for a reason.</p><P>"Lady
Tsunade, the fifth Hokage of Konoha, correct?" He intoned, his
voice barely containing the hatred he felt for this place. She
nodded, her own hatred for this man apperant on her face.</p><P>"What
is the Nine-tailed Fox doing back here. You were sealed, and your
Jinchuriiki outlawed after he became a missing-nin." She
restrained herself. Had she not, she'd be growling like some animal
right now. Tsunade didn't trust this fascimile of the fox, nor did
she accept that the blonde beside him was the jinchuriiki. Couldn't
be.</p><P>"Rumours
of my demise have been greatly exaggerated." The fox scoffed. (I
so stole this, I just don't know where from, otherwise they'd get
credit for it. -Otaku)</p><P>"What
do you want here, you demon?!" Tsunade screeched, refusing to
accept this creatures civility. "Come to finish the job?!"</p><P>Kyuubi's
joking tone turned sour, and his face took on an anger that was
rarely matched. The only thing that kept him from roaring at this
woman was Sasuke's soft hand on his sleeve.</p><P>"I
can't say that I do not hold a grudge against this village, for you
have done some horrible things to Naruto, but I did not attack this
village of my own accord, woman." Kyuubi's voice was acidic,
and quite a number of the Anbu flinched.</p><P>"We've
done nothing to that traitor. And if you did not attack us of your
own accord, then who forced you? And why did you not seek our aid to
end the bespellment?" She hissed.</p><P>"DID
NOTHING?!" Kyuubi's temper broke at this point. He couldn't
stand the thought of those asses getting away with hurting his
Naru-chan. "DID NOTHING is RIGHT! You did NOTHING to protect an
innocent child from the wrath of your civilians. The ANBU that were
assigned to gaurd him pointed him out to the worst of them, and then!
THEN! You're ninja had the nerve to-"</p><P>"STOP!"
Naruto cried. Turning fearful eyes to Kyuubi, Naruto backed away from
him, "Don't! You can't!"</p><P>Kyuubi
stopped, turning to look at the frightened blonde, slowly realising
that as his rant had gone on, not only had he gotten closer to
transforming into his full-animal form, as well as closer to
revealing the truth about Naruto's rape. He sighed, as a wail issued
from the bundle in Naruto's arms. His rage had awoken Yoh, as well. 
Turning away from where his mate was trying to soothe their child, he
looked the Hokage in the eyes again, finding quite a bit of surprise
there.</p><P>"I
gave you warning. I said, 'Find the reason for our departure in the
foundation of your village. We will return for the Chuunin exams.' 
We have returned, and you have still not figured out why we left in
the first place. The only survivor of the Uchiha massacre chose to
come with us, rather than stay in the village of his birth, and you
still do not understand why. A gennin, one of your trainees, chose
to come with us, and STILL you know not why."</p><P>"This
happened while the third hokage was still in command, and I was not
informed of it. I apologise." Tsunade lied, and Kyuubi could
smell the lie on her, but didn't call her bluff. "But that does
not explain why you attacked us the first time. If you were
ensorcelled, why did you not seek out our help?"</p><P>Kyuubi's
eyes turned whistful, as he remembered. "It's rather simple. I
didn't have the willpower to. By my very nature, it's what I wanted.
Just not the people I wanted to kill."</p><P>"What
could you possibly be talking about?!" Tsunade snapped. A cool
breeze flowed through the trees surrounding the village, and ruffled
the long, flame-colored hair of the demon, and his eyes took a sad
cast.</p><P>"They'd
killed my mate. For no apperant reason, they killed her, spreading
the blood in a large circle, knowing I'd smell it. The smell drove
me crazy, drove every bit of self-preservation and intelligence out
of my mind. I was a wild animal, for I knew, though they didn't. She
was pregnant. They'd killed my kits, and taunted me with the
blood..." His voice faded, and his blood-red eyes turned to the
sky, then back to the pretty, smiling boy in his mate's arms, 
knowing that he no longer needed to dwell on it.</p><P>"Who?
Who did it?" the blonde woman couldn't not ask. She had to
know, it was like watching a tragic play. She had to know the ending.</p><P>"Who
else? The Uchiha's. Luckily, they birthed some intelligent
offspring, like Itachi and Sasuke, otherwise I'd have forced Naruto's
hand, and murdered all those morons. I'm glad, though, that one of
the last Uchiha's is now my mate. It's suiting." He said,
turning to Sasuke.</p><P>The
dark eyes were wide, with disbeleif, and utter horror. Sasuke was
about to burst, to ask so many questions, but something in the
demonic eyes before him told him now was not the time. His face shut
down, his calm mask back in place, and Sasuke calmed himself
forcibly. Though Naruto noticed that his grip on his book was so
tight his hand was shaking.</p><P>"You
expect me to beleive that the Uchiha clan, one of the most respected,
valued clans in my village, killed the mate of the nine tailed fox,
and then, spread her blood all around Konoha? Why? For what
purpose?" Tsunade deadpanned, her tone and face clearly
expressing that she didn't beleive it for one moment. But Kyuubi's
face was dead serious. He meant it.</p><P>"Were
the records your Uchiha kept intact? Were there any indescrepensies? 
Such as a large body of people gone for a large amount of time, for
no apperant reason? Or were you all too busy mourning to notice
this?" The red-headed man scoffed, obviously disliking this
woman with great intensity.</p><P>Tsunade
dislike the fox, just as equally, but her attention was rather
brought to the blonde who was cooing to a small, wriggling bundle. 
Zabuza of the Seven Mist Swordsmen was standing behind the boy, and a
small, feminine boy, with long dark hair was smiling at the bundle as
well. Tohru, the other missing nin was standing near to the blonde
as well, as if they all were protecting him.</p><P>"Why
do you come bearing a child? Surely, you should have left him home,
if you came here, where you expected such hatred?" She
reprimanded. However, she was taken aback, when those blue eyes, so
soft on the child, turned up to her, feirce and determined.</p><P>"This
child is mine, and he will not be seperated from me. I brought him
here, because he deserves to see the town he should have been born
and raised in. He deserves to be shown where his mother was born."
 Naruto's voice carried, and all the ANBU were shocked, clearly
wondering what woman would have lain with the fox-carrier.</p><P>"His
mother lives in this village? Where is she?" Tsunade asked,
curious, since there were very few women in the train, and none who
were shown such honor as the blonde.</p><P>"I
am his mother." Naruto said, standing tall, and cradling the
squirming boy-child, who was now fussing, and reaching for a little,
red-headed fox-child.</p><P>Said
red-headed fox-child held out his arms, "Perhaps I should take
Yoh-dono, Naruto-sama?" Naruto smiled at Tsubasa, and handed
the child to him, a soft, sweet smile on his face, before he turned
back to the blonde woman before him.</p><P>"I
carried that child in my belly, for nine-months, and I gave birth to
him. His father is the great nine-tailed fox demon, Kyuubi, and his
other father is Uchiha Sasuke, who gave him life, when he was dead."
 Naruto spoke, proud and utterly unashamed of the impossibility of
his words, "He is Yoh Uzumaki, Prince of the Kitsune."</p><P>The
reddening sky, and soft, cooling sky, heralded the sunset, even as
Tsunade stared at this boy, who seemed intent on telling lies. 
Sighing, for her curiousity was peaked, whether she wanted it to or
not, she made up her mind. After all, if the Kyuubi had come to
destroy them, it wouldn't have knocked so politely.</p><P>"You
will follow me. Your entourage will be closely gaurded by ANBU black
ops, and you will stay in my personal home. Do you understand?"</p><P>Naruto
gave a whoop, which startled Tsunade, and reminded her...of her
little brother. It was painful, and she'd really rather not deal with
that. She involuntarily grabbed for the jade necklace around her
neck.</p><P>"Thanks,
Obaa-chan!" Naruto yelled, grinning a mile a minute. Yoh
giggled in Tsubasa's arms, and Tsubasa gave a slow, small smile, much
like Sasuke was. Kyuubi however, frowned, unsure he liked these
arrangements. Oh well, if they were a trap, he'd just destroy the
town again, and run away with Naruto, Sasuke, Yoh and Tsubasa. 
Zabuza, Haku and Tohru could handle themselves.</p><P>And
so, the nine-tailed fox was admitted into Konoha, strangely enough.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>It
had been days since that blonde whore had entered the city with her
precious son, her kit, and Tsumi was furious. She'd been furious,
and on edge since that damn bitch had entered the city. But, she'd
had to reign in her temper, mostly, since, now that she knew
that...Dammit, she was running out of names to call him, since he'd
entered the city, she'd found a new way she can hurt him.</p><P>He
had a kit...A beautiful, blue eyed kit, just like himself, and
now...there was a perfect way to hurt him. All she had to do was go
after the kit! But it wouldn't be easy. She was still angry, and it
didn't help that now that their quarantine was over, they were
allowed to roam the city freely, with escort of course.</p><P>There
was an easy way to assuage her anger, however. And, in the dark of
the night, it was perfect to find a victim.</p><P>The
man fell for her charms easily. He had a terrible cough, but he was
one hell of a lay. And on top of that, he bled perfectly. Slitting
his throat after he had exerted himself so thouroghly was almost too
easy, but she still felt the wonderful satisfaction of his blood
between her breasts.</p><P>Even
better, his innards gave her a wonderful reading. Following the
ancient teachings of the brown fox tribe, she pulled out his
intestines, and heart and other guts, searching through them, and
finding good answers.</p><P>Her
quarry, the snake, was near. He was already setting his own plans
into action, and all she had to do was be of use to him, and he'd
help her gain whatever she wished. After the reading, she ate the
heart, saving the liver, and lungs for her little friend.</p><P>After
all, those birds and squirrels surely couldn't be filling up his
need?</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Tsunade
was pissed. Not only had another of her Jounin died in a horrible,
beastly way, she still had no clue how! Not only that, that damnable
blonde was hanging around her office, AGAIN!!!</p><P>How
was she supposed to fend off Shizune's attempts to get her to work,
with this annoying, terribly loud blonde around all the time! It was
driving her mad! And, she had that horrifyingly calm Haku asking her
about tips on his HAIR for god's sake!</p><P>Finally,
she just gave them the okay, figuring they could be under watch, just
as long as they were well the fuck away from her. She'd had the
first peaceful drink of the day, and went on with her business.</p><P>That
is, until Shizune reminded her. The Sand team was coming today. 
Including that ever creepifying Gaara of the Sand kid. God dammit,
her problems just got worse and worse, didn't they?</p><P>"Alright,
Shizune. Kakashi will guide the Kitsunegakure group, and Iruka will
guide the Sand village group, mkay? That'll keep those two away from
each other too, and everyone will be happy. Alright? Now go away, and
let me drink in peace." She groaned.</p><P>Shizune
sighed, and Tonton oinked.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P><B>I
don't like this village either.</B></p><P>Gaara,
if he had not been Gaara, would have sighed. Shukaku had been
chatting away at him the entire three day journey, and Gaara just
wanted to lay down, and fall into one of those sleep-depped trances. 
He loved those, cause they were as close to sleep as he got.</p><P>Temari
much agreed with Gaara's mental thought, though she didn't know he
was thinking it. All she wanted was sleep, a bath, and maybe a cute
girl to oggle. Men were so troublesome, especially when she was
around them all the time. (-Giggle-snort- You knew I'd do it! You
knew it! -Otaku)</p><P>Kankurou
was having EXACTLY the same thoughts as his big sister, except for
the part about the bath.</p><P>Baki
was the same, minus the women. (One, he's the teacher guy with half
his face covered, and two, he's asexual. In my opinion. Plus, it's
easier on me. -Otaku)</p><P>And
they were all set to, except, they had to deal with this stupid
Chuunin guide. Couldn't the Hokage have atleast sent a Jounin? Jesus
Christ. Temari didn't know who that was, but his name sounded like a
decent summation of this situation.</p><P>"Hi!
I'm Umino Iruka, and I'll be your guide while you stay here." 
The man was small, and he had a scar running across the bridge of his
nose. His dark hair was pulled into a spikey ponytail behind his
head. He had a kind, but embarrassed smile on his face.</p><P>Gaara,
blinking, spoke his first words of the day.</p><P>"Where's
your seme?"</p><P>Everyone
stared for a few moments. First off, Gaara knew what the fuck a SEME
was?! Second, he'd ASKED a QUESTION! What the hell?</p><P>Iruka's
face went blood red, and he had to blink back tears. He really
hadn't wanted to be reminded of Kakashi anyway. And what was with
this kid!</p><P>"First
off, it's none of your business, and second off, how the hell did you
know that?!" Iruka yelled. He was in Demon-Teacher mode, and
even Shukaku was blinking in surprise.</p><P>It
was the Ichibi who had prompted the question. Gaara, due to his
enhanced senses, had smelled the beta-ness of Iruka's scent, and so,
immediately asked Shukaku. Shukaku simply told him to ask. So, Gaara
had.</p><P>Now,
Gaara had been yelled at for the first time in his life. And...He
didn't like it. The sand creeped forward along the floor, towards
the brunette teacher. Temari and Kankurou were sure they'd have to
deal with another dead body, until...</p><P>Iruka
hugged Gaara.</p><P>Now
Gaara was screaming in his head, a little chibi version of himself
running around going, WTF?! WTF?!</p><P>"Now,
that was a wonderful question. I'm not sure why you thought of it,
but I could tell, you don't get praised much, do you?" Iruka's
soft, dark blue eyes were staring at Gaara with an emotion he'd
always attached to his uncle, Yashamaru. It was...Kindness.</p><P>Iruka
had seen that exact look on Naruto's face, the day Iruka had picked
the blonde up and taken him home to a nice meal and a good bath. He
missed the talks, the...companionship. Without Naruto, and without
Kakashi, Iruka was so alone, just like this boy.</p><P>Gaara
found himself quite unable to command the sand to kill this impudent
man. Shukaku was purring, finding himself reminded of the few days
he had had with his mother, a calm, happy beta, much like this man.</p><P>"Um...You
should probably let Gaara go now. I'm surprised you're not dead."
 Kankuro announced.</p><P>Iruka
did let go of the boy, but kept a hand on his shoulder, causing Gaara
to look up at him with a strangely docile look. Smiling at Kankuro
and Temari, he said, very simply, "You all aren't used to
dealing with hurt children are you?"</p><P>Baki
frowned, unsure what this Leaf-nin was getting at.</p><P>"I
deal with these kinds of children, as a sort of hobby. Gaara just
needs...Well, for lack of a better term, he needs a family."</p><P>"We
are his family!" Temari growled. She was unsure what was going
on. This Chuunin had come in, and changed everything. Gaara was
acting like some kind of tamed housecat, and it was all this
brunette's doing.</p><P>"Well..."Iruka
sighed, furrowing his brow, unsure what he should do. "At any
rate, we should get to the hotel you all will be staying at. Then, we
can go to dinner, my treat, ok?"</p><P>Gaara
nodded, following him. The others had no choice but to follow as
well. It was no doubt the strangest day in all the sand-nin's lives.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Kakashi
was in a much worse boat. He was utterly exhausted from his large
strain of missions, not that he was complaining, or anything. He was
quite happy with his number of missions, thanks. He just didn't want
to deal with these guys.</p><P>It
was bad enough he'd nearly pee'd his pants on the bridge when faced
with the Kyuubi, now, to see it, standing in front of him in human
form, with a huge grin on it's face, was almost enough to make him
cry. Plus he hadnt been feeling the most stable since Iruka's
leaving. However, he had to admit, Naruto with a baby was cute.</p><P>"So,
since I didn't get to ask when we last met, how is Iruka-sensei?"
Naruto asked, his tone soft at the mention of the elder male. Kakashi
blanched, not wanting to broach the subject. Naruto knew about their
relationship, and would probably sic Kyuubi on him if he told him how
they broke up...</p><P>"Doing
good. You'll see him later, most likely." Kakashi said,
avoiding the subject deftly, if he did say so himself. And he did!</p><P>Suddenly,
though things went from bad to worst, when the InoShikaChou group
passed by. The strange garb of the visitors and the strange
appearances drew their eyes, and ignited a problem.</p><P>Normally
peaceful Chouji stalked over towards Naruto, intent on regaling the
fox-carrier with verbal abuse, and a warning to stay away from
Konoha. Shikamaru was following him closely, hoping to minimise
damage, only to stop dead in his tracks, same as Chouji.</p><P>The
Naruto that turned to look at them wasn't the same, loveable idiot
that had left. These sky-blue eyes had seen too much, knew too much,
and were filled with a strange, intangible sadness, that made them
even deeper. This Naruto was somehow older, wiser, and yet
infinitely younger and more innocent than any of them could
comprehend, and Ino gasped, strangely soothed by those eyes.</p><P>"Chouji,
Ino, Shikamaru, it's nice to see you again. I hope you're well."
 Naruto's once loud, boisterous voice was calm, quiet, filled with
gentle patience one usually heard from a mother. For some reason,
this painful patience ignited fear and hurt in Chouji, and he lashed
out.</p><P>"How
dare you! You leave, set that monster free, and then come back,
expecting everything to be okay?! What the hell is wrong with you,
Naruto!" Chouji shouted, causing quite a stir, a crowd to
gather. Kakashi moved to step forward, to stop this before it got
anywhere, but a flash of red beat him to it.</p><P>Kyuubi
was in front of Naruto now, between his blonde and the irate
Akamichi. He looked down upon the angry child, and suddenly, in
front of all his subordinates, and all the villagers gathered, knelt
before him.</p><P>"I
killed your mother, didn't I? I know you can never forgive me, and I
don't expect you to, but I hope that one day you can understand how
much those deaths cost me. I am sorry."</p><P>Chouji
was silent, utterly aghast. He had hated this creature, had hated
Naruto for a very long time, since he found out his secret. After
all, that beast had taken his mother, not just from him, but also
from his father. He had hated Kyuubi. Now, now the object of his
hate was apologising, and...that made him human, not just some
monster. Suddenly, Chouji couldn't hate him anymore.</p><P>Tears,
blue as the sky above, fell down the large boy's cheeks, and try as
he could to wipe them away, there was nothing he could do. 
Shikamaru, his best friend, came up, and put an arm around him,
letting him cry. But Chouji didn't want to cry! He didn't want to
forgive! Shoving Shikamaru aside, he ran off, tears still
unstoppable.</p><P>From
Tsubasa's arms, Yoh cried as well, loud and unignorable. Tsubasa,
instead of bothering anyone, handed him to the nursemaid, who set
about feeding him. Naruto turned to Shikamaru, giving him that huge
grin, a reminder of the past, but now...Now, the shadow-user could
see the sadness, the depression that lurked just behind that smile.</p><P>"Well,
maybe...Maybe I shouldn't have come here..." Naruto said, the
first words of doubt in himself anyone had heard, ever. Even Sasuke
turned, in shock, and looked at the blonde. This time, it was Ino
who took the innitiative.</p><P>"No,
Naruto. You...You brought us a chance. Things have...Things have
been going wrong in Konoha. I think...I think you're the one to fix
it." Her voice was low, as it was normally these days.</p><P>Ino
hated that she couldn't do anything for her teammates, but she'd been
watching them dance around each other for nigh over a year now. It
was time someone fixed things between them. It wasn't fair to either
of them, and it wasn't doing any good for their teamwork.</p><P>Naruto's
blue eyes widened. He looked, discreetly, around, trying to see if
that was what all of them expected of him, that he'd just fix
everything. Most of the eyes held the same fire, fear that the
rotund-boy's had. But there were a few...a few lingering glances
that seemed to be begging something.</p><P>Tohru
put a reassuring hand on Naruto's shoulder, knowing how much it was
for the preteen to take in. He surely wasn't used to this kind of
attention! (Or maybe he was...) The crowd started dispersing, and
Tohru felt a strange pull, as if some invisible string tugged on him,
when he saw the back of a white jacket, pulled up high over the back
of the owners neck, and several, small insects crawling along the
back of that jacket. A strange tangible thrill ran down his spine,
and he felt almost as if he was supposed to reach out, and grab that
jacket.</p><P>He
resisted this problematic urge. He had a Prince to protect, after
all.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Taking
the life of the Kazekage wasn't by any means a peice of cake, but it
was easier than the fall of Konoha, which took a lot more planning.
Orochimaru was very happy that his very well-organised containment
team set up the feild, before the battle began. That way, he didn't
have to worry about morons wandering in.</p><P>Luckily,
the Kazekage was much weaker than he had anticipated. Something about
the way he ran the village had put him out of shape. Orochimaru
taunted the man, as he died, about what he was going to do to his
town, once he was done with Konoha. Tears leaked from the ninja's
eyes.</p><P>Orochimaru
laughed at him. Couldn't even die with dignity, like a true shinobi!
Had to weep on his deathbed. It was very humorous.</p><P>"Kabuto.
You are going back to Konoha. Once there, get rid of that Shadow
Clone of yours, and take your 'rightful place'. It's time to set our
plan into action."</p><P>The
shadow behind him nodded once, and dissapeared. Orochimaru smiled, a
very wicked smile. His long tongue snuck out, wetting his lips. He
was already tasting the heart of that old wretch. He couldn't
wait...</p><P>End

Wow...Orochimaru is WAY out of the loop, huh?</p><P>Orochimaru:

ShikaChou.</p><P>Warnings: Veiled battles
of will between two villages, not-so-veiled attractions towards
strangers, and utter chaos. I hope you enjoy!</p><P>Description: Tsunade meets
Naruto, Gaara meets Sasuke, the Chuunin exams ensue, and small
fissures become wider.</p><P>Disclaimer: If I owned
Naruto, Naruto wouldn't just be male all the time. He'd switch back
and forth, on whim!</p><P>Kits! Chap. 15</p><P>Sasuke had skipped out on
the whole meeting the council thing. After all, they didn't exactly
need to be debreifed about anything, they weren't Konoha nin anymore.
Hell, they didn't even know the hokage anymore. He remembered the
broken-hearted look on Naruto's face, when they found out about the
death of the Sandaime. Sasuke had to admit, that one had hit him
kinda hard too. After the massacre by Itachi, the Sandaime was one of
the few to actually see how broken he was. He knew that the Sandaime
had taken care of everyone, had kept the spirit of the leaf-village
alive.</p><P>Now, wandering through the
village that had been his home not twelve months ago, he felt almost
as if...as if it had all changed. Or maybe, as if he had changed. He
went through the Uchiha district, and wasn't burdened by an
overwhelming sadness, or even regret. After retreiving a few very
important objects, he found himself saying a quiet prayer for the
souls of his ancestors, his family, and then moving on, a sword on
his back, another strapped to his hip, and a small bundle safely
tucked into his sleeve.</p><P>He knew what had changed.
He was the one who had changed. He had let go of vengeance. After
all, if there were two Uchiha males out there, that was double the
population later, right? And something about Itachi's reasoning
irked Sasuke now. He had actually spent a long time thinking about
it, and something was wrong with the way it had all went down.</p><P>As he walked, he noticed
that he was getting a lot of attention. After all, he was wearing a
deep green kimono with dark blue patterned hakama. On top of that, he
had his glasses on, and his hair pulled back in a low ponytail. His
ever present book was in his hand. For some reason though, the
fangirls who used to dog his steps everywhere stared in awe now. Did
he really look all that different?</p><P>Something caught his eye. 
He went over to the shop, and in the window, he saw it. It was
perfect, and he smiled, a small Uchiha smile. It was a small, golden
earring. It had a beautiful dangler on it, shaped like a feather. 
The feather was based off of a hawks, and it was utterly
breathtaking. Smiling at the woman, he asked her how much.</p><P>But for some strange
reason, the woman was intent on staring.</p><P>"How much for the
earrings?" He asked, starting to become a little annoyed.</p><P>"Ano...Um, are you
Uchiha Sasuke-san, by any chance?" She quivvered, as if unable
to make up her mind whether she should ask or not.</p><P>"Yes, that's me.
Why?" He said, his suspicions aroused. However, he really
shouldn't have gotten defensive, because the minute he affirmed her
suspicions, she swooned, and Sasuke could almost SEE the hearts in
her eyes.</p><P>"Oh, for you,
Uchiha-san, only five hundred Ryo!" She exclaimed, trying to
gain favor with the uchiha heir. She had noticed his georgeousness
before, when he walked in, but now, he had prestige with it. Sasuke
was very scared, very, very scared.</p><P>Buying the earrings
quickly, he placed them inside the white bundle in his sleeve as he
left the shop. However, it was soon realised within the town that
Uchiha Sasuke had returned. Sasuke was forced to endure the same
love-sick stares he had been before, only now, he had no patience for
it. After all, none of these creatures were even half as beautiful as
either Kyuubi OR Naruto. Not only that, he had a way to revive his
clan AND have those who loved him.</p><P>All was good in the world.</p><P>Or, so he thought.</p><P>As soon as he turned a
corner, trying to escape the stares he was receiving, he ran smack
into someone. Someone large, and wearing all black. Sasuke's initial
instinct was to go on the offensive, which he followed. He didn't
visually do so, but his hand slipped behind him to his weapons pouch,
and his eyes slid easily into their sharingan form.</p><P>Only to deactivate the
minute he saw who it was.</p><P>It was the spiky ponytail
that gave it away, that and the scar across the bridge of his nose.
After all, it was pretty hard not to remember the teacher who
basically took him and Naruto under his wing, like sons.</p><P>"Sasuke!" Iruka
cried, utterly surprised. Said raven sighed. Was he really that easy
to recognise? (Yes, Sasuke, you are. Get over it. It tends to happen
when one has hair shaped like a duck's ass. -Otaku) He was about to
sweatdrop, instead, reverting back to his old habit of using the
ancient Uchiha language!</p><P>"Hn." He
replied. He wasn't quite sure how his family came up with their
ability to express everything in one syllable or less, but there were
ancient stories, depicting one of his ancestors learning it from a
very short demon. (Slight crossover with Yu Yu Hakusho, right there!
The short demon would be Hiei! -evil grin- -Otaku)</p><P>"You're back! Does
the Hokage know? Wait! If you're back that means Naruto is too,
right?! WHERE IS HE?!" Iruka rushed, his mind whirring at a
thousand miles an hour. He wanted his Naru-chan, dammit! Yes, he
loved Sasuke just as dearly as Naruto, but Sasuke had Kakashi as more
of a father figure, and Kakashi had never really been as close as he
was to Naruto.</p><P>"Yes, Iruka-sensei,
Naruto is back, and yes, we have the Hokage's permission." 
Sasuke stalled him. He wasn't sure if Naruto wanted to see his old
sensei/mother-figure yet. After all, there was the fact that Naruto
was a mother himself now. How would Iruka react to that, he
wondered? Perhaps it would be best if Sasuke smoothed it all over
first, so Naruto didn't get hurt even more, if said mother-figure
should reject him. If the teacher did, Sasuke would just severely
injure him, and then keep Naruto away from him for the remainder of
their peacetalks with Konoha.</p><P>"Why don't we go
somewhere and catch up?" Sasuke said, pushing his glasses up his
nose. (Sorry, guys, if I didn't mention it before, but Sasuke wears
magnifying glasses, so that he can read really tiny print should he
find it. Plus, he looks really sexy in glasses...drools -Otaku)</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>A single midnight black
eyebrow arched at the form in front of him. Orochimaru was highly
interested in this strange, beautiful creature before him. It was
rather...interesting, really. The form was utterly divine, and the
way it held itself in front of him, was utterly splendid.</p><P>The demon was a welcome
sight, and he stood, to receive his message.</p><P>Sesayoi had brought
interesting news to the mortal, clothed in his half-snake form. The
naga-like male, white as the snake-god of rebirth (spoilers for
anyone who has read far enough in Shippuuden!! -Otaku), his white
hair spilling about him, his white as snow kimono flowing about him.</p><P>"So, you see, things
have shifted beyond your knowledge in this little mortal game you
play." Sesayoi hissed, looking very pleased with himself.</p><P>"And why should I
beleive a demon, especially one who brings such sad tidings about my
old teacher." Orochimaru posed, his head tilting suspiciously. 
The silver-maned demon reared up, his scales sliding along the stone
of the floor in Orochimaru's 'throne room'.</p><P>His dark, swirling eyes
sparkled, and he smiled creully, "I know it because I was in the
Kitsunegakure, as the message was delivered to the newly crowned
princes of the kitsune."</p><P>This caused Orochimaru to
become VERY excited. From what his spies inside the shinobi nations
told him, the kitsune had recently claimed Uchiha Sasuke for their
own. If he could just wrangle the boy away...</p><P>"Sadly, this was just
after he was mated to the lord of the kitsune, Kyuubi-san."</p><P>Orochimaru's suddenly
uplifted mood was just as suddenly deflated, because now, he had no
chance. Not even his curse-seals could tear apart a mating mark of
the demonic variety. He was at a loss. Not only was the elder Uchiha
out of his grasp, now so was the younger. Damn it all!</p><P>"Worry not, however,
because it appears there are far more interesting things going down
in Konoha, Orochimaru-kun. I'd be willing to lend you my help...for
a price." The snake proposed, his head back, exposing his long,
lean throat. The golden eyes of the former Sannin narrowed in
suspicion once again.</p><P>"And what price might
this be?" Orochimaru's voice was that of one used to making
treacherous deals, and used to listening for any tiny trick. Sesayoi
himself was one who had the same voice. This caused the snake-demon
to smile.</p><P>"Simple. When we
defeat the Kitsune-King, I want his lands and people as my own. You
may claim whatever human lands you wish, but leave the demonic planes
to myself."</p><P>Ah, a simple deal, then,
and one that might later leave the dark-maned man in a bind. Should
Sesayoi betray him later, he would be forced to fight the demon lord,
possibly with the whole of his newly combined armies. He could not
handle taking down both the snake-kingdom as well as the
kitsune-kingdom.</p><P>"On one condition, my
dear friend." Orochimaru proposed, and upon receiving a nod from
Sesayoi, he continued, "You must swear you will never double
cross me."</p><P>Sesayoi flared, his hood
shooting out behind his head, and he hissed, low and menacing. How
DARE this mortal ask that of him!</p><P>"You know not what
you ask, mortal child!" He hissed, his face coming all the
closer to Orochimaru's own. "I could very simply eat you, and
wear your skin, taking all that you have for my own. I need not swear
such a paltry oath!"</p><P>Orichimaru's head chibi
(OMG...That has to be the ugliest head chibi, EVER. -Otaku) had
already commenced running around in terrified circles, leaving the
Orochimaru that everyone else saw to be calm, and calculating.</p><P>"Alright, if you will
not swear to never double cross me, then instead give me a ten year
leave from any attacks on your part, once we part ways. I will swear
the same, and we will seal it in blood." Orochimaru posed, his
hand waving towards the snake lord, as if offering some great tidbit.</p><P>Sesayoi was utterly
revulsed by this human. He was almost...almost like one of his own.
And that made Sesayoi loathe the man all the more. However, he
agreed. He verbally swore, which was all that was needed to bind him
in oath. His very nature altered, that he would hold the contract,
no matter what happened. Orochimaru had ten years of peace, before
Sesayoi came for his head. THAT he would grant.</p><P>Signing the contract in
blood, Orochimaru smirked. Uchiha, hell. He had a MUCH better weapon
now. Konoha would FALL.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Naruto, having handed Yoh
over to Tsubasa for the day, was re-exploring his old home. He was
utterly amazed that so little had changed in the almost-year he was
gone. Everything was exactly as he remembered it! (minus the grafiti
of course. He hadn't been there to write it, now had he? -Otaku)</p><P>Kakashi had gone with him,
along with Haku and Tohru. The two boys had decided that a shopping
spree was necessary, since this was technically now a tourist
destination for them! So, they began dragging the important-looking
Naruto around the entire shopping district of Konoha.</p><P>It appalled them to find
that no one would let them buy anything, so long as Naruto was with
them. The shop-keep would take one look at Naruto's smiling,
whiskered face, and order them out, as fast as possible. They were
quite lucky that Zabuza wasn't there, nor Kyuubi. The two,
hot-tempered males would have threatened the poor mortals into
submission.</p><P>As it was, Haku, sweet,
diligent little Haku, was getting to the point where he had
threatened to strangle the next shopkeep that didn't let them shop.</p><P>So, Naruto, intelligent
boy that he was, took them to the training grounds, so that they
could avoid the senseless destruction of a shop, and concentrate,
rather, on the senseless destruction of the training dummies.</p><P>"You guys trained
with dummies? I had to learn on real ninja..." Haku commented, a
frown on his face, as he poked on of the dolls in the head. Tohru
and Naruto shared a look of utter horror, imagining an adorable
little Haku shoving a Kunai up some poor asshole's...well...asshole.</p><P>"Aheh...Well, I
personally, have many very interesting memories of this place. This
was where Kabuto-sempai taught me his secret trick!" Tohru
announced, trying to keep Haku from those VERY strange years that
passed as a childhood for him.</p><P>"Oh? What technique?"
Naruto chirped, bouncing up and down. He had a very deep interest in
techniques of all types, and he wondered what kind of technique this
Kabuto-guy had taught the aquamarine-colored shinobi. Tohru rarely
fought, and when he did, Naruto always had the impression that he
held back.</p><P>Tohru smiled, a
lovestruck, sappy smile, that reminded Naruto alot of the looks
Tsubasa gave mochi(sweet, sticky rice-candy), and said, "He
taught me how to control the regeneration of my cells, so that I
could replace all the dying cells in my body with newly grown ones!"</p><P>Haku gasped, utterly
horrified, and Naruto blinked. "Wait, a minute. What? What's
wrong, Haku? And why would you need to replace...cells...and stuff,
Tohru?!"</p><P>Tohru sighed heavily, as
if he was not only used to this kind of questioning, but also rather
tired of it. "I have a degenerative disease, Naruto. That means
that the cells in my body die off, a lot faster than normal cells. I
am constantly dying, and should have been laid up in the hospital
before I reached twelve. However, Kabuto-sempai taught me a jutsu to
speed up my natural healing processes. I heal, just as quickly as I
die, now. The reason Haku-chan is surprised, is because this jutsu
takes years off of my life in the future. So, if I would have lived
until I was thirty, but was bedridden, and unable to do anything, I
can instead live until I am fifteen, able to walk, talk and be a
useful Ninja. Do you understand?"</p><P>Naruto did, and he too was
horrified. He could only imagine what the poor genin was going
through. Naruto, through his mating with Kyuubi would live a much
longer life than that of any normal human, which made it even harder
for him to understand how the blue-eyed boy could stand there, and
smile, while accepting that he was going to die, and probably a lot
sooner than any of them.</p><P>"There was a reason I
chose to become a shinobi, you know. I wanted to die on my own
terms. Not from some illness, no. I wanted to die by the hands of my
enemies, while defending what was precious to me. You, Sasuke-kun,
the Foxes, my faeries, they have all become precious to me now, and I
can live, so long as I know I will die defending them." Tohru
offered, by way of explanation. This, however, just made Naruto's
heart hurt worse. Here was a boy, so young, yet so...casual about his
own death.</p><P>Tears slid down Naruto's
cheeks, even as his sky-blue eyes held resolve. His fists clenched
so hard, blood flowed from his fingertips. Naruto looks directly into
Tohru's eyes, surprising the other.</p><P>"You will not die an
unfulfilled life, Tohru-chan. This, I vow!"</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>(Warning: In this section
there will be lemon. Not by any means a big one, but still. If you
don't like it, then you really need to skip it. I will warn you
before the lemon, and after it. Okay? -Otaku)</p><P>"After you took
Naruto under your wing, the violence against him didn't stop, it just
dulled for a while. When he and I became friends, he was so adept at
hiding it, I didn't realise what the villagers were doing to him
until several months later. A little less than a year ago, Naruto
was dealt another blow, this time by ninja of our village, and he was
forced to leave for his own safety. I tried to go with him, but got
caught."</p><P>Sasuke's story was drawing
the interest of everyone in Ichiraku's. Ayame and her father had
missed the little blonde, he was their best customer, and was almost
like a little brother to Ayame. Kankuro was just finding it amazing
that someone other than Gaara got that kind of treatment. Temari was
utterly apalled, and forced herself to ignore that her own people did
the same thing. Gaara was less interested in the story, and more the
storyteller. The raven-haired male was beautiful, and smelled
strangely enough, of a mixture of beta and alpha scents. He also,
strangely enough, was marked by the Kyuubi no Kitsune, one of the
nine most powerful demons in the world, as his mate!</p><P>"Kyuubi led Naruto
and I to his secret village, after I managed to meet up with him.
There, we've been living for a long while now, and Naruto even has a
child. He's caring for Yoh spectacularly, Iruka-sensei. You taught
him well. He has a husband, as well, and he and I are married. Or,
will be, as soon as we complete the ceremony."</p><P>"Wait a minute.
Homosexual marriage is illegal in fire country." Iruka said,
shaking his head. All these changes in his little foster son's life,
and he wasn't there. A baby, marriage, TWO marriages..."And so
is polygamy!!"</p><P>Sasuke shook his head,
smiling a small uchiha smile, "It isn't in Kitsunegakure, or in
the demon realms."</p><P>Iruka gaped. Then, he
settled into his ramen, thinking pretty hard. But only one thing
really mattered to the brnette teacher.</p><P>"Is he happy,
Sasuke-kun?" Iruka asked, totally focused, yet not looking at
the Uchiha heir. The dark-haired boy was surprised by the question,
and actually had to think.</p><P>He smiled again, as he
answered, "Yeah. Yeah, he is. Not the happy you're used to,
but he's happy. But, he still has a lot to work through. These
villagers did horrible things to him, Iruka-sensei, and he really
needs support right now. So...If you can't accept the way his life is
now...Perhaps, it would be best if you sta-"</p><P>"If you're going to
tell me to stay away from Naruto, you might as well swallow your
words now, Sasuke-kun. As you just said, Naruto needs support. And
who better to give it, than an old teacher?" Iruka smiled at the
former Konoha-nin.</p><P>The sand clone Gaara had
left in his place was surprised. The conversation then ran as
normal, and Sasuke began to talk less, and less. This was Gaara's
chance.</p><P>Sasuke's mind began to
wander off, mostly to what his mates might be up to. He only vaguely
paid attention to the conversation, or to any of the others in the
ramen shop. That is, until something brushed his knee...</p><P>Start the lemons!!! (Said
like a race-car announcer)</p><P>He jumped, only slightly.
Had you not been able to speak the ancient Uchiha-language, you
wouldn't have noticed it. However, Gaara, quite fluent in it's sister
language, "Stoic Psycho", understood perfectly, and
smirked. He continued with his actions, untying the usually calm
Uchiha's hakama, and pulling them down, just enough to get at his
prize.</p><P>Gaara did something
utterly uncharacteristic then. He blushed. Not that anyone could see
him, he was on his knees under the counter, but still. Shukaku
teased him about it, mentally.</p><P>Getting over his small
bout of shyness, Gaara went ahead with his plan, licking his plump
lips, tasting the sand that was constantly around him. That small,
pink tongue ventured from those lips, and touched the skin of the
Uchiha's manhood, causing a small, nearly silent, yet sharp intake of
breath from the dark-haired male.</p><P>Again, Gaara's mouth
formed into a smile, and he licked again, more deliberately this
time, at the head of Sasuke's cock. He felt the dark-haired male
clench his muscles, trying to stave off a shiver, and trying to keep
control over himself.</p><P>Sasuke couldn't figure out
who the fuck it was! Gaara was down the counter from him, quietly
eating his ramen, his brother and sister were on the other side of
him, and Iruka was between himself and the redhead. Who was licking
at him, so innocently (well, not innocent, really, but
still...-Otaku)?!</p><P>Gaara took the head of the
erection into his mouth, for now it was indeed a full-fledged
erection. His tongue swirled, slow, and easy, over the slit, and the
skin surrounding it, tasting. The Uchiha had a musky taste, a
strange mixture of sweat and something...unnameable. The
possessed-nin found he quite enjoyed the taste, and the heavy feel of
the organ as it slid along his tongue, causing unseen tremors to pass
through the raven-haired boy.</p><P>Pulling another inch or
two into his mouth, Gaara rolled it around, pressing it lightly
against the roof of his mouth, while his tongue drew small designs on
the bottom, teasing the skin there. Meanwhile, his hand reached up,
into the hakama around his victim's waist, and cupped the heavy balls
underneath, rolling them as well, lightly squeezing them, massaging
shoots of pleasure up Sasuke's spine. His other hand occupied itself
with kneading at the Sharingan-heir's thigh, setting a fast, yet
soothing pace with his strokes, a hint of what's to come.</p><P>Taking in more of the
husky dick, Gaara found that he was near the point where he would
begin gagging. So, taking it slow, he began playing with the length
in his mouth, relaxing his throat to take in more. The Uchiha, who
happened to be in heaven, was shaking, trying hard not to make a
sound, or to shake too much. It would be utterly embarrassing to
admit he was being molested under the table, and the shame to his
family name would be endless. Not to mention what would happen to
him if Kyuubi thought he was cheating on him...</p><P>The Uchiha was by no means
small, rather, a pretty five or six inches, but Gaara took it slow,
torturing the raven with his tongue all the while, slowly, slowly,
swallowing him whole. Sasuke didn't know if he could take any more,
it was intense, the heat, the moist, sweet tongue wrapping around
him, he was sure he was panting. He let one of his hands slip down,
into the short hair of his assailant. If he was going to be violated,
the least he could do was control the speed.</p><P>Taking hold of the head,
he subtly arched his hips, jumping up, deeper into that heavenly
mouth, causing just the tiniest noise of complaint to slip from under
the table. He let the head retreat a little bit, before pulling it
closer, feeling soft, plump lips that strangely enough scratched him,
meet the base of his cock. Feeling just a little more control slip
into his grasp, he smirked, small enough no one noticed, and began
guiding the assailant in a faster, luscious mockery of a mating.</p><P>Gaara was surprised that
Sasuke would do something like this, take advantage of someone taking
advantage of him, but he supposed it was all within his personality
if one looked. Shukaku chuckled in the back of his mind, and Gaara
growled, low and quiet, but it shivvered up the dick in his mouth,
causing Sasuke to straighten suddenly. Luckily, Kankurou had
distracted Iruka and Temari in a conversation about various teaching
practices, so none of the other ninja noticed.</p><P>Gaara's rythm was thrown
off now, as Sasuke controlled the speed with which he sucked in the
former Avenger, and pulled off, but he had to admit, the raven had an
interesting rythm of his own, a quick, broken tattoo that reminded
Gaara of a heartbeat. He followed along, hallowing out his throat,
and suddenly, just as he felt Sasuke's balls contract, he swallowed,
sending the Uchiha over the edge, smirking.</p><P>Sasuke groaned, low, and
almost painful, his essence exploding into the redhead's waiting
mouth. Swallowing the milky, bitter seed, Gaara grinned as Iruka
turned to the Uchiha, a concerned look on his face.</p><P>"What's wrong,
Sasuke?" Iruka asked, hearing the 'pain' in the groan, and
wondering what was wrong with his former student. BAki turned and
looked as well, followed by his three students. He turned to look at
them, and waved his old teacher's worries off.</p><P>"I just remembered
something I promised to teach Tsubasa. Sorry." Sasuke said,
the lie rolling off his tongue easily.</p><P>"Oh? Who's Tsubasa?"
Iruka said, and Sasuke successfully passed off his (essentially)
rape, without anyone being the wiser. The Gaara clone left,
apperantly for the bathroom of a nearby shop, and returned, looking
somewhat self-satisfied (again, only to those who can speak Uchiha,
or it's several sister-dialects. -Otaku).</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Kyuubi suddenly felt very
wrong. A shivver passed through him, and an anger deeper than any
other he had ever felt. But he controlled it. He was sure it was
from dealing with these idiotic, grovelling, yet somehow arrogant
council members. Since Kyuubi was in essence, equal, if not above
Kage rank (The five leaders of the five great Shinobi villages),
Tsunade had sent him on his own to deal with the stupid council.</p><P>Luckily, he had Zabuza
with him, as a bodygaurd, who looked rather threatening, whenever he
wasn't making eyes at his little brunette. Now, he had both the
intimidating factor he himself gave off, but also that of his
bodygaurd adding to his own.</p><P>"You want us to
what?" One of the council members said, obviously more than a
little miffed at what the ancient demon was asking of them.</p><P>Kyuubi sighed, rubbing the
bridge of his nose, feeling a headache coming on, "I very simply
want to forge an alliance with Konoha, and as such, wish to put a
team of Shinobi into the Chuunin exams. They are human, so they will
have no advantages to your teams, though that should hardly be any of
your concern. The team consists of Uzumaki Naruto, Uchiha Sasuke,
and Kasuki Tohru."</p><P>The council gasped,
clammoring among itself, the names wringing havock within the old
timers. They feared the first, revered the second, and barely knew
the third. However, anyone could tell that this team would wipe the
floor with their own teams.</p><P>"And why should we
allow three s-class missing-nin to participate in the Chuunin exams?"
One old female dared to question, her bravery a facade that Kyuubi
could smell the fear from.</p><P>"Simply because they
are not missing-nin any longer. They are Kitsunegakure nin, and have
my complete backing. I think that should be quite enough for you."</p><P>The council debated, yet
again. Finally, they came to a descision.</p><P>An old man, by his looks,
most likely one of the two heads-of-council, stood, and stared down
the Kyuubi with disguised fear, and foolish bravery.</p><P>"We will allow it.
But be warned, this is a temporary truce, and should you do anything
to break it, we will use all our might to stomp you into the ground,
and re-seal you. Do you understand?"</p><P>Kyuubi grinned, and
suddenly began bouncing around like a teenage girl who just got her
way. He was giggling, and burst out of the dark, smoky council-room,
into the bright sunshine with a loud whoop, and took off running. His
bodygaurd walked out after him, grinning too, and shaking his head, 
leaving the elders of Konoha completely, absolutely, speechless.</p><P>One thought prevailed over
them all.</p><P>'THIS was what killed our
beloved Yondaime?!'</p><P>End Chapter </p><P>Otaku: -falls over
laughing at the image of Kyuubi giggling like a schoolgirl-</p><P>Kyuubi: -grins- Yeah, I
did good on that one, huh?</p><P>Naruto: -Laughing his ass
off- Oh yeah, big guy, you definately did!</p><P>Otaku: -dries eyes- Okay!
Yeah! Anywho, just to let you guys know, next comes the Chuunin exam
arch! The first test, let's see how everyone's gonna do, shall we?!
YEAH!!</p><P>Sasuke: -Stares at Otaku
with a 'What the fuck is it and get it the fuck off me!' expression-</p><P>See y'all!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 16</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
Sorry it took so long to get up, I have a job now, and sadly, don't
have near as much time to write. So, for those of you who read my
Run Away story, as well as any other story, like this one and To
Catch a Dolphin, the updates are gonna get scarce here for a while,
till I get used to the workload.</p><P>Kits!</p><P>Pairings:
Lots, check the chapters before. Mainly though: 
KyuuNaruSasuGaaShuka.</p><P>Warnings:
This chapter has an overall insanity rating, and just a twinge of AU,
mostly because I'm going off of what I remember of the first test.</p><P>Description:
 It's time for the first test, and tension is running high! What will
Team Kitsune do?!</p><P>Disclaimer:
Y'know, if I owned Naruto, he probably would've gotten pregnant a lot
sooner...</p><P>Kits!
Chapter 16</p><P>Sakura
was beyond pissed. Not only was her mistress banned from watching
the first and second tests, she herself had to join up with a team,
in order to join in! ARGH!!! And even worse yet, was this annoying
brat who was her teammate!</p><P>He
called himself Sai and smiled, all the time, just like Naruto used
to! Sakura couldn't stand it! Not to mention that the guy seemed to
have no concept of what human interaction was, and he was constantly
calling her names! The only thing that kept him alive (aside from his
extensive supply of Inky pets) was her Mistress' express orders to
let him be.</p><P>That
didn't stop her from torturing her other teammate, though. He was a
nobody, barely even on the roster anyway, so what did it matter that
he was both utterly afraid of her, as well as completely smitten with
her? He made good cannon fodder.</p><P>So,
when it came time to join in, to head to the test room, she had no
problem pushing her way through the groups that had randomly shown
up. It was rather strange, all of them gathering one floor below
where they needed to be. She passed them by, and caught Sai giving
them a creepy smile out of the corner of her eye. That boy was on
crack or something, she swore.</p><P>Just
as team seven passed by, however, team kitsune was just showing up. 
Naruto, clad in a really short battle-kimono and his long hair
bouncing free, a care-free smile on his face, skidded to a halt in
front of the door that the two 'older students' were gaurding.</p><P>Sasuke
followed after, in a much longer kimono of a deep blue hue with the
fan-symbol on it's back, his own long hair in a short braid,
hopefully staying out of his way. He shook his head and pushed his
glasses up his nose, adjusting Tsubasa in his other arm, who gave a
sleepy gurgle. He shot a short glance at Tohru, who looked almost in
pain.</p><P>Tohru
took another swig from his Spring Water, and felt a whole lot better.
As always, he felt the cells in his body begin to start growing
again, and he gave a sigh of releif, the two faeries on his shoulders
twittering happily that their master was out of pain now.</p><P>The
group stared at the newcomers as the pretty blonde stood in front of
the two gaurds, blinking confusedly.</p><P>"Why's
everyone gathered here? Isn't the test on the third floor?"
Naruto asked, utterly confused. He really didn't understand why
everyone was standing out here, for no apperant reason. He glanced
around, and found that most of the faces here were foreigners. Some
from Rock, others from Rain, even a few from Sound...A strange
assortment, but there were also the few Leaf gennin who seemed
tricked by this as well.</p><P>Sasuke
soon realised what was going on, and scoffed. Konoha really had
produced some below average Ninja, if they couldn't even recognise a
genjutsu. He formed the hand-sign, and muttered, "Kai!"
releasing the jutsu, for him atleast, which allowed him to see both
the two men as well as the door properly.</p><P>The
gennin began doing the same, seeming to have caught the hint, and
began scattering, muttering obsenities. Sasuke almost growled, aching
to instill manners in them. Who cusses in front of an infant, for
god's sake?! He followed after his blonde, however, still faintly
uncomfortable.</p><P>He
hadn't told Naruto, or Kyuubi, about his molestation/rape, at the
hands of some unknown assailant. No, he couldn't say the assailant
was unknown. He had a pretty decent notion that it was Subaku no
Gaara. But why would the notoriously psycho sand-nin suck him off in
a public place?!</p><P>Even
worse, he hadn't asked Kyuubi about his clan yet, or gotten even
remotely close to it. The fox spent most of his time inside Naruto's
mindscape, apperantly trying his hardest to avoid making the village
uncomfortable. He wanted to avoid the wrath of the leaf-village
falling on his innocent blonde counterpart.</p><P>Entering
the room where the remainder of the contestants were gathered was
easy, no gaurds at the door or anything. Inside there were upwards of
fifty, maybe even sixty three-man teams. All of them were tense, as
if preparing for a fight.</p><P>Tohru
was tense as well. If anyone dared to attack the two fox-princes, he
would be forced to step in the way of the attack. His body really
couldn't handle that right now, not after the long bout of travelling
that had forced his immune system a lot lower than it had any right
to be.</p><P>He
nearly flinched when a great, green thing bobbed up out of no where,
and began speaking!</p><P>Lee
had been waiting for this moment! To meet the infamous Sasuke Uchiha,
rookie of his year, just as his teammate Neji had been! He must
surely be a genius! And therefore, he must beat him!</p><P>Naruto
shushed the great green beast, the minute he opened his mouth.</p><P>"Can't
you see my baby is sleeping! Keep it down!" He hissed, a glare
to rival any mothers shooting through the beautiful green beast of
Konoha. A distinct snort came from somewhere behind the
green-clothed male, as a small, twin-bunned, brunette girl shot
forward, cooing over Yoh, as most females were want to do. The
scoffing noise however, had not come from the female, but rather from
a long-haired, white eyed male.</p><P>Neji
was irrationally angered by the blonde. He knew that it wasn't
against the rules to bring other living beings, but still, a CHILD?! 
Was this blonde asking for the death of his so called 'baby'?</p><P>Kiba
caught a strange scent and went to investigate. His team followed
along behind him, and strangely enough, he found the scent mingled
with that of Hinata's cousin, and the bushy-browed freak.</p><P>It
was Naruto! And Sasuke, as well, all returned, safe and sound! He had
heard from the gaurd-dogs that they were back, but he hadn't really
beleived it, after all, dogs gossiped worse than women. But
strangely enough, there was a baby with them...And it smelled like a
little Naruto! Only, that strange scent in Naruto, the cloyingly
deep one, the one that instilled fear in Kiba was stronger in the
child...almost like the child was half Naruto, and half whatever it
was Kiba feared in the blonde.</p><P>That
in turn unsettled him, and Shino's hand on his shoulder was the only
thing that kept him from openly growling. Shino himself, was a
little unsettled as well. The faeries, sweet little Aurora and quiet
Hidari, were both sitting on this aqua haired boy's shoulders. 
Aurora was toying with his short hair, braiding it and unbraiding it
over and over, humming in her small voice, while Hidari just watched
his Life-Companion play.</p><P>So,
this small, sickly green-eyed male was Tohru, the creator of these
beautiful insects? Strange...</p><P>Gaara
was interested as well, but for entirely different reasons. The
Uchiha's mate was just as attractive as the dark-haired male, though
in a much lighter way. That child was a problem though. It would get
in the way, if Shukaku and Gaara were to try and claim the blonde. 
He would have to get rid of it. However, there was also the slight
problem of the whiff of demonic aura about the two. That was what had
first attracted Shukaku's attention, and therefore, Gaara's as well. 
But something in them both told them that whiff was dangerous.</p><P>Temari
was minding her brothers carefully. Strangely enough, it seemed as
if the two of them were calm, and for Gaara that was freaky in and of
itself. Gaara was never calm. He was either brooding, killing, or
staring. Well, he was staring right now, at that strange little
blonde girl who came in with a baby, but still. And what's worse,
Kankuro was checking out women! URGH!!</p><P>And
what a woman it was...nice breasts, good hips, short, jaunty pink
hair, and gorgeous green eyes. What can he say, he likes green eyes!
(INCEST!!! giggles -Otaku) She was perfect. And she had just the
slightest hint of attitude, too. To tell the truth, she reminded him
of a female Gaara, just a little bit. That danger though is what
made her so...alluring.</p><P>He
grinned.</p><P>He
was about to make his move, when in came a group of jounin, all of
which carried clipboards, except one. He stood, tall and broad
shouldered, his face clean-cut and unscarred, a relative oddity in
the Ninja world. His spikey brown hair stood on end, and he smiled a
smile that made everyone cringe at the thought of him being angry
with them.</p><P>"Asses,
chairs. Eyes, me. NOW!!" His voice cut through the chatter, the
confusion, and strangely, most obeyed. The few who didn't were
quickly ejected from the room.</p><P>Naruto
watched the man, bouncing Yoh up and down, for the boy was being
strangely fussy today. The Jounin grinned, another shiver tracing up
everyone's spines.</p><P>"Nice
to meetcha! My names Morino Shusuke, but you can call me Shu-sensei!
Shut up and listen, cause I'm only explaining this once.</p><P>This
is a written test, ten questions. You have three hours to take the
test, and the tenth question will be given after two and a half hours
pass. You start with a hundred points. Ten for each question you
answer. If you are caught cheating, twenty five points are deducted.
 If you run out of points, you fail. Simple, neh?"</p><P>He
paused, as if waiting for an answer. Thankfully, no one bothered
answering, and he grinned again. The crowd murmered gently, as he
raised an arm in the air.</p><P>"However,
it's not quite that simple. You see, if you fail, so does your
entire team. All of you, gone, just like that. And now...</p><P>"Begin!"
He called, bringing his arm down quickly.</p><P>The
first thing Sasuke realised, was that the questions on the test were
by far too complicated to answer properly without cheating. The
second was that he could cheat a total of four times before the
proctors kicked him and the others out. The third was that Naruto
could not possibly pass this test.</p><P>Naruto's
best chance would be the last question.</p><P>Naruto,
sad to say, realised this too, and so, instead of even bothering to
do anything other than write down his own name, he concentrated on
keeping Yoh quiet. He glanced around the room, which was abnormally
quiet. Everyone was concentrating, or appeared to be, atleast.</p><P>Hinata
noticed that Naruto had nothing written down. She had already used
Byakugan to check the proctors note-books, and managed to find three
answers, relatively quickly.</p><P>"Naruto-kun...You
can...copy my a-a-answ-answers, if...If you want..." She
stammered, slow.</p><P>Naruto
blinked. Hinata...A weird girl who always blushed and stammered
around him. He never really knew why, but...if she was offering help,
then perhaps he should take it.</p><P>No...That
would be...wrong. Deceitful. He smiled at her, and shook his head.</p><P>"No,
Hinata. That's ok. I'll make it on the tenth question. After all, I
wouldn't want a strong girl like you getting disqualified because of
me." He whispered, casting a quick glance to everyone, checking
out the situation.</p><P>Tohru
seemed to be done, as if he had answered all the questions. He was
now sleeping, his head down on the desk, with Aurora and Hidari
playing on the desk in front of him.</p><P>Sasuke
was using his sharingan to copy a particularly smart looking person,
and was writing down their answers.</p><P>Gaara
had formed an eyeball out of sand, and was now watching people,
writing down their answers, with a clear, emotionless look on his
face.</p><P>Kiba's
dog was talking to him, giving the answers easily, from his
advantageous perch on top of Kiba's head.</p><P>It
was Ino that was having the problem. She had intended to possess
Sakura, the biggest brained girl in their year, figuring easy
answers. Problem was, Sakura was keeping her out. It was utterly
useless! And on top of that, she had a total of five minutes before
she could get back to her body! Dammit. She possessed Chouji, and
left him a note, before doing the same with Shikamaru. They would
have to gamble on the tenth question.</p><P>Kankuro
raised a hand.</p><P>One
of the procters came over, and he whispered something. The procter
nodded, and handcuffed Kankuro, leading him out of the room. Both
Naruto, and Kiba had noticed that the procter was fake. After all, a
doll smelled different from a human. It was just that simple. Now,
Kankuro was getting the answers to the questions, laughing it up in
the bathroom.</p><P>Slowly,
the hours passed, and quite a number of teams had been disqualified. 
Finally, it came time for the tenth question. The proctor once again
called them all to attention, and smiled, that same, slow, insane
smile.</p><P>"Alright.
It's time for the tenth question. But first, you must decide if you
want to take it."</p><P>"What
do you mean, it's just a question!" Someone shouted. Shusuke
grinned, his eyes taking on a hard edge, as he continued.</p><P>"Well,
you see, this is no ordinary question. You can choose to not take
the question, and leave now, you and your team, with a chance at
trying again next year. Or, you can choose to take it, and, if you
fail it, never again take the chuunin exam."<p></p><P>This
caused just a hint of discord among the room. Everyone was murmuring
about it, and several shook their heads, apologising to teammates, as
they exited the room.</p><P>Kiba
was pissed. They came here to take the exam, to test their skills,
not to give up and wimp out!</p><P>"Look,
Mr. Proctor, we came here to take this damn test, and I sure as hell
am not going to let one little question fail me! Bring it on!" 
Kiba growled, standing, his palms slamming into the top of his desk
in frustration.</p><P>Naruto
smiled. That was almost exactly like something he would have said. 
He watched, as the mood in the room shifted. As the defeated air
lifted from the remaining teams, and people began to take courage
again.</p><P>"Alright,
no one else leaving?" The brunette asked. When no one got up,
and they all stared at him intently, he grinned, not his psycho grin
this time, but a real one, one that seemed almost like a father
smiling down at his child.</p><P>"Congratulations!
You all pass the first test!"</p><P>Half
the class sweatdropped, the other half face-faulted. However, they
didn't get a chance to question it, because, through the windows
along the side of the room, burst in another strange thing!</p><P>She
was pretty, in a strange, cocky way, her black hair tied up in a
spikey ponytail, and a trenchcoat open over fishnet, she grinned.</p><P>"Anko
Miturashi(I think this is her last name...-Otaku), procter for the
second exam, ready and able!" She announced.</p><P>End
Chapter </p><P>Otaku:
Sorry, but that was just the most perfectest way to end it. I agree
with Kishimoto-sensei on that one!</p><P>Kyuubi:
Aww... I got like...no screentime!</p><P>Naruto:
Yeah, but I got a lot of it!</p><P>Shikamaru:
Actually, if you look, most of it was the rookie nine, Gai's team and
the OC's.</p><P>Otaku:
Speaking of OC's...Sorry about Shusuke, but I needed a procter, and
I'd killed off the other Morino guy, so...It all worked out in the
end!</p><P>Anko:
Yeah! So...Where's my dango?</p><P>See
you all later!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 17</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
Okay, so I recently got a new job, and sadly, that means less updates
for you all. I DO intend to finish both Kits and Run Away, so I'm not
going to just drop them, but sadly, I will update less often, due to
stress and overwork. Sorry. However, I intend to step up with my
writing quality, so hopefully, you all will notice the change...</p><P>Kits!</p><P>Pairings:
Should be obvious by now, though now is about the time I start
defining the other pairings a little better.</p><P>Warnings:
Lots of stalking in this chappie, also, a whole bunch of gore and
killing. So...Have fun.</p><P>Description:
The second exam begins! Too bad most of the rookies won't make it
through the first night...Will they be able to handle the pressure,
or will some of them snap?</p><P>Disclaimer:
I don't own Naruto. You should be VERY thankful.</p><P>Kits!
Chap. 17</p><P>The
forest was huge, by normal standards, but for some reason, it just
made Naruto long for the cool dark forests of the Kitsune village. He
had taken long walks in them, when he was pregnant with Yoh, and they
never seemed deadly. Neither did this one, but really that was only
because he knew his scent alone would fend off most dangerous
creatures. He looked over to see Sasuke regarding it with cool black
eyes. He was probably thinking the same thing.</p><P>Taking
his last few moments with his child, Yoh gurgling in his mother's
arms, Naruto nuzzled his cheek, missing him already. He passed the
blue-eyed babe over to his father, Kyuubi no Kitsune, who all of the
other contestants were regarding with various degrees of suspicion.</p><P>A
pair of coal-black eyes regarded them with emotionless curiousity. 
Sai was sitting beside his female teammate, sharpening a kunai, as he
didn't want to reveal his talents just yet. He had been watching
Naruto with the baby, and strangely enough, had been overtaken with
an urge to paint it. But there would be time for that later, after
he'd finished Danzo-sama's mission. The growling coming from the
pink-haired girl next to him, however, was quickly irritating him.</p><P>Kiba
was lost. The entire feild smelled of far too many people, far too
many threats. He couldn't take it all, he was shaking. Akamaru whined
above kiba's head, looking down at his poor, frightened master.
Hinata put a calming hand on Kiba's shoulder, causing him to flinch,
and turn, snarling, towards her. It was only after he saw the look of
fear on her face that he realised what he had done. He apologised,
quietly, before sitting down, waiting for the damn instructor to
hurry up and show.</p><P>Tohru
was scanning the crowd, memorising the faces of potential threats to
his princes, and also, strangely enough, looking for some clue as to
who Shino Aburame was. Shino had never told him anything about
himself, and he couldn't remember the name from any of his classes in
Academy. He was curious who the man was, and what he was like in
person. Hidari tweaked his master's ear, and then tilted his head.</p><P>Tohru
understood it for what it was. Hidari was asking if Tohru wanted a
hint. The bluenette shook his head, smiling at the fae. He did
wonder where Aurora was though. She'd been missing for a few hours.
Probably out picking flowers for her hair. He watched as Kyuubi
kissed Naruto goodbye, and then Sasuke, both short and sweet, though
Sasuke looked just a tad bit uncomfortable with all those eyes on
him.</p><P>Then,
the teacher showed up. After a breif explanation of what the
'mission' was, they received their scrolls. He checked what type,
and it appeared to be an earth scroll. He quickly handed it to
Sasuke, who disguised it as a regular equipment scroll, and disguised
one of his regular reading scrolls into the guise of the earth
scroll. They went to find their gate.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Gaara
was antsy. Very antsy. Shukaku was giggling madly in the back of his
mind, and his mother was calling for blood. The sand rustled in his
gourd, a strange, hissing sound, like a snake slithering over fallen
leaves.</p><P>Temari
and Kankuro were abviously nervous, their homocidal little brother
already itching for blood. If they got in his way, he'd kill them,
they knew it. He'd threatened it before, and he was the most
powerful shinobi in their village, under their father.</p><P>Temari
wondered what would happen when they saw their father, finally, at
the end of this stupid exam? Would Gaara kill him? Would Father kill
Gaara? Would they finally reconcile? She scoffed at that idea. There
was a reason that the Kazekage hadn't met with his youngest child in
several years. And it had nothing to do with being to busy.</p><P>Kankuro
was just trying to minimise the damage as much as possible. He didn't
know what that monster inside of him was telling his little brother,
but he knew it couldn't be good. That monster had caused so much
trouble for Gaara, he didn't know how the red-head standed it. 
Kankuro didn't think that he could have survived it. He would have
killed himself pretty quickly after their uncle...Well, after that
fool of an uncle of theirs pulled a suicide mission. No one can kill
Gaara, that much Kankuro knows.</p><P>And
that much he was trying to inform these moronic Rock-nins. They had
decided that the only team from Sand must have been an easy target,
and now, they were antagonising Gaara. Not a good idea, and
unfortunately, they weren't listening to any warnings.</p><P>So,
Kankuro switched to Gaara, trying to warn him off of killing them,
knowing that they couldn't put their mission in danger. But Gaara was
listening either.</p><P>The
sand in the clearing answered his silent call, swarming the three
nin, and crushing them, absorbing the blood and bone, and all other
traces of their existance. Soon, it was like they'd never been there
at all. But that wasn't enough.</p><P>The
sand still rustled, pulling close to Gaara like a dog wanting
attention for a job well done. Gaara paid it no mind, his body still
quivvering from the lack of excitement in the battle. He wanted
blood. He wanted lots and lots of blood. He wanted screams of pain
and horrible wrenching of bones from the body. He didn't want near
silent deaths. His dark eyes slid to his siblings.</p><P>'They
mean nothing. You could kill them easily, and there would be no
problem. Just say they were killed in the exam. It's beleivable...'
Shukaku whispered, the excitement dripping off his tongue. If anyone
could provide the excitement his beloved vessel was looking for, his
siblings could...</p><P>"Gaara!
We have a mission!" Temari cried. For some reason, her voice
calmed him, a bit. Gaara always thought that Temari and Mother
sounded a lot alike. Soft and sweet, but a tinge of harshness, like
the desert air. They were the only ones that he listened to, besides
Shukaku. Shukaku never led him astray.</p><P>The
sand parted, just a bit, to reveal a small, brown scroll, with the
character for Earth on it. Kankuro picked it up, nervous about his
brothers deteriorating mind, but trusting Temari's tenuous hold on
his sanity. He would have laughed at the irony of Rock-nin having an
Earth scroll, but that might have thrown Gaara over the edge, and
they couldn't afford that.</p><P>They
moved on, jumping through the trees as quickly as possible, to reach
the tower, and the beginning of their mission.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Sai's
ink-beasts took out the rookie team easily, slaughtering the sound
nin, effortlessly. He nearly sighed with the monotony of this
mission. Danzo-sama had told him very simply, that he was to be part
of this team, indefinately, until a chance was gained to kill off the
Kyuubi-vessel, the renegade Uchiha, and Orochimaru. Hopefully, all in
one fell swoop. Sadly, he had seen no indication that that event was
coming any time soon.</p><P>However,
he had seen quite the indication that several of the Gennin were
going to end up rogue. Inuzuka, for example. He was already showing
classic signs of berserker. And the Hyuuga boy, the one from the
secondary branch. He too was showing signs of paranoia, as well as
strange behavioral patterns. They would have to be monitered closely.</p><P>No
threat to the leaf village would be tolerated.</p><P>Of
course, if Sakura didn't stop bitching, he might take it upon himself
to remove her from the picture as well. Casualties were well excepted
on this particular mission. In fact, they were expected, and in large
quantities, as well.</p><P>Sai
picked out the heaven scroll that they needed from the wreckage of
the former sound team, and wiped it off with the bandages on his
forearm. No sense in soaking it in ink, before they had to turn it
in, correct?</p><P>After
all, it was one less thing Sakura could bitch about.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>A
twig cracked, causing Kiba to jump, and growl. He hadn't stopped
twitching, growling and jumping since they entered the Forest of
Death. After all, anything could happen here. They could be killed,
and it would be written off as death in the line of duty. They'd get
no honor for it. They'd get no pride. It would be a senseless death.</p><P>And
even worse, Hinata would be hurt. Kiba knew this. He also knew he
couldn't let that happen. So what if he growled at every little
sound. So what if he snapped at his teammates, to silence them, just
in case. Hinata would be safe, and that's all that mattered.</p><P>Hinata,
though was worried, very worried. Kiba hadn't been the same
since...Well, for a rather long time. It was strange for him to be
this jumpy, and they couldn't afford for anything to go wrong here.
Here, they could die.</p><P>She
kept her Sharingan active as much as possible, checking all
directions for any possible threats, and also for any matching
scrolls.</p><P>Shino,
who was quiet, was also worried about his friend. Kiba had grown on
him in the time they had trained as a team. Kiba was a dear friend.
Possibly his best friend. But this was just strange for the boy. 
Kiba wasn't afraid of anything. Now, he was afraid of everything. It
just wasn't right. Something was very wrong. But there was nothing he
could do until the exam was over.</p><P>He
hoped they would survive that long.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>A
shadow moved, deep in the forest. A large beast, two tails swinging
idly about it's heavy body. The deep red fur on it made it appear
all the feircer, as it stalked, silent and deadly, through the
forest.</p><P>She
was on her way now. Soon, soon, she would have the bitch in her
grasp, and soon, she would rip away EVERYTHING that he held dear. 
She would tear out his beating heart and show him as his own filthy
half-breed son feasted on it, before he too died.</p><P>Kyuubi
be damned, that bitch owed a blood debt to her, and she would extract
it. Oh, how she would enjoy this...</p><P>End
Chapter </p><P>Otaku:
Wow...Tsumi is getting bloodthirsty, ain't she?</p><P>Tsumi:
You would too!</p><P>Otaku:
Yeah, I would. That's how I can write you properly. Dur!</p><P>Naruto:
-quirks eyebrow- Okay, so the reason you write most of us well, is
cause you'd do what we do?</p><P>Otaku:
-Nods-</p><P>Naruto:
Then, you'd murder hundreds of people, and save them at the same
time?</p><P>Otaku:
-sweatdrops- In my mind, I can do anything.</p><P>See

<br><br><h3>Chapter 18</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
Here's where the action starts kickin' in! And I want to apologise in
advance. I'm horrible at battle scenes. Anyway, no more about my
shortcomings, you all wanted to read the story!</p><P>Kits!</p><P>Pairings:
Figure it out!</p><P>Warnings:
Bitch-fight, plot twist!, and the strange turns one's mind can take.</p><P>Description:
Let's just say that the bed-guys are VERY busy this chapter!</p><P>Disclaimer:
If I owned Naruto, I would make a killing off of making Doujinshi
that looked a whole hell of a lot like the real thing! As it stands,
I do not. So therefore, I don't own Naruto, and therefore, you can't
sue me! HAH!</p><P>Kits!
Chapter 18</p><P>The
fox crashed through the forest, towards her goal. Only she knew what
she would do to them, only she knew the depth of her hatred for that
miserable human who stole her child, her tail, her life. A roar,
loud, high and utterly shaking, let loose from her throat, as she
finally found them.</p><P>Tohru
shivvered in abjunct fear, as whatever it was that had loosed such an
unearthly howl, approached, and fast. He...He couldn't afford to be
weak, he had to protect the two princes, but, how could he do that
with such primordial fear running through his body?! Whatever it was,
it was big, and it was evil, even the greenest academy student could
tell you that.</p><P>Naruto,
however, was completely floored. He knew that roar. All his life,
Kyuubi had given such helpless, hate-filled roars, before they'd
really communicated. It was the sound of a fox, in much, much pain.
Pain that no amount of healing would fix. He too, shivvered, but
stood his ground, judging the distance between it and them.</p><P>Sasuke,
however, was calm. He knew what it was. It was a beast. It was big.
It wasn't stupid, or animalistic, it was intelligent. He thought,
maybe, just maybe, if they did this right, they might be able to
negotiate with it.</p><P>Oh,
how wrong he was.</p><P>The
beast crashed through the forest, stopping the tree-carnage just feet
from them, who were standing in the top branches of one of the trees.
 It, or rather she, stopped right in front of them, her eyes glaring
dark and dangerous, as a deep, threatening rumble resounded from her
huge chest. Her lips curled back to show dangerous teeth, the size
of their forearms. Saliva dripped off of them, and sizzled as it hit
the forest floor.</p><P>"So...I
finally meet the whore who stole my life from me..." It was a
dark voice, a voice full of hatred and malice, and all three of them
shuddered.</p><P>None
of them understood why she had said that. None of them had ever done
anything to anger a kitsune. They'd never seen a kitsune since the
attack by Kyuubi, and when they went to the village, and they'd all
been kind and courteous to them there.</p><P>But
the Vixen's bloodthirsty eyes were focused on only one of them.
Naruto.</p><P><B>KKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Orochimaru
was more than bored. He was dissapointed. He had finished casing his
most likely subject for his next body, and all he had found was
dissapointment. Sasuke had gained someone who could teach him far
more than Orochimaru could, and it was obvious that the Sharingan was
out of his reach, yet again. But that was alright, he'd just wait for
the next generation or two. But for now, he needed to find a
replacement.</p><P>So,
here he was, casing the village, looking like a regular joe, one of
the leaf-shinobi, with long black hair and black eyes. His jounin
vest was horribly restricting, and there was no where to put his
beloved purple rope! Ah, well. Sacrifices had to be made to get what
one wants...</p><P>Strangely
enough, the village was acting as if it were a normal day, and not
the beginning of the chuunin exams. He thought the village would be
in an uproar, what with the hokage dead, a new one in office, and the
chuunin-exam chaos. But no.</p><P>Speaking
of Sarutobi, he should stop by, say hello to his old sensei. A smirk
on his face, he headed for the stone. He knew he'd find his teacher's
name on that stone, simply because ALL hokage died in the line of
duty. There wasn't a single one who had ever died of old age.</p><P>He
was surprised, though, to find a lone figure standing in front of the
stone, at this time of day. He thought it might be Hatake Kakashi,
lamenting his lost teammates, but no. This was a younger figure, an
academy student, he was sure. He was short, and he was holding some
sort of helmet in his hands.</p><P>Well,
now? What was the prodigal grandson doing all alone, when there were
snakes about?</p><P>Orochimaru
approached the boy, silent, and hiding his aura. This boy was
interesting. He was obviously brooding. There was little that didn't
point to that right away. His face was dark with unshed tears and
anger. His little body shook with the effort to contain it all.</p><P>If
the golden-eyed snake remembered correctly, Konohamaru had lost his
parents in the Kyuubi attack, and had only had his grandfather, and
his uncle. Now, both were gone... Well, now, this would indeed be
interesting.</p><P>"What
are you doing, Konohamaru-san?" He called, his voice silky
smooth, and enticing.</p><P>Konohamaru
started, his hands immediately going to his weapon, and spiking one
in Orochimaru's direction. Good, the boy atleast had good instincts. 
Orochimaru caught the amateur attempt, and was rewarded with a full
on glare.</p><P>"None
of your business." Konoha's pride answered, petulant and
childish.</p><P>Orochimaru
chuckled darkly. Oh, how he would love nothing more than to break
that childishness of his. He spoke, soft, and sweet, convincing.</p><P>"It's
a tragedy really. They could have prevented it, you know. More
security, and he'd still be alive today."</p><P>Black
eyes shot up to search the deathly pale face, full of hope. Here was
someone who agreed with Konohamaru.</p><P>"And
even worse, they used it to start war propaganda against the Sound
village." Orochimaru tsked, shaking his head.</p><P>Konohamaru
looked confused, as he asked, "What do you mean?"</p><P>"They
knew full well that the enemy assassin was only wearing a genjutsu of
Orochimaru, but they didn't announce it to the public. They insist
that it was in fact the leader of the Sound, one of the three
legendary Sannin." Orochimaru feigned shock, "You didn't
know? I would have thought they would have told the honorable
grandson the details of his death..."</p><P>Konohamaru's
face clouded, hate, anger, and betrayal mixing. "Nothing. They
told me nothing."</p><P>The
snake was excited. He had the boy ensnared now.</p><P>"Well,
I'm here, actually, to take a look into it for my Lord, Orochimaru. 
It's easier to clear his name when I look like one of you guys. Plus,
I have a feeling someone would attack me, should they find out. But
you can keep a secret, can't you?"</p><P>Konohamaru
smiled, nodding. He wasn't trusted with secrets, not by anyone. But,
then again, he didn't really have anyone. After his Jii-chan died,
no one wanted to take care of him. He'd been placed with Kurenai,
simply because she was carrying his cousin.</p><P>"Well,
I can't see why you would want to stay here, not after the deaths of
all your family. I surely wouldn't." Orochimaru continued,
hoping that his skills of manipulation were good enough that this
wouldn't push the boy over the wrong edge.</p><P>Konohamaru
bit his lip, trying hard to keep from crying. He didn't want this
stranger to see his tears. He didn't want anyone to see his tears.
Ninja never shed tears. Never. Academy had drilled that into him, and
though his grandfather had said it was alright to cry sometimes, he
didn't know if this was one of them.</p><P>"To
tell the truth, I'm not too sure if this village deserves talent like
yours. If they can't even protect their hokage, how are they
supposed to protect and nuture pure shinobi talent?" Orochimaru
shook his head for affect. "My village, they put us through the
ringer, but we are trained to our full potential, nothing gets in our
way. My master makes sure of it."</p><P>The
boy turned wide eyes to the elder shinobi. "Really? We always
have to do drills and stuff in class, but there's hardly any
teachers. So, if we make a little mistake, no one notices. It's hard
to get it right. I've practised all night sometimes, but without a
teacher's help, it's hard. What about you guys?"</p><P>Orochimaru
stepped forward, standing right beside the boy now, gazing at the
sky. "Well, usually we're taught by our sempai, with occasional
teachings from Orochimaru-sama. But I have a feeling Orochimaru-sama
would want to teach the grandson of his master very closely. He's
kept an eye on this place, you know."</p><P>"Really?"</p><P>"Yeah,
really."</p><P>"He
would...take me in?" Konohamaru looked down, trying to make a
VERY hard descision. He hated this village, it had taken so many from
him, but...He loved his grandpa, and he'd protected this village, up
until his dying day.</p><P>"Absolutely.
 He has a soft-spot for children, you see.(Yeah, I'll say! -Otaku)
Takes in just about every orphan he sees, if they have talent. You
do, a lot of it, so he'll be especially interested in you." 
Orochimaru said, grinning. "And, if there was any place you
could go to earn power, to gain it, for whatever goal you may have,
then he is the one to teach you. He has ways of unlocking power
within someone, brilliant ways, that tend to stick with you." 
Inside, he knew that this boy was his. Now, this child would go with
him, and he'd become the perfect testament to his rule over Sarutobi!</p><P>"What
do I have left here?" Konohamaru asked himself, almost so
quietly, Orochimaru didn't hear him. But the snake-sannin did, and
smirked to himself, knowing he had won, his teacher's legacy, his
only kin, would die out, and become his body, and Sarutobi would fall
off the face of the planet.</p><P>"Nothing.
This village has taken everything. Ruined everything. I...I can't
stay here. Shinobi-san, will you...Can I go to your village with
you?" Konohamaru asked.</p><P>Orochimaru
grinned. He had won, and it felt good to win.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>The
fox's form shifted, growing smaller, but ever more menacing. Soon,
she was a red-headed woman, clothed in a very short crimson kimono,
her beautiful face twisted in fury beyond recognition. She growled,
just as menacing and threatening as her fox-form has.</p><P>Naruto
shivvered, not sure if it was from the rising cold of the forest,
with night approaching, or if it was fear of this demon. Suddenly,
she was in front of him, the world turned, and his cheek burned, as
if struck with acid.</p><P>"How
dare you, you bitch!" She hissed, her voice sounding as if all
the bowels of hell flew from her lips. "How dare you...I'm
going to take everything from you. EVERYTHING. And then, I am going
to laugh, as you die, choking on your own blood, and that of your
lord."</p><P>Sasuke
had seen enough, obviously she had some kind of grudge against
Naruto. At this point, she was ignoring everyone else, so it was a
good time to attack.</p><P>Tohru
apperantly beleived the same thing, for as his prince was about to
spring to an attack, Tohru beat him to it, Hidari leaping off his
shoulder and into the brush. Rushing forward, swinging a huge
shuriken towards the wench, he made her jump back, driving her away
from his prince. Tohru stood protectively in front of Naruto, who
was slowly regaining his senses back.</p><P>Tsumi
growled, her claws growing to bat the offending weapon away like a
stick, while she dived for the human boy's throat, ready to tear it
out to get to the blonde. Tohru dodged, shifting backwards to throw
said blonde out of the way, keeping in front of the bitch. Her
rending claws tore through his clothes, but his dodging managed to
keep them out of his flesh, for now.</p><P>Lobbing
the windmill shuriken in her direction, to distract her, he pulled a
few explosive tagged-kunai from his weapons pouch, and with more
accuracy, sent them flying towards the fox-demon. She spied them,
just as she tossed aside the giant weapon, and had no time to dodge.
They hit her center chest and exploded.</p><P>Tohru
stopped running, trying to gain his breath, as the cloud of bark and
dirt took it's time settling. Naruto called out, trying to warn him,
trying to tell him that a demon wouldn't be harmed by such a small
attack.</p><P>But
it was too late. She moved so fast that the dust clung to her body in
a slipstream as she crossed the measly few metres between her and the
sickly shinobi. His turquiose eyes widened in disbeleif, as he saw
her arm dissapear up to her elbow in his stomach.</p><P>"TOHRU!!"
Naruto screamed, as time seemed to flow slowly around them. Tsumi
grinned, white fangs flashing in the sparce sunlight, as Shino burst
through the bushes to the side. Hidari had come to warn him, to let
him know that his master was in a war he could not win. And so,
dragging Hinata and Kiba with him, Shino had come to help. He was
utterly surprised by the amount of blood that splattered on him, as
the demon-wench removed her hand.</p><P>Tohru
began to fall, blood coming from his throat, as his eyes widened in
pain. He wasn't sure what was going on, why was he in so much pain?
Why was the world turning on it's side? And why was Hidari calling
him, screaming for him, just like Naruto? Why was everything
beggining to fade?</p><P>Sasuke
rushed to Tohru's side, dodging the woman's claws, as he scooped up
Tohru's body. Naruto joined the fray now, his shadow clones jumping
into the melee as quickly as they could, trying to hold Tsumi down.</p><P>"WHY?!"
Naruto roared, Kyuubi's chakra pulsing through him in his anger. He
waited, as the bitch snarled and laughed.</p><P>"You
ask why, you miserable bitch?! You dare to ask me what you did to
deserve this, you backstabbing, pup-stealer?!" She snarled, her
demonic nature tinging her voice with a deep, resonating anger. 
Naruto recoiled, shocked at the accusations she leveled on him.</p><P>His
eyes flicked to where Sasuke and Shino were both trying to do what
they could for Tohru, to keep him alive. They needed more time. Kiba
was growling, deep, and the only thing that kept him from attacking
was Hinata's arms around his neck, holding him back. They would die,
if he attacked now.</p><P>"What
pup? What are you talking about?!" Naruto bellowed, unsure
himself, but needing more time as well.</p><P>"My
darling, my baby, you stole him from me, the same day you stole my
third tail!" Now, her struggling got feircer as the hatred and
anger of a mother parted too soon from her child burned within her. 
She sliced through three of the clones, before five more took their
place.</p><P>"Tsubasa..."
The whisper passed across his lips, as his blue eyes widened in
realisation. This was the corpse he had rescued Tsubasa from! This
was the mother Tsubasa had cried for nine whole days for!</p><P>"B-but
I didn't steal him!" He cried, trying to desperately explain
what happened, why he did what he did. But she wriggled harder,
breaking free from his hold. She growled demonically at him, as she
readied her claws for a final strike.</p><P>"Yes,
you did, you evil little bitch." She hissed, "You stole my
kit from me, and now, I will steal all you hold dear from YOU!"
She said, launching herself at him.</p><P>Naruto
froze. What should he do? She was right...He'd stolen Tsubasa from
her, no matter how well intentioned he might be. He...He was wrong,
and evil, to seperate a child from it's mother, while they both still
lived! His body wouldn't move, as if these thoughts weighed it down.</p><P>Suddenly,
a flash of his own child ran through him. His Yoh, his baby. The kit
he had to care for and love, and protect! He couldn't leave him all
alone in the world...He couldn't!</p><P>Now,
his body was able to move, but he didn't need to. While he was
distracted Kiba and Sasuke had both slipped into defensive positions
in front of him, causing Tsumi to drop out of her attack last minute.
 Growling in the three boy's faces, she sneered.</p><P>"This
isn't over, boy. Not by a long shot. Prepare to see all you love
destroyed." The last whispered feircely, she sprung away,
dissapearing into the dark, leafy forest.</p><P><B>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</B></p><P>Tohru
hurt, everywhere, his breathing heavy and panting. Shino knew this.
What was even worse, was that he hadn't realised that this was the
person he'd been corresponding with for months, until Hidari had come
to get him. How could he not have recognised the ingenious little
bluenette? He'd always been smart, they'd known that from Academy.
But no one really paid attention to him, he'd been dying...</p><P>Dying,
right. That's what he was doing now, his life's blood spilling out of
his body so quickly it wasn't even funny. Tohru's body shivvered,
jerked, his blue eyes starting to open, as a low, pained moan escaped
him. He was surprised to find that the first site that welcomed him,
Shino, comforted him. It was painful to breath, even more so to talk.</p><P>"Water..."
Tohru gasped, coughed. Where were his princes? Were they safe? He had
to get some of the Water in him to speed his healing. He couldn't
leave them alone in this leafy dungeon. "Water!" He
gasped, a little more forceful as the effort surged pain through his
ribcage, or what was left of it.</p><P>Hidari
flew down from his perch on Shino's head and pointed to the flask
containing the Water of Life. He didn't speak, but Shino knew it must
be important, if Hidari did anything at all. He took up the supply
of water, surprised at how little there was. Lifting Tohru's head,
supporting his shaking shoulders on his own hips, Shino put the flask
to the bluenette's mouth, forcing the water into Tohru's gasping
throat.</p><P>Naruto
watched this sweet scene, as Tohru choked down the Water, which, as
soon as it touched his lips, began to heal him. His flesh, bones and
various innards began to heal, right before him. But not in a cloud
of steam, as his always did. This was gentle, crawling back. But it
still looked like it hurt like hell...</p><P>Shino
jumped a bit, as Tohru hacked up some dark blood from his healing
lungs. After that, he began to breath a little easier, and eased back
into Shino's strong arms. This caused the bug-users eyes to get
really big underneath his dark glasses, and had the situation not
been so dire, Naruto might have laughed.</p><P>Sasuke
didn't find it so funny What had Naruto done to deserve that kind of
wrath from a woman he obviously didn't know. It had to do with
Tsubasa, he knew that much, but was it possibly something Kyuubi had
done too?</p><P>Speaking
of his red-headed mate, what was the man hiding? He'd mentioned the
Uchiha clan when they entered the city, saying something about them
having to do with the Kyuubi-tragedy, but still. Kyuubi had yet to
explain, and Sasuke was starting to get anxious. All in all, this was
a VERY bad time for him to be thinking all of this over. His left
hand, the one holding his tome, twitched irritably, at the thoughts
swirling around in his head.</p><P>Naruto
was worse, though. His thoughts were bordering on the neurotic. How
could he think he was such a good person, such a kind person, when
he'd torn this woman's child from her injured arms?! It didn't matter
if he had thought she was dying. He really was a monster. They were
right...</p><P>His
mind dropped into loops, hearing those words again and again, as
those men raped him. He listened to every word again, and damn, if
they weren't right! A broken, hurt smile crossed his face, his eyes
wild. They had been right all along. He belonged here, in this town
of broken children and raging monsters. He never should have left.</p><P>A
spike of panic filled him, not his own though. Then he realised that
though he couldn't hear Kyuubi, the fox was still there. He put a
clamp on his thoughts. Kyuubi couldn't hear that. He'd want to hurt
Tsumi. He couldn't allow that, not after all she'd already been
through. He would bide his time, and then give her what she wanted.
Yoh had two capable fathers to take care of him, he would never be
lonely, not as the prince of the kitsune.</p><P>Naruto's
mask slid back into place, and something within him broke, for the
final time.</p><P>End

Okay, I've been getting a lot of really good reviews, but most of

know, and I didn't fix it because I'm really lazy, ok? I know that
the Hyuuga clan Kekkei Genkai (Bloodline Limit) is the Byakugan,
okay? I had Sasuke on the mind, and I was worried over whether I was
writing him right. So my fingers slipped typing, and I didn't catch

<br><br><h3>Chapter 19</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
Long time no see! Otaku here, with a new installment in the Kits!
Saga! (OMFG, I sound like the announcer from DBZ. Someone shoot me!)
Anyway, I know it's been long in coming, and I'm SO sorry. I got
stuck on my other store, Run Away, and I always switch off, write one
chapter of that and one chapter of this. So this got kicked to the
sidelines...I humbly offer my life as payment...bows dramatically
okay, not really, but you get the point.</P><P>Kits!</P><P>Pairings:
Sheesh...Pay attention, will ya? Anyway, you already know them, if
you're this far in.</P><P>Warnings:
Um...Lotsa blood and guts, feeble attempts at fight scenes, and quite
a few mental breakdowns.</P><P>Description:
Into the Second exam already, Naru-chan and friends are down one
companion already, and they STILL don't have a scroll! What are the
gonna do? And what's this? Neji is learning from Gaara's example?!</P><P>Disclaimer:
If I owned Naruto, Raiga and Ranmaru would be alive, as a testament
to the face that the seven swordsmen of the mist collect pretty boys.
So, HAH!!</P><P>Kits!
Chapter 19</P><P>Gaara
was bored. VERY bored. And Shukaku's suggestion of playing Shiritori
was not helping. This test was annoying, especially when one was a
sleep-deprived, angsty, teenage psychopath, with a comparibly more
psychotic tanuki-badger trying to coax you into playing a word game
inside one's own head. It just didn't work, and that made Gaara even
more frustrated.</P><P>Plus,
there were BUGS.</P><P>Gaara
was not happy.</P><P>Temari
knew this, and so, as leader-de-facto, she was leading them towards
an enemy. Hopefully slaughtering some gennin might settle Gaara down
a little. They needed him calm and collected, not psychotic and
spouting more of that 'I only love myself' crap!</P><P>It
was simple, ambush a group of rain nin that was, at this point,
attempting to plan an ambush on them, and then let Gaara take care of
them, and hopefully, get a scroll. Temari prided herself on her
genius tactical skills, and this just proved it.</P><P>However,
she hadn't noticed the group of Konoha genin hiding in the bushes
just a few feet away. She was too busy worrying over what Gaara would
do to her and Kankuro, if she didn't get him prey soon. It was
strange that she sought out other prey, since these would have been
such an easy target.</P><P>Only
one of them was awake, and he didn't have to move to watch them. Neji
Hyuuga had his Byakugan active, and was throroughly engrossed in the
movement of all living things in the forest. To the rest of the
world, it would look like he was sleeping, just like his teammates,
but he wasn't. Inside his eyelids, his eyes saw all.</P><P>And
there was definately something strange going on. Lately, he'd
felt...Stifled. And not just caged, like he'd always felt, but...This
was different. It was cruel, almost. Every so often his heart would
feel as if someone had reached inside and started squeazing it, and
it would become hard to breath. He felt like crying when it happened,
but he couldn't, surely it was all in his head, nothing to worry
about. His chakra were perfect, and therefore, he was perfectly
healthy. Nothing was wrong with him.</P><P>But
he felt trapped all the time. And it wasn't just the Curse of the
Caged Bird, either. It was...everything. As if life, in some way,
was holding him down. It was even worse, because lately Lee had
taken a strange interest in him, always walking beside him, always
talking to him, never giving him a moments peace. And always, always
asking him if he was alright.</P><P>He
couldn't stand it. It hurt, to have someone worry about him so much.
It was his job to protect, not to be protected. Why couldn't Lee
understand that? So long as Hinata-sama was alive, he was doomed.</P><P>A
sudden stillness in the clearing a few trees over pulled at his
senses. He focused his Byakugan there, and was amazed to see a smile
come to Gaara's face. Not really a smile, more like an insane grin,
but still. Gaara looked happy. Something Neji hadn't felt in a very
long time.</P><P>Why
was he happy? What did he have to be happy about? His chakra were
some of the most damaged Neji had ever seen, aside from Naruto, back
in the academy. Actually, they were about the same...Anyway, what
could he possibly have to be happy about?</P><P>Oh...That
was why...Was the color of the blood that splattered the trees really
that pretty? Did he find happiness in it? Or...freedom? Could Gaara
possibly find freedom in the slaughter of the rain nin that had tried
to ambush them? It was cruel, a massacre, and most of it cleaned up
by sand after the initial blooming of the blood.</P><P>But
Neji had to admit, it was strangely beautiful, and even more so,
it...it lightened his heart. It made him feel...free. Would the
feeling get better, if he was the one slaughtering? Was that why
Gaara was so happy?</P><P>It
was a thing to think on, and a smile, an almost exact mirror of the
one Gaara had worn previously, crossed the Hyuuga's lips.</P><P>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</P><P>Tohru
was still hurt. In fact, he was still so hurt, he was pretty sure he
was holding back his princes. The water had done a wonderful job of
healing him, but he hadn't had enough to properly get rid of all the
wounds. The one to his stomach was still tender, and could reopen at
any point in time, if he moved to quickly.</P><P>"We
should take him to the gate! They can get him a doctor! Wasn't
Tsunade-Baa-sama a doctor? She could help him!" Naruto's
argument was punctuated with wild gestures, the boy obviously upset. Tohru would be too. Ever since Shino and his teammates had left,
assured they would survive, Tohru had been just a little depressed.
It was strange, but the bug-weilder reminded him a lot of Hidari. The little Fae had gone with him, leaving Aurora to coo over her
Master.</P><P>"We
can't afford to take that time, Naruto, and you know that! If we get
him to the tower, they should help him. We can always do some first
aid there, I'm sure there'll be supplies. But first, we have to get
another scroll. We can't do anything, until we've got it." Sasuke was right. Tohru admited it. He was holding them back.</P><P>"Do
it. Please, Naruto-sama. Don't let me hold you back." Tohru
said, coughing in the end, on some left over blood coating his lungs.
"I'll be fine, for a while."</P><P>Naruto
didn't look happy about it. Not at all. He sulked the entire time
they were setting up the traps. He sulked long into the night, in
fact, as they waited for some morons to take the bait. Turns out
though, that frustration turned to good use when it came down to the
fight.</P><P>Naruto's
shadow clones were ferocious in taking them down, so much so that
when one tried to stumble away from them, the only thing it took to
finish him off was a good solid whack on the head with Sasuke's book.</P><P>"All
done working that out of your system now, Dobe?" Sasuke
queried, one dark eyebrow raised.</P><P>All
he got in reply was a glare. Naruto was shaken. He hadn't known he
was capable of such cruelty. He'd literally ripped one of the
gennin's arms off. What was wrong with him?! Could he not stop his
evil, even by sheer will?! His face clouded, a firm frown darkening
his sky-blue eyes.</P><P>Tohru
limped over to the bloodied, broken nin, and dug through their
supplies, eventually finding their scroll.</P><P>"Yatta!
What luck! It's a heaven scroll." Tohru grinned, his green eyes
lighting up. Hopefully the news would brighten his princes' moods.</P><P>Sasuke
nodded, "Let's get going then. The sooner we get to the tower,
the sooner we get medics."</P><P>KITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITSKITS</P><P>Tenten
was scared. So scared she was shaking. This wasn't right...Where was
their gentle Neji, who only struck chakra points to disable, not to
torture! Where was the dark-maned boy she had thought of as an elder
brother...</P><P>This
demon wasn't her friend! Her mind reeled against the carnage, as
Neji ripped through them, using his 'gentle' fist technique to shred
vital organs, to rip through muscles in the most painful way. He was
even fending off Lee! Not injuring him, which showed some peice of
his mind, but still, carrying on with such ferocity.</P><P>And
the smile. It was as if his eyes were vacant, but the sadistic grin
on his face showed every bit of pleasure he got from it. When the
last one died, his death-scream gurgling in his throat, a great sigh
escaped Neji's lips, and a look of contentment washed over him,
completely at odds with the splatters of blood on his cheeks, and the
stain of scarlet on his white shirt.</P><P>Tenten
was crying now, and Lee looked lost, and scared.</P><P>'Oh,
Gai-sensei. What could possibly be wrong? Why is Neji acting this
way?!' Lee thought, but didn't dare move against his teammate. He
knew for a fact, that the little shreds of their enemies could easily
have been him as well.</P><P>Tenten
flinched, as the last body hit the ground, with a sickening wet
'Thud', and her shaking turned into tremors. She worked so hard to
dampen her chakra, because she felt like a rabbit in the range of a
true predator, one that had just finished killing, and would have no
problem turning to her and slaughtering her if she drew his
attention.</P><P>It
started so low, Lee and Tenten flinched again, unsure what it was,
but they realised, as it continued, and got louder. Neji was
giggling. Somehow, that scared them even further. Neji Hyuuga didn't
giggle, he was too...stoic. But here he was, giggling, and it was
turning into full on laugh. Then, it went from a laugh to a roar of
laughter, as tears slid down the brunette's face, whether from his
emotions or from the hilarity of whatever it was he saw. Tenten
started crying as well, as she realised that that wasn't 'haha' funny
laughter.</P><P>It
was hysterical.</P><P>End
Chapter</P><P>Otaku:
Hey! This one took less time!</P><P>Neji:
So, are you moving on to me now?</P><P>Otaku:
Wha-huh?</P><P>Neji:
Am I your next target on the emo-scale.</P><P>Otaku:
-Eyes him- Hunny, you were emo long before I got here.</P><P>Lee:
-nods in agreement.-</P><P>See

<br><br><h3>Chapter 20</h3><hr><br><P>(A/N)
YO!! Long time no see! Wow, its been what, four months? Aheh, sorry
it took so long. I just had a lot going on, y'know? Ah well, heres
the next chapter of kits!</P><P><B>Kits!</B></P><P>Pairings:
Wow, you really don't pay attention, huh?</P><P>Warnings:
Nothing really warning worthy in this chapter, sadly...I'm losing my
touch! T.T</P><P>Description:
To the tower we GO!! And finally we make it! What? What does the
scroll do?!</P><P>Disclaimer:
I don't own Naruto, and you know it!</P><P><B>Kits!
Chapter 20 - </B><I>Yarn
Entangled</I></P><P>The
kitsune team made it, one teen bleeding half to death, and the others
rather tired, but in one peice. They were a mess, really, and
horribly vulnerable, but they had survived the psychotic test, and
hopefully were that much closer to becoming Chunin.</P><P>The
door creaked open heavily under Sasuke's hands, pushed open to reveal
a rather large room, much like the one they used to spar in in
Iruka-sensei's classes. Naruto grunted, adjusting Tohru a little
better against him, the green-haired nin's arm slung over his
shoulders. Tohru bit back a groan as the adjustment shifted the
tender, newly grown organs in his belly.</P><P>"Come
on, get inside." Sasuke ushered them inside, away from other
potential threats. Turns out, the worst threats were already inside. Black eyes darted around, assessing the situation. Four other teams
had made it first, and all of them looked killer.</P><P>One
team from Sand, who's members, except for one, were taking turns
sleeping. Another from Sound, who seemed to be passing manga back
and forth between each other, in a small circle. Two groups from
Leaf, both of which worried Sasuke exceedingly.</P><P>One
of the Leaf teams held Rock Lee, and Neji, both of which were
formidable opponents. And that look on Neji's face reminded him far
too much of Itachi to leave him feeling comfortable.</P><P>The
other, included Sakura. She was stronger now, and more filled out.
Quite the woman, but Sasuke had little interest in her. It was her
teammate, who looked surprisingly like himself, with a different
haircut, of course, that held his attention. Dark, assasin's eyes,
and an emotionless smile that seemed almost violent. He had few
weapons on him other than the standard kunai and shuriken packs all
shinobi carry. He seemed to be sketching something. What, Sasuke
couldn't say.</P><P>He
guided Naruto and their injured gaurd into the center, where he'd be
able to watch all four teams. It didn't really surprise him that
Sakura came over, the pretense of helping written all over her. Sasuke watched her movements, and made note of some new form of
training.</P><P>"Sasuke-kun!
I'm so releived to see you made it alright. Do you have any wounds
you need treated?" She cooed, that same simpering voice she had
used back in academy dripping from her words. It nearly made the
raven want to gag.</P><P>"Two
things, Haruno-san. One, I have a teammate who's bleeding to death in
front of you, so maybe asking about him first, would get you a few
points, and two," Here, he used his right ring finger, Naruto's
ring glinting on the digit, to pull the collar of his kimono open to
expose Kyuubi's mark, "I'm married now. So, back off, unless
you're actually more interested in helping us, then with flirting
with me."</P><P>For
a moment, rage flashed across her face, before it was replaced with a
nervous simulation of concern. She turned to the injured Tohru. His
green eyes, even hazed with pain as they were, caught the look of
hatred she hid beneath her bangs. He shivvered as the feel of
demon-poisoned aura reached out to him.</P><P>"Haruno-chan!"
Another called out. It was her dark-haired teammate, "Let's
leave them be. After all, they seem quite...adaquate, getting here."</P><P>Naruto
prickled. That had to be an insult, he just wasn't sure how to react
to it. He glared at the smiling male, an uncertain knowing making
itself known inside his head. He recognised those smiles, the ones
he was giving right now. They reminded him of the ones he practiced
in the mirror every day. The ones that made sure Sasuke and Kyuubi
thought he was getting better, thought he was becoming okay.</P><P>"Sasuke,
maybe we should open the scrolls? They might be medical supplies, or
they might at least alert the examiners that they can send help now."
Naruto suggested, just to get the pink-haired bitch away from his
man.</P><P>Sasuke
hesitated. He didn't really think that opening them would help Tohru,
but it couldn't really hurt, could it? He was already just this side
of dying. Sighing, he nodded consent.</P><P>The
blonde nodded back, and stepped a few feet away from his teammates,
just in case. He didn't want them to get caught up in whatever was
going to be summoned, especially if it was some form of final twist
on the test. Examiners could be very cruel.</P><P>Holding
each one, he snagged his fingers under the seals, and tossed them
away from his body, holding one end, so that they unfurled across
each other. Blue eyes and black barely caught sight of the summon
spell before it took affect, a puff of smoke covering a ten-foot
radius, heralding the arrival of...</P><P>Something.</P><P>They
waited anxiously, Tohru's hold on conciousness slipping with every
second, as the smoke cleared. Green eyes widened, even as the
hyper-active blonde shinobi launched onto the summoned creature.</P><P>Iruka
laughed, as he was tackled by Naruto, the first such hug he'd had in
a full year. Tears welled up in his eyes, but he didn't allow them to
fall. A shinobi did not cry, even when being reunited with long lost
adopted sons. He did however, swing the child around, hugging him
closely.</P><P>"Iruka-sensei!
I missed you so much! I'm so glad to see you, please stay for a
while, I don't want to have to track you down later! Oh, and Sasuke's
here too, and we brought Tohru with us, and Yoh, and Kyuu-chan, and
all the others, and you just have to meet them, and please don't be
mad at me, I know I ran away, but I had no choice, I couldn't stay,
they'd have killed me and Yoh, before he was even born! Iruka-sensei,
why are you crying?!"</P><P>Turns
out Shinobi do cry, especially when all their worries seemed to melt
away. Iruka sobbed, still clinging to his brilliant, beautiful,
blonde student. All the worry, all the heartache he'd gone through
while Naruto was missing seemed to evaporate in the bliss of hugging
the poor kitsune-carrier once again. He couldn't even scold Naruto
for run on sentances and babbling, he was crying, and laughing, and
smiling so much.</P><P>Sasuke
watched this reunion with a small, happy smile. Naruto had missed the
brunette male, the closest thing he had to a parent. He felt
absolute joy for his blonde mate, even as the blue-eyed male fussed
over his sniffling teacher. It was a beautiful sight to see them
reunited.</P><P>Gaara,
entrigued by this display of emotion from the brunette he'd come to
cherish himself, watched. A slight twinge in his heart heralded the
emotion Shukaku had once, long ago, named jealousy. He would have
pouted, but Gaara of the Sand does not outwardly pout. He'd just
have to stake his claim later.</P><P>Naruto
was still fussing over Iruka, even as the elder male waved off his
concern, smiling a smile of parental joy. He forced the blonde to
hold still for a moment.</P><P>"Hush,
Naruto, I have to tell you something important." This got the
boy to still. "The next test isn't for another month. It's going
to be a massive tournament, in front of the visiting kages, and all
of Konoha. However, in a few hours, at the end of the second test,
there will be preliminaries, to see who will fight in the big
tourney. You understand?"</P><P>RUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAY</P><P>Kyuubi
stetched out on the bed, his arms straight out in front of him.
Zabuza rolled his eyes in annoyance, knowing what came next. Ever
since Kyuubi had come back to the hotel, and Haku had taken Yoh out
for a stroll, and maybe a nice play in the park, along with Tsubasa,
it had become a few-minutes-long cycle.</P><P>"I'm
boooooooooooooooooooooooo-ooooorrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeed!"
Kyuubi would whine, before rolling over onto his back. He'd stare at
the ceiling for a few minutes, before heaving a giant sigh. Then,
he'd roll over on his belly, and lament his boredom once again.</P><P>Zabuza
said nothing, but silently prayed to all the gods in existance that
Haku would hurry the fuck up. He didn't think he could deal with
such an annoying boss without his little kunai to temper
his...well...temper.</P><P>Kyuubi
turned a slightly dissapointed look towards his bandage-mouthed
gaurd. With a huff, he sat up, posture suggestive of a five year old
child.</P><P>"When
I say I'm bored, that means you entertain me." Kyuubi
deadpanned, "Wow, you're really bad at your job, Zabu-kun."</P><P>Zabuza
raised an eyebrow. Y'know, if Kyuubi wanted to be entertained, fine. He carefully leaned his sword against the wall, and proceeded, very
carefully, to dance a small, jerky jig. (Think Aang's funny dance,
the one where he slaps his knees? Yeah, that one.-Otaku)</P><P>Kyuubi
couldn't stop staring. It was like...watching a monkey dance. You
know you should really look away, but you just can't...It's something
that has rarely ever been seen. He felt almost like he was
trespassing.</P><P>Zabuza's
dance was completed, and seeing as Kyuubi was too dumbfounded to
complain of boredom anymore, he picked up his sword, and went right
back to leaning.</P><P>RUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAYRUNAWAY</P><P>Temari
was worried. Not that that wasn't a normal state for her, it was just
rather annoying. The blonde contender, obviously atleast part demon,
to have come in with that demonic procession, was holding on to their
guide, as if they knew him. Were they being led astray by Konoha? Did
their leafy-counterparts consider them a threat enough to team up
with demons to get rid of them?</P><P>Then
there was Gaara. He kept making her nervous, staring hungrily at the
group, as if he wanted to rip them to shreds, and then eat the
peices. Or maybe he just wanted to eat them. He was getting to that
age. Did jinchuriiki even go through puberty?</P><P>Kankuro
watched as his sister's face morphed into one of horrified
curiousity, while staring at his little brother. He did NOT want to
know what was going through her mind. Especially when she started
gagging over there in the corner. Huh...They didn't have any milk
today...</P><P>Gaara,
meanwhile, was concentrating on watching the interaction between the
group. Naruto was greeting Iruka like one would a beloved parent. And
Iruka was returning the sentiment. He frowned, realising that no one
had ever greeted him like that. Except his uncle. But Yashamaru was
a backstabbing bastard.</P><P>When
the red-heads thoughts turned to his uncle, he bit his lip, a strange
prickling sensation coming to his eyes. The phantom weight of
Shukaku's arms around his shoulders made the sudden ache in his chest
abide a bit. His green eyes twinkled with unshed tears, and sadly,
no one but Shukaku cared enough to look.</P><P>Sasuke's
eyes strayed towards the red head just in time to catch his perturbed
look towards them. This put him into an alerted mood immediately,
simply because...well, this was Gaara. That perturbed look spelled
their doom. Or worse. He shivvered in rememberence of his experience
at the ramen shop. He was thoroughly suprised that Gaara was that
good with his mouth.</P><P>Shaking
away those thoughts, he turned back to Tohru, who had just coughed up
another large ball of blood-soaked mucus from his 'healing' lungs. He knelt down beside the injured nin, a worried frown covering his
pale features.</P><P>"Are
you going to be okay with just that water, Tohru?" Sasuke
murmered, knowing his green-eyed teammate would hear, but his blonde
was too preoccupied to pay attention.</P><P>"Yeah.
I'll b-" Another tremendously painful wracking cough, and Tohru
grimaced, his whole body tingling with the torturous breath. He
weakly opened his water skin, taking another deep draught from his
healing water. Feeling the soothing affect, he let out a sigh of
eased breath.</P><P>"I'll
be fine, Prince."</P><P>Sasuke
wasn't satisfied with this, but had to make do. It was about then,
that the doors slammed open again. Apperantly, teams had been
arriving during the drama with Iruka, and had been conducting their
own scroll-openings. Now, there was a large crowd of teachers and
students to watch, as Tsunade-hime, the fifth Hokage, made her
entrance.</P><P>Her
eyes scanned over the crowd, seeing that only four of the leaf teams
made it, along with the kitsune and sand teams, respectively. Adding
the sand team, that made a total of seven teams. She frowned. Too
many. There were still too many to show off.</P><P>"Listen
up!" She announced, hands balling on her hips, as she forced
herself to sound authoratative.</P><P>"There
are officially too many of you to take the final test. So, instead
of giving you a full month off, to polish your skills and rest for
the final test, we're going to hold preliminary rounds. Right here,
right NOW."</P><P>End
Chapter</P><P>Otaku:
Oh hell! That was fun! I wrote this in three days, after I got over
my writers block! YAY!!</P><P>Sasuke:

You're running to the end of what you have planned, baka.</P><P>Otaku:

<br><br><h3>Chapter 21</h3><hr><br><P><B>Author's Note</B>: Yup. It's
been a year. ^.^ Sorry. I haven't really been myself this last
year, and I kinda lost the train of this fic. XD So, please, for the
love of god, don't feel bad if this chapter feels a little off. 
I'm using it to get into the flow of the story again.</P><P><B>Kits!</B></P><P><B>Pairings: </B>
SasuNaruKyuuShukaGaa, Along with KakaIru (Broke up, only temporarily.
^.^ Don't worry.), SakuKanku (Or I might kill her off… .
Not sure yet.) , Tohru(oc)Shino, and various others.</P><P><B>Warnings:</B></P><P><B>Description: </B>The prelims
begin! Sakura and Ino face off, and Koku faces off against Shino.
After that, we get to see Tenten and Temari fight it out! It's
gonna be good guys!</P><P><B>Disclaimer:</B> Trust me, if I
owned Naruto, I wouldn't be considering moving back in with my
mother. T.T</P><P><B>Kits! Chapter 21 – </B>I lie
inside myself for hours…</P><P>Tsunade watched the murmurs of
ascension pass through the crowd of gathered teens, and watched the
shock ring on their faces. She let that settle for a few moments,
before smirking. She turned, facing a jounin no one knew, someone
with long brown hair, and a few scars along his cheeks.</P><P>"Fuka here will explain
everything." She smirked, stepping back as the jounin stepped
forward, his steps echoing in the suddenly quiet arena. He looked
around himself, as if checking each face.</P><P>"The matches will be one on one.
If you lose, you're out. Simple as that, and you can try again next
year." He smirked, "Got it?" He smirked.</P><P>There were nods, and murmurs, and
for a moment, Naruto wondered what would happen if someone was
killed. He was answered rather quickly.</P><P>"Winners are welcome to stay after
their matches and watch their possible opponents. Those that are
injured, after their match, will head to the hospital. Whether they
want to, or not." He was harsh, his voice deep, but he smirked,
showing them he meant it.</P><P>Tohru sighed. Well, looked like he'd
be in the hospital sooner rather than later. He looked around, seeing
a few others wince at the news too. He took careful note, in case he
had to fight any of them. They seemed tough cookies… but… He
smirked, because he'd learned a few things in the demon kingdom.</P><P>Fuka went on to explain that the
matches would be chosen by random lottery, and that those who'd
survived the forest had already been inputted into a computer. That
computer was working out the possible matches now, and was getting
ready to kick out the first match.</P><P>"In the meantime, get your skinny
asses up to the balconies!" He cried, shooing them. "Come down
only when your name is called, got that?!" They all mumbled a 'yes,
sir' but only because no one was sure what else to say. Sasuke was
surprised. It was hard to command the respect of various types of
kids.</P><P>The ravenette watched his blonde
mate, just wanting to be sure he was okay. Those blue eyes were
riveted, dully, upon the screen, waiting for a match to come up.
There seemed no end to the confusion and sorrow in those eyes. Sasuke
wished he could take away that pain, that sorrow, but Naruto seemed
lost in it, and they were in the middle of a war, for lack of better
term.</P><P>Everyone's heads turned up in
surprise as names shifted through the screen finally settling on:</P><P><B>Ino Yamanaka Vs. Sakura Haruno</B></P><P>Sakura frowned, hating the idea of
going up against someone so weak. She growled, jumping down into the
arena, her dress fluttering around her hips, and her fishnets keeping
everything out of view. She smirked, "Come on, Ino-pig."</P><P>The blonde growled herself,
smirking. "I'm gonna take you down, Cherry blossom Widow." She
hissed, taking her sweet time to get downstairs. It was really only
to fuck with the other girl, though. But Sakura seemed cool as a
cucumber. Snorting, she smirked, "Took you long enough, Bitch."</P><P>Ino snarled at the insult, launching
a barrage of shuriken that Sakura only dodged gracefully. She looked
as if she were dancing. It was only after Ino growled, launching
forward in a short taijutsu match, that Sakura knocked her away.
Smirking, the girl leaned down, snatching Ino's long blonde hair,
and tugging, so that the blonde ended up on her knees.</P><P>"Admit defeat, Ino." The
pinkette demanded, pulling up the woman's head, and sliding a kunai
against her throat. "Or I'll really hurt you."</P><P>Ino growled, kicking the green-eyed
girl's feet out from underneath her, and smirked, pinning her. This
was quickly devolving into very little but a catfight. Naruto
grinned, showing some liveliness, "GO SAKURA-CHAN!!!" He called,
unable for forget his old crush, even if he was mated now. Hey, he
could at least cheer her on, couldn't he?</P><P>Sakura hissed, her nails cutting
into the girl atop her's flesh, "Fuck off, Ino…" She purred,
her paralytic poison taking affect, and quickly making Ino fall over.
As an added insult, the girl smirked, leaning over her fallen foe,
and slicing off all of that lusciously long blonde hair. "Now…
Feel free to live your life in fear, ugly bitch." She purred.</P><P>"Winner, Sakura!" Fuka
announced. "Now, get the hell off my stage. Medics!" He cried.
The medics moved forward, grabbing up Ino and carting her off. Fuka
moved in front of everyone. "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, next
match!"</P><P>Again everyone turned their eyes
desperately to the screen, some hoping to be shown, others praying
they weren't. Gaara sighed, closing his eyes, and retreating into
himself, curling up in Shukaku's arms. Ugh… They were lucky he
hadn't snapped already and started murdering everyone. He was this
close. The only reason he didn't want to was because Iruka was
there… And somehow… he didn't want Iruka to see him kill.</P><P>It seemed wrong somehow. And it
seemed like it would turn Iruka towards the blonde quicker. And he
didn't like that outcome. He didn't like it at all. It would be
unforgivable.</P><P>The screen finally showed it's
concensus, declaring:</P><P><B>Zaku of the Sound Vs. Shino
Aburame</B></P><P>Tohru immediately perked up, which
caught the attention of Naruto, who giggled, and gently nudged the
injured nin. "Do you know him, Tohru?" He asked, and was
surprised to be rewarded with a blush and a turned up nose.</P><P>"No… No I don't." he
muttered, but his green eyes glittered as he watched Shino move down.
He'd been so curious about the bug nin. After all… Well, they'd
been writing back and forth via Hidari and Aurora for a long time.
So, he wanted to know more! He was just… curious! That was all.</P><P>Shino stepped into the ring standing
across from his opponent. He frowned behind his color, surprised to
see the boy he'd be fighting had both arms in a sling. Finding
himself slightly angry, he decided to give the poor bastard a choice.</P><P>"Fight me… and you won't live
to recover. Forfeit now, and get treatment." He deadpanned, hoping
to god that the kid would ignore his warning. He'd wanted to fight
for a while now. Something in the back of his mind said he wanted to
impress the creator of those lovely little insects, but… He threw
that out.</P><P>The male before him smirked, one of
his arms wiggling in the sling. He laughed, "HAH! Looks like I have
movement in one of them… That's MORE than enough to take you
down!"</P><P>The injured male leapt forward,
going for a solid strike to Shino's face. Shino dodged, blocking
with one arm, not startled by the pain on the male's face. He was
even more surprised to see the triumphant look on the teens face.
"Take THIS!"</P><P>Suddenly, out of the palm of his
hand, an explosion of sound startled everyone in the building. Tohru
gasped, wanting to reach out and save Shino as he rolled away, his
ears ringing, and his body shaking. What the HELL?! His body ached,
and he turned to face his opponent. Everone looked on in startled on.</P><P>"Alright fool, you had enough
yet?" Saku growled, knowing that no one could take that directly
and still be able to hear. He was surprised however, when suddenly,
loud chittering shifted through the air, and everyone began to look
around, surprised and curious as to what was going on.</P><P>Shino stood, silent and watching, as
his kikaichu began to slide out of his skin, the holes that Saku had
blasted through it, helping quite a bit. The human hive bit his lip
behind his cowl, hoping that no one saw the pain on his face.</P><P>Kazu shuddered, his eyes riveted on
Shino. That is, until he heard the chittering coming from behind him.
He turned, careful to keep the silent nin in his sight, before
gasping. There was a swarm of beetles behind him, all staring
hungrily with beady black eyes. He shuddered again.</P><P>"They're a type of parasitic
beetle, that feed exclusively upon chakra… A swarm that size…
will suck you dry ina minute." Shino intoned, warning the male.
"You've only got one real option. Surrender. You can't fight
two enemies at once. Much less hundreds."</P><P>Zaku looked between the swarm and
Shino, the swarm and Shino… Finally, he bit his lip.</P><P>"I give." He shook his head. "I…
I'm done." He murmured, turning back to his team, shamed and
utterly useless. He was a broken ninja. He'd lost. He'd lost bad.
God dammit, why hadn't he been more careful in the forest!? Why had
he let himself be HURT like that?! He shuddered, thinking about those
damned Rock nin, and how he would get them back…</P><P>It took a bit to settle down the
crowd, and Naruto literally had to sit on Tohru's lap just to keep
him from going to Shino to make sure he was okay after that blast of
sound. He sighed, saddened by it.</P><P>The screen shifted again, sorting
through, and deciding the next match. Pretty much everyone groaned.
What was it with the girl against girl?!</P><P><B>Tenten Vs. Temari of the Sand</B></P><P>Temari smirked jumping down, and
using her fan to float down. Smiling, she waited for her bun-headed
opponent to follow. However, her eyes widened at the sight in front
of her. What a CUTIE! There was no WAY she was defeating THIS one too
quickly…</P><P>Purring, she slid her fan shut.
"Listen up little girl… If you see the third star on my fan…
You'll not only lose this match… You'll lose something else
precious too…" She smirked, "So please, just give up."</P><P>The brunette glared, "NO! I'm
going to win this!" She declared, pulling a shuriken. Temari
sighed, hoping she wasn't just a projectile weapons user. After
all, this would get boring real quick if she was. However, her hopes
were in vain, because it appeared she was. Launching a barrage of
shuriken that Temari swept away with a near invisible wave of her
fan.</P><P>"Projectiles aren't going to
work on me." She warned. After all, she didn't want this girl
hurt. She was far too cute.</P><P>"Shut up!" Tenten blushed,
glaring. How had the woman knocked away her weapons?! She growled,
pulling out a scroll, and through a series of complicated flips,
began literally barraging the blonde with weapons. It was obvious the
brunette had little left to her attacks, and no one was really
surprised when Temari knocked them away again. Though Gaara was THIS
close to just killing the girl.</P><P>Seeing this, Temari sighed. She
turned back to her new 'friend', and grinned, flicking open her
weapon of choice, showing one of the purple 'stars' on the
inside. "Two more stars to go, little one." Temari purred, still
standing where she'd started at the beginning of this match.</P><P>Brown eyes narrowed, and Tenten
growled, pulling two more scrolls. After a series of gestures,
obviously to use the girl's chakra to boost her physical reserves,
Temari watched as smoke burst out around her opponent.</P><P>"TWIN DRAGONS!" Tenten cried,
the scrolls rising, the smoke making the twirling objects look like
two dragons circling each other. She burst from the cover, opening
each one, and beginning her biggest barrage yet. Hundreds of weapons,
headed in Temari's direction.</P><P>And again, they were knocked away.
Not a single one reached their mark, and Tenten growled to see a
second purple circle on the fan's surface. She hated this. Flexing
her fingers, she used the razor thin wire attached to each weapon to
draw it back, aiming to send them after the girl again.</P><P>Temari knocked these away as well,
and smirked as the girl fell, hard, her wind knocking Tenten so off
balance that she couldn't even land properly. Smirking, Temari held
up her fan. "Three stars, little one… Time to end this."</P><P>Suddenly, she lifted the massive
paper fan, and cried out, "WHIRLWIND ART!" The winds in the arena
swirled, picking up Tenten in a cyclone of massive pain. It was like
blades of wind cutting into Tenten's soft skin, and Temari
regretted hurting such a beauty so, but… She had no choice.</P><P>As the jutsu ended, and the girl
fell, Temari caught her, holding her close. She grinned, "I told
you you'd lose… and here's the something precious…" She
purred, leaning in and stealing a kiss, hiding them both from the
sight of the spectators with her fan. She pulled back, leaving a
breathless and horrified Tenten blushing on the floor.</P><P>"WINNER! Temari of the Sand!"</P><P>END CHAPTER</P><P>Otaku: *sigh* finally… Sorry it
took so long. ^.^ hopefully, it was worth it though! Got a little
TentenTemari in there for you. XD</P><P>Tenten: BITCH! You stole my first
kiss!</P><P>Temari: *smirk* I'll steal a lot
more than that, darling…</P><P>Naruto: Awww… Love is in the air!</P><P>See you next time!</P>
