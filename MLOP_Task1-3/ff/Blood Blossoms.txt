But I do own this story; the environment and the objects, included.</b></p><p>"KYUUBI-SAMAAA!!" A man in his mid-40s shouted, deep wrinkle lines creasing with worry and annoyance. He's been looking around the huge garden, or should I say forest, for his little minx of a student. The prince has become more skilled at evading and hiding from him and the guards, these last few weeks. It has already been almost an hour, and still no sight of him. Not a hide or strand of hair in sight. Not even with the help of the guards.</p><p>'I guess it's a good thing that no one has found him yet.' He thought grudgingly. 'It's a positive sign that he is developing skills that would be useful to him when he becomes the King in the future.'</p><p>Unknown to the teacher, his troublesome student was calmly sitting on top of a tree, just fifteen paces from him. Blood-red hair flowed from the top of his head in wavy tresses touching his shoulders, amber eyes dancing with malicious glee at the sight of his distressed teacher, glinting a bit more at the thought of his plan. In the middle of his face sat his aristocratic nose; high cheek bones on either side of it and pink lips below it which opened to reveal a perfect set of white teeth to let out a barely compressed snicker.</p><p>This thirteen year old boy, as you've guessed it, is Crown Prince Kyuubi, future King of Konoha. Now, you must think that this boy is just a spoilt and insolent Prince, who thinks he's above studying, to run off in the middle of his lessons. And you must also think it inappropriate for his father, the current King of Konoha, to allow his son free reign to walk all over his teacher. However, this is also part of the training that the King wanted his son to participate in. Prince Kyuubi, is not only developing his skill in creativity, he is also developing skills of strategy, and he learns the right time to strike and to retreat – all qualities needed for the future King.</p><p>Besides, it was fun to see what kind of trouble his son did to his servants. These kinds of times were the only few that allow him fun and excitement, away from his usual tedious job as the King.</p><p>As of now, the Prince is ready to execute his plan. Carefully, he dropped his coat.</p><p>'THUMP'</p><p>As predicted, it immediately caught his teacher's attention. The teacher recognised the coat as the Prince's. He went to it and reached down, but before he could touch it, he gave out a startled yell as he was hoisted up in the air by his feet.</p><p>He looked up to see his feet tied together by a very thin thread, almost invisible to the eye. He heard hysterical laughing and looked to see his Prince holding onto his sides while trying to keep a steady balance on a branch.</p><p>"Your Highness, kindly put me down." He said as calmly as he could muster. But all he got was more laughing from the Prince. He snapped.</p><p>"You will put me down right now, you-you .. YOU-!" he was interrupted by a soft sniffling. He immediately shut his mouth and waved his arms frantically in fear.</p><p>"Ahh .. I'm-I'm s-sorry your Hi-highness. I-I di-didn't mean t-to sh-shout at y-you."</p><p>"I was only joking, Sensei." (Sniffle) "You didn't have to shout so (inhale shuddery breath)- so harshly."</p><p>He looked straight into his teacher's eyes. Amber clashing with black, his mouth trembling.</p><p>"So .. will you put me down now? .. – you Highness." He added as an afterthought.</p><p>Kyuubi went up to him, a gentle smile gracing his lips.</p><p>"No." a malicious grin suddenly breaking through the innocent mask.</p><p>And with that, he jumped down to the ground elegantly landing, stood up and dusted himself off. He looked up to his teacher and said, "Ja ne, Sensei.", before running off towards the castle.</p><p>3 … 2 … 1 … "HELP! SOMEBODY! HELP! PUT ME DOWN!! HEEEEEELLLPP!!!"</p><p>The Prince smirked to himself and gave himself a mental pat on the back. "Ahhh .. mission accomplished."</p><p>By a window, over-looking the massive garden, the King chuckled. 'Hahhh. Well, time for work.' He said in an internal voice that clearly wants to be doing something else entirely different.</p><p><b>First chapter finished. FINALLY.</b></p><p><b>Now, please review. I would especially like it if you make any suggestions that could improve my writing or the story.</b></p><p><b>Thank you for reading! Please come again!</b></p><p><b>Zanzi xxx</b></p>

UNWILLING ... NOW ON TO THE STORY .. </B></p><P><B>Naru-chan
– 10 yrs old</B></p><P><B>Ino,
Hinata, Sakura – 15 yrs old</B></p><P><B>Kyuubi
– 13 yrs old</B></p><P>zzz</p><P>"Naru-chaaann!!"</p><P>A
girl with a very light blonde hair called. She had light blue eyes,
which were scanning the stylish back garden.</p><P>Suddenly,
a bush to her right rustled and out popped spiky blonde hair, which
were not the same colour as hers, but much more brighter and lively.
He also had blue eyes which were much darker and alight with
innocence, he had a cute button nose, and smooth chubby cheeks which
were only flawed by three scars on both sides aligned in a way that
makes it look like whiskers. Soft plump rose lips, positioned in a
natural pout, making his over-all look so much more adorable.
Combined with his outfit, which was a common light brown kimono,
fading to dark brown at the bottom and his sleeves, kept closed by a
black obi; he was like an incarnation of an angel.</p><P>"Nani,
Ino-neechan?" he asked, in a childish voice while cocking his head
to the side.</p><P>The
girl couldn't take it and squeeled, "Kyaaa!! Naru-chan's so
kawaii!", while managing to choke Naruto in her death-grip.</p><P>"Ger
.. off .. can't .. b'..th .. nee .. ai .." ( Gerroff .. can't
breath .. need air ..) Naruto managed to gasp out. He was actually
clawing Ino's arms in a desperate bid to break free.</p><P>"Oh.
Sorry, got carried away. But Naru-chan, you have to tone down that
super-powerful cuteness of yours. Or else someone might just decide
to eat you right then and there." With that Naruto took on a look
of complete terror at the thought of being eaten.</p><P>"B-but,
Ino-chan, I'm-I'm not tasty; why would they want to eat me? Isn't
that ca .. cammabilisim?" He asked innocently, obviously not
understanding the real meaning of what Ino implied.</p><P>"It's
<I>cannibalism</I>."
Not bothering to correct the wrong assumption, "And don't worry,
Naru-chan, your Ino-neechan will protect you. And someday, maybe, you
will have your own prince charming to defend your .. urmm .. <I>honour</I>."</p><P>Naruto
blinked. He liked that. To be protected by someone. Maybe even loved
and cherished. Naruto was born and was brought up in the okiya. He
considers himself as one of the other hostesses. In his innocent
mind, he thought that his wee-wee was what everyone has when they
were young, and that it was going to disappear when he grows as old
as the other girls. Therefore, the idea of being with a man did not
disturb him in the least. He also thought that a person's gender
was decided as to how they were brought up. He was brought up like
the other girls so he thought he was going to be like them. Men, on
the other hand were brought up in a gruff and manly way, so they
don't lose their 'wee-wee'.</p><P>"Come.
Let's quit dilly-dallying, and get on to work. We're cleaning
Room 5, Kei-san just finished with her customer. Miyuki-okaasama's
getting frustrated. There are a lot of customers tonight, it's
getting very hectic." She said, and then looked softly at
Naru-chan.</p><P>"You
know how she gets when she get angry. She'll take it out on you for
sure." She said while pulling him out of the shrubbery. It was
easy. Even though he was ten, he was quite small and fragile-looking
than other kids his age, besides she was definitely older and
therefore stronger at the age of fifteen.</p><P>"Hai."
He said softly, immediately quickening his pace to get to the okiya.
He knows very well what will happen to him when Miyuki-okaasama gets
angry, too well. He is her personal punching bag to release her
frustrations on. Sometimes, when Ino-chan is feeling bold she will
try to stop the beatings but that only gets her in the fray. Naruto
doesn't want that.</p><P>Luckily,
they came at the right time because just as Naru-chan started on the
floor with a damp rag, Miyuki-okaasama burst into the room. She was a
beautiful woman, even with all the make-up on her face. She also had
a lot of rings on her fingers and she was holding a long thin
cigarette-holder with the cigarette at the end.</p><P>"Ino,
Mei, Naruto! Come, we have much more important guests to serve! The
room isn't even up to the very high standards that we boast! You
three will help with the preparations. But, Ino, I want you to do the
lighter jobs. You will be included as one of the hostesses that will
serve them.</p><P>"It's
Prince Kyuubi's birthday today. And you all know what that means.
So, I want everything to be perfect! We don't wanna lose to all
those other Houses." She sneered.</p><P>"We
will be using the Paradise room, as you all know."</p><P>The
three aforementioned were awed. The <I>Royalty</I>
.. the Prince .. was coming to pick out their best fancied hostess.
For any hostess, being bought by a man who loved them and cherish
them is like a dream come true. It was like the ultimate happiness
found for them. But a chance to be bought by a popular and wealthy
man cannot be passed up, especially <I>Royalty</I>.</p><P>"Well??!
What're you brats waiting for?! Bloody Christmas ??! Get off your
Goddamn butts and start working!!" she ordered.</p><P>The
three quickly scampered to do the orders, and practically zoomed to
the Paradise room, where they immediately set on the task of cleaning
and decorating it to the highest standard. They left the room
sparkling clean that anyone could even eat on the floor itself. The
guests won't be coming until later in the evening, so the hostesses
have more than enough time to get ready.</p><P>"Come."
Ino beckoned, "You were asked to help forehead-girl get ready. What
with being the current <I>number
one</I>
hostess, I very much doubt she wasn't included in this
arrangement." She sneered, obvious distaste to the mentioned girl
shown clearly through her facial expression.</p><P>"Demo,
you're number two, Ino-neechan. Why can't I help you get ready?"
he whined, with a cute pout on his lips. He didn't want to help
Sakura-forehead! She was always mean to him, and always trips him
when he's carrying something so he drops it and gets beaten by
Miyuki-okaasama. Besides, she always picks and makes fun of
Ino-neechan, and calls her pig-head when she wasn't even fat. In
fact, Ino-neechan has a nicer body than forehead-girl, she's slim
but with curves and boobs! Unlike Sakura, who's almost a flat-chest
and has no curves. She's only really pretty … and reeaalllyy
manipulative. Those two things are the only reasons why she has a
lot of customers demanding her; because she has them all wrapped in
her little finger.</p><P><I>5
years ago, he used to be constantly under her thumb. He remembered
one time, when he was resting after finishing all his tasks; she came
up to him and told him that he was ordered to go clean a particular
room. He didn't know at the time that it was the room
Miyuki-okaasama conducts business and money, and that no one was
allowed inside; even to clean it. Miyuki-okaasama personally cleans
it because she doesn't trust anyone with it; she thinks that they
will steal the money from her and run away. So, just about the time
he had started to clean the floor, the door slammed open to reveal
the horrific face of Miyuki-okaasama dark-red in anger. She came up
to him and pulled him by his clothes and dragged him out of the room
and into the cellar, where she proceeded to beat him while shouting
how </I><I><B>disgusting</B></I><I>
he is, and that he was just a </I><I><B>stupid
thief</B></I><I>
and an </I><I><B>ugly
monster</B></I><I>.
He didn't know how long she beat him, only that he passed out
somewhere along it, and that when he woke up there was only a glass
of water beside him. It took some time to get to it since every
muscle in his body was protesting. He didn't know how long he was
kept there, but he kept passing out. The next time he woke, he saw
Sakura in the room. She came up to him with a seemingly gentle smile,
almost looking kind. </I></p><P>"<I>How
does it feel?" she asked in mock concern, her face suddenly
twisting into a malicious sneer. "You have got to be the most
stupid and pathetic creature I have ever seen. Look at you. You're
so ugly and disgusting." He was so confused, hurt, angry and sad.
He was in too much pain to move so he just looked at her whilst
feeling all the intense emotions he felt inside at being degraded
further and further.</I></p><P><I>Sakura
looked down at him as he looked up at her with those melancholy blue
eyes, showing all different kinds of emotion that made his eyes glow
eerily. She hated that feeling of guilt that rose up to her chest as
she looked at him. She scowled darkly thinking it's some kind of
trick to make her release him. She sneered, grabbed his blood-matted
blonde hair and kicked him in the stomach, before storming out of the
room.</I></p><P><I>Sakura
didn't come back. He didn't know how long he was kept there, with
no food and only a glass of water to quench his thirst. He wasn't
even conscious when someone took him out of there to slowly recover
in his room. He vaguely remembered Ino helping to feed him, bathe him
and dress him. But he knew it was the worst experience he has ever
had in his entire life, even though it was a short 4 years. </I></p><P>"I
know you don't like her, God knows how much I don't either. But
you know how she is. She still thinks of you as her own property. And
she has to have at least ten flippin' people to assist her!
Mei-chan and Hinata-chan are helping me anyway, along with the other
servants. Ok?" she said, while softly ruffling his silky soft hair.</p><P>"M'kay."
Naru-chan murmured, a prominent pout forming his lips. Ino squealed
at the image he is unknowingly giving out and tried to squeeze the
life out of him. However, Naruto knew that squeal within a ten mile
radius and moved far out of reach just in time to save his life. Ino
pouted and switched to just patting his head.</p><P>"Ok,
you go to her room to help her and I'll go to mine to get ready."
With that she pushed him in the direction of Sakura's room. With a
scowl he went on his way to her room, not noticing himself slightly
gliding graciously.</p><P>However,
Ino did. She looked after his form with a sad thoughtful look on her
face. She remembered the very first time she saw him; he was only a
few seconds old, and he was already the most adorable baby she had
ever seen. Tufts of bright blonde hair scattered on top of his head,
cute nose and pink lips. He looked like a miniature replica of
Yukari-sama. The baby still couldn't open his eyes, and it was only
after a few hours later that he did. Unfortunately, he didn't get
to see his mother's face before she passed away; and she didn't
get to see her son's gorgeous blue eyes.</p><P>Yukari-sama;
the number one of the number one's hostesses in all of the Konoha
city's okiya's, died after giving birth to a healthy son. It was
a terrible night and many grieved for her death, Miyuki-sama more so
than others. Not because she saw Yukari-sama as her own daughter, no,
the real reason is that she knows her business would deflate a great
deal for the great loss. Yukari-sama was very kind and soft-spoken,
not to mention, she possess beautiful exotic looks and curvaceous
body. She only had to walk into a room and immediately all eyes were
on her. She lights up the atmosphere even when it was already light!
That's why she was adored by everyone. She has this kind of hidden
power that only she can cast.</p><P>A
lot of the richest men in the country pay huge amounts of money just
to spend an hour or two with her, most of the time just talking,
sipping tea and being entertained by her singing and dancing. She had
two <I>Danna's
</I>who
would have happily given her anything in the whole world, even the
largest diamond out there. But Yukari-sama being the kind and gentle
hostess that she is, only asked for little things, which enamoured
her <I>Danna's</I>
to her even more.</p><P>Yukari-sama's
day of 'deflowering' was a major event for all. Her virginity was
bought for the highest price known to any hostesses; of course, it
was one of her <I>Danna's</I>
who took it. After a year or so, she was pronounced pregnant. She and
her <I>Danna's</I>
didn't know which one fathered the baby, for they saw her at the
same month. The child cannot be acknowledged by the two Lord's,
even as their bastard child. She was advised to abort it, but she
adamantly refused. So, she continued her duties as a hostess even
whilst pregnant. And still, with this predicament, she was popularly
requested.</p><P>And
Ino could definitely see that Naru-chan is fast developing these
characteristics that Yukari-sama passed on to her only child. More
than once when they were shopping for food; men, women and children
alike flock around him for a pinch on his rosy chubby cheeks that
were growing redder after each passing moment, or a ruffle on his
already tousled soft spiky blond hair. This was actually the sole
reason for Naru-chan's fear of crowded places. But Ino always tries
to make him come when they shop, simply because when she's with
him, they get almost <B>everything</B>
for free. The vendors were always awarded by his charming big smile,
which makes them give even more stuff for free! Of course, for
Naru-chan to endure all the painful escapades through the throng of,
and she quotes, '<I>evil,
pinching, scary … monsters a-and beasts!'</I>
she always promised him 5 bowls of ramen from the money which wasn't
used, after all, he earned it.</p><P>'Aahh!!
I lost too much time. Gotta get ready!' With that, she ran into her
room and frantically but carefully got on the hot tub with Hinata.
They helped each other clean each others hairs and scrub their backs
with tantalizingly scented oils. She got on her best kimono which was
navy blue in colour with big, pretty white and red blooming flowers
adorning the bottom, its vines creeping up across her chest and back.
This was held together by a fuscia coloured obi. While Mei was
adjusting her obi, Hinata got started on her hair. She brushed the
long blonde hair that reached her hips.</p><P>"I
think we should keep your hair out, Ino-chan. It looks much better;
like a cascade of yellow waterfall on your back. The Royals will
definitely notice it. Don't you think so Mei-chan?." The soft
voice of Hinata said.</p><P>"Yeah.
And, maybe we could tie those gorgeous violet flowers all over it.
You know, like here, here, here and here." Mei replied, while
pointing at various areas on Ino's hair.</p><P>"That's
a good idea! I think it would look lovely on your hair , Ino-chan. I
forgot about those, Naru-chan picked them this morning. He gave
everyone one violet, except for some obvious individuals. And he said
he was going to give you the rest of it before we go to bed. Isn't
that sweet?" Hinata said while carefully tying the flowers on her
hair.</p><P>"Aaaaawwww."
Simultaneous cooing from the other girls.</p><P>"There,
finished. Ah, you look so stunning. Here look in the mirror."</p><P>Ino
looked, and she has to say, she looked goddamn gorgeous!</p><P>"Okay,
your turn Hina-chaaann." Ino exclaimed, giddy with excitement.</p><P>Ino
and Mei helped her get onto her midnight black kimono with amber
leaves being blown by light-grey coloured wind. It was secured by a
dark grey obi with small white leaves. Ino proudly did her hair,
which was up in a stylish Japanese fashion adorned with gold hair
ornaments and a simple fresh white orchid hanging from a thin, almost
invisible, line with pearls, to the left side held up by the
ornament. The grey colours complimented her lavender eyes and the
midnight black colour greatly but magnificently contrast her ivory
skin. To say it simply, she looked demurely gorgeous.</p><P>Mei
was one of the more common hostesses, so she wasn't assigned to
serve the Royals the only ones who will be serving them were (by
order of popularity 1-5): Haruno Sakura, Yamanaka Ino, Hyuuga Hinata,
Asuhara Satsuki and Fujioka Midori. Satsuki was Mei's big sister
and she was very proud of her. She's on her way to help her.</p><P>Finally
ready Hinata and Ino set on to the go to the assigned room.</p><P>Aizawa
Kenzo was purposefully walking towards his 'otoutou's bedroom. He
expects him to be his ready, charming-self; after all, tonight is the
<I><B>night</B></I>
… the night that his 'otoutou' would start his collection, the
collection of his … <B>harem</B>.</p><P>Kenzo
is Kyuubi's older cousin. They grew up together, so they're
practically brothers. He was adopted by the family when he was 11
years old, after his parents died in an ambush by rogue ninjas. He is
now a healthy 18 years old with an equally healthy libido, which
Kyuubi always seem to get the brunt of.</p><P>Kenzo
has already acquired a variety of voluptuous women and gorgeous men.
He started at the age of 13; the standard starting age. Their father
has more than a hundred, combined between the men and the women.
Before, it was only quite a few numbers of concubines, but when his
wife met a tragic end by cancer, he started obtaining more and more
of them.</p><P>He
didn't bother knocking and barged into the room, only to stare
disbelievingly at the younger boy.</p><P>"You're
still not <I>ready</I>??!
This is the night that you could finally be … <I>deflowered</I>."
he winked at Kyuubi as he said the last word, intending for the
younger boy to be embarrassed.</p><P>He
smirked as he succeeded. A faint tint was splashed across the boy's
cheeks.</p><P>"Aaawww,
are you nervous Kyuu-chaaann?"</p><P>"Don't
call me that!" growled Kyuubi, gracefully stepping off the small
stool as the servants finished the last touches on his kimono. He was
attired in a verdant green kimono with bamboos on his left side and
its thin pointy leaves blowing around towards the back of the kimono
as if blown by an invisible wind. It was a masterpiece of the most
famous kimono weaver in their country, and it was given as a gift to
the young Crown-Prince.</p><P>"Aaww,
Kyuu-chan, don't be so harsh." Kenzo replied, "you're my cute
wittle virgin otoutou. I wuv you." Trying and (unknown to him)
failing to make puppy-dog eyes.</p><P>"Pssshh!
Puh-lease! Like you can make yourself look innocent." Kyuubi
retorted. "And please, for the love of everything sacred and
beautiful, don't ever attempt to do a cute puppy-dog eyes, it only
results in making you look constipated."</p><P>"Ooohh!
And I don't suppose you think you can?!"</p><P>"Of
course! Any person with at least half an ounce of gorgeousness can do
it! And since I have that 110, I, perfected it."</p><P>"Pfffftt!!
(suppressed laughing) Can't you, at least, change the script? I
must have heard that line a thousand times already!! It's getting
rather mundane."</p><P>Kyuubi
glared for a second before suddenly jerking his head away. Kenzo was
a bit startled by the sudden change of attitude. He thought that this
was their usual banter. He didn't even know what offended his
otoutou; he's said much worse than that and Kyuubi always comes
back with something equally venomous or even more venomous! Before he
can even think another thought, Kyuubi slowly turned his head.</p><P>Kyuubi
knew his Aniki's defences were down. That's what he actually
intended when he jerked his head away, after all. He turned his head
to slowly face him – it makes for good effect and suspense! He saw
his Aniki's figure at the corner of his eye, tense. He smirked
inwardly, and finally turned to his Aniki's face fully.</p><P>GASP!!</p><P>'Goddammit!!
That brat really <I>did</I>
perfect it!' Kenzo exclaimed to himself as he looked upon his
otoutou. Gone were the glinting mischievous eyes that he usually
held, replaced with overdramatically big puppy dog eyes. Kyuubi's
eyes were filled with unshed tears, ready to drop at any second,
making his eyes seem to shine with guilt, hope and innocence.</p><P>Kenzo
visibly gulped. He hoped to God his otoutou doesn't realize his
actual reaction to this. If he did .. well, Kenzo predicts a gloomy
and bleak future for himself. God only knows what his brother will
ask of him, to which he'll follow on command, like a dog on a
leash! He suppressed the shudder that his body threatened to release,
when he thought of the .. less than pleasant .. well, less than <I>dire
</I>requests
his otoutou can .. no, <I>will</I>
make. He tried to make a good enough comeback to prevent his brother
from finding out … <I><B>ever.</B></I>
He succeeded as he made his lips widen into a grin and closed his
eyes – because he knows that the 'your eyes are the windows to
your soul' -, thinking of lots of weird things … liiike, his
Father in a tutu!! … Oh, eeewww! …that's freaky! But it worked.
Heh! Dad in a tutu, that's actually quite funny now. His forced
grin became not so forced anymore.</p><P>"Awww,
Kyuu-chan. See! Even you admit it to yourself. I know, you know, I
know, you know it deep, deep down. You're <I>cute</I>!</p><P>Puppy
dog eyes suddenly dropped to a deadly scowl and glare, all directed
at the guy who dared to call him cute and still live to tell the
tale. "I am NOT <I>cute</I>!!!</p><P>"Yea-huh!"</p><P>"Nuh-uh!"</p><P>"Yea-huh!"</p><P>"Nuh-uh!"</p><P>"Yea-huh!
We can do this all night. I don't care; I'm not the one who's
going out to get laid. I can get laid in the room next door if I want
to. All I have to do is call one of my concubines and, voila! I'm
laid. I can even get laid right here, right now. Whereas you can't,
you know why? 'coz you don't even have one." Kenzo smirked
smugly.</p><P>"If
I find out you took one of your harem in this room and fucked them
here in <B>MY</B>
room, so help me .. I will castrate you!" Kenzo, upon hearing the
threat, immediately closed his legs with a snap and held both hands
over where his royal jewels were.</p><P>"And
I don't care about getting laid. I didn't even want to go out and
get one anyway." He shrugged and flopped on his bed. He looked up
and to his amusement, saw his Aniki-chan wearing an exaggerated
scandalized look.</p><P>"Are
you crazy?!! Stop using your brain upstairs and use the one
downstairs!! We're talking about <I>sex,
glorious sex</I>!!
He exclaimed, actually singing the tune in Oliver Twist's 'food,
glorious food'.</p><P>"To
think, my own otoutou wasn't even intending to lose his virginity
and get laid. OHH!! The horror!" he exclaimed, one hand clutching
his chest, the back of the other hand daintily on top of his forew
head, in faux distress. He began staggering towards Kyuubi before
dropping backwards next to him, on the bed.</p><P>He
groaned and began convulsing, and with on sharp breath, "Errk!"
he put his tongue out while facing Kyuubi his formerly closed eyes
opening slightly to gauge his reaction.</p><P>Kyuubi
only raised an eyebrow at him, but his eyes showed mirth at his
antics. Kyuubi shook his head before boxing him on top of his head.
Kyuubi gave a look of pure wickedness that would have made Kenzo run
with his tail between his legs, if only they weren't closed, but
alas, he closed them after seeing Kyuubi's reaction the first time.
And so without further ado, Kyuubi gasped as melodramatically as
Kenzo did and jumped on his chest. He grabbed the 'lifeless' body
of Kenzo and proceeded in shaking it. With one hand on the front of
his yukata, he used the other to give loud (and painful) slaps on
both sides of his face. With each pause of slap, he said, "Don't
.. die .. on .. me .. now .. Kenz .. !"</p><P>"OOOOUUUCCCHHH!!!!
Gerroff you little minx!" Kenzo shrieked, dumping Kyuubi's body
on the other side of the bed. "SHEEESH! I was only acting, was I so
good that you actually believed me?!"</p><P>"Yeah,
keep telling yourself that." Kyuubi replied. "But, fine." He
said with exasperation. "I'll go, if only to prevent a heart
attack from you, or as you called it your <I>'acting'.</I>
I didn't think you could actually look even more like a constipated
idiot, guess I was wrong."</p><P>Kenzo
was by the door half-way through when he said 'fine'. He didn't
even here his speech about his constipated expressions. Kyuubi looked
at him incredulously.</p><P>"Could
you <I>be</I>
any hornier?!" the rhetorical question came out of his mouth as he
was getting up from the bed.</p><P>"Actually,
I can."</p><P>Again,
Kyuubi shot him an incredulous look. "That was a rhetorical
question, you dimwit!"</p><P>As
he was making his way towards the door, he ungracefully tripped on a
small crease at the edge of the Russian rug. He braced himself with
his hands to stop his fall while closing his eyes. But instead of the
cold, hard and not to mention, humiliating floor, he was cushioned by
something softer but still firm.</p><P>He
opened his eyes to look at fine blue delicately woven silken fabric;
which he concluded to be a yukata. A yukata owned and being worn by
none other than his idiotic cousin-cum-brother. He looked up to see a
huge grin plastered on his lips, two mischievous hazel eyes which
were glinting in some unknown, but rather scary shine.</p><P>"Now,
now, Kyuu-chan. If you had wanted <I>moi</I>
to de-flower you; you only had to ask." Kenzo said, tightening his
grip around his waist.</p><P>That's
when Kyuubi finally came to his normal set of brains and concluded
that when he tripped; he, unfortunately, fell on Kenzo. 'Ah, great!
Just what the doctor recommended, more humiliation.'</p><P>"Kenzo,
let go!" Kyuubi ordered calmly, while trying to pry the
surprisingly tight and insistent grip around his waist.</p><P><I>WARNING:
T-rating coming up! … hehehe .. BlackMage16 and DiamondStylez look
away now, naughty clip coming up!! LOOOOOL </I></p><P>"Aww,
don't be shy Kyuu-chan." Kenzo said in a playful tone. He leaned
close to Kyuubi's left ear, which was hidden by his red locks.
"I'll take you gently and softly … and then hard." He said in
a husky note that made electricity shoot up his spine, telling him
his statement is serious and true.</p><P>Kenzo
slowly licked a path from the juncture between his shoulder and neck;
not stopping as he brushed the locks away to reveal more skin. The
path took Kenzo to his ear, where he proceeded to lick the shell and
the inside which made Kyuubi tighten his hands that were on Kenzo's
chest, into fists. 'Ohh my Gooodd! Are my ears <I>that</I>
sensitive? If he keeps this up I don't know if I would be able to
hold my moans any longer.' Kyuubi thought, not knowing that his
face told the story of what was going on in his head. Kenzo smirked,
before kissing a path along his jaw to his mouth, where he gently
kissed him, slowly but firmly. This time, Kyuubi moaned. The
sensation of Kenzo's lips massaging his lips was too much, even the
possessively tight hold he's in, is turning him on.</p><P>Kenzo
loosened his tight hold just a little, while moving one of his hands
down to grab one tight buttock, making Kyuubi squeak and open his
–unconsciously- closed eyes to stare accusingly at him. He also
opened his mouth to scream protest, but was promptly silenced to a
deeper moan when Kenzo slipped his tongue inside. He slid his tongue
map Kyuubi's mouth, sliding along his teeth and the roof if his
mouth, which prompted a deep purr out of him. He finally slid his
tongue alongside Kyuubi's, swirling and sliding along each other.
This made his knees buck, and if it weren't for Kenzo's strong
hold, he'd be on the floor in a boneless heap of mush.</p><P>Air
is a must for all living creatures, so with great reluctance, both
pulled away. Kyuubi, being much more new to this gulped in lungfuls
of air, while Kenzo who recovered much more quickly pecked his mouth
every lungful.</p><P><I>Naughty
clip finished .. you can look now! </I></p><P>Kenzo
truly wanted to take Kyuubi. Who wouldn't?! He's an immensely
cute boy who, he knows, will grow up to be a gorgeous young man.</p><P>Kenzo
stepped away, immediately missing the warmth and knows that Kyuubi
does too, if the small pout was o be any indication. He smiled. "You
ready to go now?"</p><P>Kyuubi
took a second to straighten his yukata while dusting imaginary dusts
off. "Yeah."</p><P>They
started walking to make their way towards the car that will take them
to each of the most famous Okiya's. "So,umm .. about what-"</p><P>"Spurr
of the moment, kind of thing. Why? Was it your first? Aww, Kyuu-chan,
I'm honoured. Maybe I could be Your first on the other one, as
well." He said, wiggling his eyebrows, obviously back to his
idiotic self, "I'll keep my promise. I'll take softly and
gently .. than hard, and then even harder." He smirked at the
terrified look on Kyuubi's face, before slapping his arse then
sprinting off.</p><P>…</p><P>"JERK!!"</p><P>zzz</p><P><B>Yay!
This is the 2</B><B>nd</B><B>
chappie finished. Hope you all liked it. And if you do .. well what
