<p>"<b>You know
brat...For human years we've been together for quite some time
now...</b>" The Kyuubi said to his container, who was meditating
in front of his cage.</p><p>Far away from it but still
in front of the cage.</p><p>"It's not like I had
a choice in that matter, now did I?" The spikey blonde shinobi
asked, trying not to pay attention.</p><p>"<b>Neather did
I...Actually if I could I would have wrecked havoc in that village of
yours all over again no matter how many times a <i>hero</i> seals me
up.</b>" The Kyuubi said as his eyes glared furiously when
saying the word hero.</p><p>"Ofcourse you would,
you're a demon after all, you retarded fox." The shinobi said,
trying to keep his focus.</p><p>"<b>Didn't you ever
wonder <i>why</i> I attacked Konoha and nowhere else? Aren't you even
the least bit interested in finding out, Naruto?</b>" The fox
asked the blonde.</p><p>"Since when do
you..." Naruto said as he looked wide eyes at the fox.</p><p>"<b>Know your name?
I've been locked up in you for over fifteen years, I even know what
you ate for breakfast on this day five years ago...Don't be naive
boy.</b>" The Kyuubi said.</p><p>"That's because I eat
the same thing for breakfast every day you retard!" Naruto
yelled.</p><p>"<b>Answer my
question already...Did you ever wonder why I attacked the leaf?</b>"
Kyuubi repeated his question.</p><p>"Er...Like you felt
like being all demon like and kill people and you predicted you'd be
stuck in my head untill I died and you wanted to make my life a
living hell?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"<b>If I knew I was
going to be stuck with a bart like you I wouldn't have even bothered
trying to recue her...Well..that's untrue, but I'd have been more
careful...</b>" The kyuubi said.</p><p>"Rescue her? What are
you talking about..." Naruto asked as he was obviously confused
with the tone the Demon Fox spoke with right then.</p><p>"<b>Since you aren't
the type who'd be able to listen to my life's story I'll try to sum
things up...Who knows...You might even find yourself to have a change
of heart about certain matters.</b>" The Kyuubi said and
chuckled.</p><p>"...Whatever. Just
tell what you want to tell while I meditate...Stupid Ero-sennin with
stupid ideas for stupid training while being near that stupid fox..."
Naruto muttered the last of his sentence.</p><p>"<b>Hmm...Interesting...Let's
see if you're interested in my realm...</b>" The Kyuubi said.</p><p><b>My realm, the
demon world or 'Hell' as you humans call it, isn't that much
different from your own world. My people, your demons,
are just like humans aside from the fact that we have a natural
greater power. You might even call it
a power of evil if you want but good and evil are irrelevant in my
world.</b></p><p><b>In this realm, we
'demons' are born like humans and died like humans, though we live
far longer then mankind does. We have emotions,
feelings, friends and enemies, meaning we're are just like mankind
only more powerful.</b></p><p><b>However there is a
difference in power gained in my world and your world, brat. In your world, power is
gained trough training and some people called geniusses are naturally
stronger then average humans.</b></p><p><b>In my world, we are
born with a destiny and a certain amount of power sealed up inside
us.</b></p><p><b>Do training can make us
stronger and with the right amount of training you could surpass a
'demon' who is supposed to be stronger then you, but if that 'demon'
you want to surpass would always have more power then you would have
if he or she trained hard enough as well.</b></p><p><b>The only significant
difference in our world is that names are meaningless for most of us
unless you have enough strength or came from a certain family.</b></p><p><b>The 'demon' world is
ruled by the Bijuu, including me after my rise.</b></p><p><b>I was the incarnation
of the previous Kyuubi no Kitsune, naturally born with the potential
to be one of the nine lords and ladies that rule the realm.</b></p><p><b>We trained our entire
lives to obtain strength. And even though you
would find it unlikely, brat, all of us laugh and fall in love as
well...</b></p><p><b>That last was what
happened to me, something I don't know if it was good or not. I was still young, a
bit older then you if you need to make a comparrison, and had yet to
unlock my full power.</b></p><p><b>But that didn't mean I
was weak, after all I was already one of the bijuu, ruling lord of
what would be your Country of Fire on the demon realm.</b></p><p><b>It was during a
beautiful spring night that I met her. I finished my training
for the day and placed my katana back in it's sheath.</b></p><p><b>I walked along the
river that headed towards what I used to call my hometown. It was at the bank of
that river that I met her.</b></p><p><b>Long red hair, floating
trough the wind, kind crimson red eyes and a face that I shall never
forget. She was a beauty, a
true beauty and she even was a kitsune.</b></p><p><b>I walked past her
towards my hometwon, not saying a word the first time, my mind trying
to focus on other matters. But after each training
near the river, I would encounter and steadily I started to talk to
her.</b></p><p><b>We got close after hundreds
of you human's years and I fell in love with her.</b></p><p><b>However it was at the
beginning of october when we were both adults, that disaster struck
and would be the end of what you might call my 'heart'.</b></p><p><b>She was taken away from
me, summoned trough a dark ritual in your world.</b></p><p><b>They wanted to destroy
her and use her demonic powers for their own purposes.</b></p><p><b>"Do not go
Kyubi-sama, you don't know what effects your chakra will have on you"
is what the elders told me.</b></p><p><b>But I didn't listen,
after all what did they know about my love for her.</b></p><p><b>I used everything in my
strength to find how she had been taken to your world. And I found it, but as
soon as I went trough the portal, it was the end of my normal life.</b></p><p><b>I found her lying dead
on the ground in a to me unknown forest, a man towering above her
with a grin on his face.</b></p><p><b>"I knew you'd
come..." He muttered but all I could focus right then and there
was that my love was killed and that the one who had done this had to
die.</b></p><p><b>My red eyes burned with
chakra as I looked up towards the pale man who stood above my love. My dark red chakra
leaked out of me and soon my body started to change into what you see
before you this day...A nine tailed fox.</b></p><p><b>In my rage I roared and
slammed my tails against the mountains, crumbling them to pieces. I looked down towards
the ground to find the human who killed my love gone.</b></p><p><b>My rage build up even
more and I looked up towards the sky. As my fur spiked up out
of rage I saw a large town nearby and decided that the people there
were responsible.</b></p><p><b>I let out a roar, my
chakra burning the trees beneath me, and soon sound myself attack the
village.</b></p><p><b>The Hidden Village of
Leaf...</b>" The Kyuubi finsihed his summary of his story.</p><p>Naruto stared at the demon
fox in amazement as he was carried away by the emotions that he felt
coming from the demon fox's voice.</p><p>"<b>And next thing
you know, they have some powerful guy sitting on a frog sealing my
raging ass into the little pip squeak that was you...</b>" The
Kyuubi said and let out a slight growl at the thought of being
defeated so easily.</p><p>"I never knew that
you attacked because you lost someone precious to you..." Naruto
said as he stared at the fox.</p><p>"<b>Well you know
now. Why do you think you gain all that power from me when you get so
highly emotional, huh brat? I recognize myself in you...Though that
is somewhat pittiful for a fearsome demon like me to say about a
human.</b>" The Kyuubi said.</p><p>"Oi, since your world
is similiar to mine, does that mean you have shinobi and justu as
well?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"<b>Who do you think
you are brat...You won't learn any jutsu from me.</b>" The
Kyuubi growled, figuring that it was that what his host wanted to ask
from him.</p><p>"Heh, I don't need
your stinking jutsus anyway...I just wondered if you had more to your
life then just 'I must be the strongest demon!'...that's all."
Naruto said as he crossed his arms.</p><p>"<b>Hnnn...</b>"
The Kyuubi narrowed his eyes at Naruto.</p><p>"What?" Naruto
asked.</p><p>"<b>Hnnnnnnnnn...</b>"
The Kyuubi narrowed his eyes even closer.</p><p>"WHAT DATTEBAYO!"
Naruto yelled.</p><p>"<b>Are you actually
interested in my life story?</b>" Kyuubi asked grinning widely.</p><p>"Maybe...I doubt it's
more fun and interesting then mine." Naruto replied.</p><p>"<b>We'll see about
that.</b>" The Kyuubi said and started chuckling as he raised a
wide demonic fox grin.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>A/N:
This is a little something that I came up with. If people like it and
want me to continue the story you'll have to let me know. I won't
update it very fast I have other fics to attend to but I like the idea
I have about this story. Let's hear it if you guys like it as well :)
Review wether you like it or not XP.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p>A/N: Yo everyone! Since a lot of people were positive
about the first chapter and the idea, I decided to continue it for all
of you who do like it (and ofcourse by the time I place this, it is
possible for more people to start liking it...And to the people that
are new around here and unregistered, you an still review XD) Also,
I'll leave Kyuubi's gender up to your immagination, but Kyuubi-sama
will no matter what be with a woman...Though I did think of something
like 'moments' between Kyuubi and one of his male team-mates, no
kissing or...other things will happen between Kyuubi and a guy, sorry
fangirls but you prolly don't like Kyuubi that much anyway compared to
Naruto XP</p><p>Now on with the story!<b><br>
</b></p><p><b><hr size=1 width=100% noshade></b></p><p><b>When you mess with a
seal, you mess with a kitsune:</b></p><p>"Focus...Focus...Focus...Focus..."
Naruto chanted as he was still meditating in front of the Kyuubi's
cage.</p><p>"<b>Achoo!</b>"
The Kyuubi sneezed, blowing Naruto away and making him tumble a
couple of times over the shallow water that surrounded the area
around Kyuubi's prison.</p><p>"...Grrr...Stupid
Ero-sennin saying that I should meditate in front of the Kyuubi's
cage to make my mind more focussed and all..." Naruto muttered
as he got up. Kyuubi grinned widely and
slightly laughed at hearing the blonde shinobi.</p><p>"<b>So brat, while I
focus shall I tell you an interesting thing that your small mind
probably didn't know yet...?</b>" Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"...You've been
interupting me so far, so I doubt anything I say will change your
mind dumb fox." Naruto muttered as he walked back towards where
he stood before.</p><p>"...<b>Did you know
that seals are the ost powerful thing in the world? I mean look at
the piece of paper that has the kanji seal on it sticking these bars
together, it's keeping someone as powerful as me stuck in your little
pipsqueek body. Doubt you could say that it's that strong, right?</b>"
Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"...Heh, I bet I
could easily break any seal...I just need to focus enough..."
Naruto muttered as he folded his hands in the standard chakra mold
seal and started mentally focusing again.</p><p>"<b>I bet you
couldn't even make a mark in it with a chakra extended kunai using my
chakra...</b>" Kyuubi replied, which unfocussed Naruto
immediately.</p><p>"Teh, I could pull
that piece of paper off with my bare hands." Naruto said.</p><p>"<b>I doubt it that
someone of your calibur could...</b>" Kyuubi said, ticking
Naruto enough to make him turn around and snap at the fox.</p><p>"WHAT! THE HELL I
CAN! I'M GOING TO BE HOKAGE ONE DAY AND I'LL EASILY TEAR THAT SEAL OF
RIGHT NOW IF I WANTED TO!" Naruto yelled in frustration.</p><p>"<b>Then, show me
that you can...Though I highly doubt it.</b>" Kyuubi replied
grinning widely.</p><p>Naruto ran towards the
large prison bars, quickly molded chakra under his feet, for his
chakra control had improved a lot after training with Jiraiya the
past few years, and ran up the Kyuubi's prison, stopping at the paper
that said 'seal'.</p><p>"Now I'll show you
that I'm strong enough to easily rip of this piece of paper!"
Naruto yelled as the fox narrowed his eyes at Naruto in amusment.</p><p>Naruto dug his nails under
the paper and Kyuubi slightly widened his eyes that Naruto actually
could get his fingers under it.</p><p>"Why you, why you,
why you!" Naruto said as he pulled with all his might.</p><p>"<b><i>Are you
kidding me...?</i></b>" Kyuubi thoughts as Naruto slowly pulled
the more of the seal of the prisonbars.</p><p>In his state of shock, he
forgot that now he could most likely ram the prisonbars to break
trough them, but instead he watched amazed as naruto pulled the seal
off.</p><p>However, the seal
continuesly tried to pull itself back onto the prison with an thick
and dense chakra letting out lightning, which shot all trough the
envirement of the Kyuubi's cage.</p><p>As the lightning ran over
the prison bars, guided it self over the water and struck at the
walls, Kyuubi's eyes shifted uncontrollably all over the place,
wondering what was going on as he was still far too shocked. Naruto continued pulling
at the seal and Kyuubi's state of shock faded away as the prison
slightly opened up.</p><p>"<b><i>Freedom!</i></b>"
His mind screamed as Kyuubi let out an earth shattering roar and
darted forward.</p><p>Just as the tip of his
nose touched the prison gats, Naruto couldn't hold the seal anymore. The seal instantly slammed
back onto the gates, closing them once more. Naruto fell down from the
prison as his surroundings shook from the impact the doors made onto
the Kyuubi.</p><p>Not to mention that the
movements of the prisondoors itself shook the envirement. Naruto rubbed his butt and
got back up.</p><p>"Kuso...I was so
close to pulling it fully of as well...but see dumbass fox! I am
strong enough to pull it off atleast!" Naruto cheered and rubbed
the back of his head.</p><p>The demon fox was silent
in his cage, making Naruto look at the fox, wondering if something
happened to him.</p><p>"Oi? Like...did it
effect you or something?" Naruto asked as he looked at the fox.</p><p>His large body of chakra
was still present but it looked like the Kyuubi had his eyes closed
or something. Just then everything went
white in front of Naruto's eyes.</p><p>A few seconds later Naruto
woke up and stared at his perverted sensei, who was towering above
him with a short of shocked expression.</p><p>"Yo Ero-sennin, What
happened?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"...Naruto, what have
you done is what I'm wondering..." Jiraiya said, no hint of the
usual sillines his sensei shows most of the time when Naruto
collapses after training.</p><p>"What are you talking
about?" Naruto asked as he blinked at Jiraiya.</p><p>"That's what I'm
talking about." Jiraiya said pointing towards the right of him.</p><p>The Kyuubi meanwhile had
somewhat awakened from his previous state.</p><p>----Kyuubi's PoV----</p><p>Though I didn't open my
eyes yet, my nose picked up a strange scent. It was a mixing a
forest-like smell combined with sake and something else I found
rather familiar.</p><p>Wondering what it was I
opened my eyes to find not only Naruto towering above me but also his
perverted sensei. Naruto looked shocked and
Jiraiya looked at me like I'd be near the point to do something.</p><p>What I wondered was how Jiraiya
got in to Naruto's mind. Just then I noticed that
my surroundings had changed.</p><p>"<b><i>Soft
ground...Different envirement...Did that little messing with the seal
mess up his mind as well or something?</i></b>" I thought as I
looked around.</p><p>"Is that really...?"
Naruto said as he pointed at me.</p><p>"Hm...Looks like
it...Don't know how you did it but this could be troublesome...I
think it can hear us. It should be able to speak or something..."
Jiraiya said as he stared at me.</p><p>"Oi are you really
the Kyuubi?" Naruto asked as he looked kind of dully at me.</p><p>"<b>Let's see, I have
nine tails, as far as I can tell I'm still me and I'm a demon
fox...Does that answer your question brat? Now I have one for you.
How the hell come you are so big and why the hell has your mind
turned into a forest?</b>" I growled at them.</p><p>"Ehm...It's more
like...You got smaller and...This is pretty much not my mind."
Naruto replied. I blinked at him then at
his sensei who stood next to him, still eyeing me awkwardly.</p><p>"<b>I got smaller? I
can't get smaller as my chakra is big and...This is not your mind!
Then what is it!</b>" I realised it a bit late, but this was
weird even for me. I guess something messed
up my mind or something because the pieces slowly started to fall
together.</p><p>"Our world?"
Naruto asked as he looked at Jiraiya, who shortly nodded.</p><p>"<b>...If I'm free,
then I'm out of here.</b>" I said as I turned around and started
walking away, but as I made a short distance I suddenly couldn't walk
any further.</p><p>I looked around and
noticed a thick red chakra string heading towards Naruto's stomach.</p><p>"Looks like you
can't, Kyuubi no Kitsune...Naruto I don't know what you did but it
looks like though you released the Kyuubi somehow most of his chakra
is still sealed up inside you..." Jiraiya stated.</p><p>"<b>Then I'll make
you unseal it and I'll conquer this world starting with you two.</b>"
I threatened them, for I knew I still had enough chakra to cause some
serious damage.</p><p>"I don't think so.
Looks like you can't get away from Naruto, meaning you'll have to
come with us so we can find out what exactly happened." Jiraiya
said.</p><p>I narrowed my eyes at the
two of them and started to flare up my chakra, ready to use my powers
as best as I could. I intended to let out a
growl, letting them know I was serious about fighting, but instead
something else growled, something I hadn't heard in a long time.</p><p>My stomach, I was hungry.</p><p>"<b>...This isn't
very good for me...</b>" I stated.</p><p>-----Normal PoV----</p><p>"Looks like you can't
do that much right now huh. Then, you're coming with us. Naruto,
I'll..." Jiraiya said.</p><p>"<b>You'll go and
report to who ever it is you have to report this event to and me and
the brat will have a little talk.</b>" The Kyuubi interupted
Jiraiya abrubtly.</p><p>"I don't think so."
Jiraiya stated.</p><p>"<b>If you think I'm
planning on attack your beloved village again or influence that brat
over there, you're a fool.</b>" Kyuubi replied.</p><p>"There's no need to
worry Ero-Sennin. He's just a little fox now, he couldn't even harm
anyone." Naruto said grinning widely.</p><p>"<b>Who says I can't
harm anyone? These claws and fangs still are fully able to piece a
couple of things in this world...</b>" Kyuubi growled.</p><p>"No you can't cause
if you're attached to me I can just run away from you and then you
can't reach anyone." Naruto said pointing at Kyuubi.</p><p>"<b>...If I remember
correctly YOU are pretty damn close to these natural weapons of
mine...</b>" Kyuubi replied.</p><p>"And I can beat you
up badly as well after all the training Ero-sennin gave me..."
Naruto said glaring at Kyuubi.</p><p>"<b>And indeed THAT
surpasses hundreds years of training...</b>" Kyuubi replied
sarcastically.</p><p>"What was that!"
Naruto yelled.</p><p>"Naruto! Be quiet for
a while!" Jiraiya said. Naruto immediately shut up
and looked at Jiraiya.</p><p>"If you can, go to
your home without anyone seeing the Kyuubi...I'll meet you there
later. Can you do that?" Jiraiya asked.</p><p>Naruto slightly nodded and
looked towards the Kyuubi agian, who was grinning widely with his
typical fox grin.</p><p>"Then I'm leaving it
to you Naruto, see it as a high ranked mission to get the Kyuubi into
your home without anyone noticing him..." Jiraiya stated and
jumped off.</p><p>Just as Jiraiya left,
Kyuubi jumped ontop of Naruto's head and sat down on it.</p><p>"<b>Alright let's go
brat.</b>" Kyuubi commanded.</p><p>"Oi! Don't command me
damned fox!" Naruto yelled at the demon fox.</p><p>"<b>I didn't, your
sensei did...Now let's get going...No need to worry about people
seeing me, I look just like a normal fox welp.</b>" Kyuubi
stated.</p><p>"Yeah, but you have
like ya know nine..."</p><p>"<b>Tails, yeah
yeah...Look here boy, I entangled all nine of them to make one big
fuzzy tail to save you from bothering to hide me...Now let's go
already, I want to have some decent food after being locked up for
fifteen years.</b>" Kyuubi said, Naruto starting to walk back
towards Konoha.</p><p>"By the way
fox...What EXACTLY do you eat?" Naruto asked as he looked up
towards the fox who was staring forward.</p><p>"<b>You really want
to know?</b>" Kyuubi asked, Naruto nodding in reply.</p><p>"<b>Very, very sure
you want to know?</b>" Kyuubi asked, Naruto nodding more.</p><p>"<b>Human souls...</b>"
Kyuubi said, Naruto nearly falling over from hearing the Kyuubi's
response.</p><p>"<b>It amazes me how
you humans are really thinking just because it's other then the rest
of you it has to eat different or the likes...I haven't eaten in a
long time due to being locked up...and other things...so do I really
care what I get to eat? Not really...</b>" Kyuubi stated. Naruto groaned in reply
and continued walking.</p><p>"<b>Alright kid, like
I said before you and I got to talk.</b>" Kyuubi said.</p><p>"What is it?"
Naruto asked.</p><p>"<b>Well, I'm
surprised that you nearly succeeded in pulling the seal completely
off...Even though it sucks to be so little...though it might have
some advantages...</b>" The Kyuubi's eyes then trailed off to a
couple of skirt wearing girls that walked on the other road leading
trough the forest, Naruto coughing to get the Kyuubi's attention
back.</p><p>"<b>What?</b>"
Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"Nothing, Nothing at
all dattebayo...ero-kitsune..." Naruto replied.</p><p>"<b>There's nothing
wrong with liking women, brat...Actually I'm starting to wonder if
you swing the other way when it comes to that...</b>" The Kyuubi
whispered the last sentence.</p><p>"WHAT! I DO LIKE
WOMEN! JUST NOT IN PERVERTED WAYS LIKE YOU AND ERO-SENNIN! YOU
ERO-KITSUNE!" Naruto snapped.</p><p>"<b>So, you're
telling me, the one who has been in your mind for fifteen years, that
you never ever even thought of women in that way?</b>" The
Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"No I don't. Not.
One. Bit." Naruto stated full of confidence.</p><p>"<b>How about I put
you to test with that after you feed me then?</b>" The Kyuubi
asked grinning.</p><p>"Whatever...Anyway,
why are you looking at other women here when you told me earlier that
you attacked Konohagakure because someone took away the love of your
life?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"<b>...Oh you
remembered, huh brat? Well that little staement of yours reminded me
what I wanted to talk to you about, brat.</b>" The Kyuubi
replied.</p><p>"Huh? I don't know
who did it, after all I was just a baby back then." Naruto
stated.</p><p>"<b>Ofcourse I wasn't
going to ask you if you knew brat, Unlike you I have a damn good
brain.</b>" The Kyuubi replied.</p><p>"Teh, Yeah right,
dumbass fox." Naruto said, the Kyuubi growling at Naruto in
reply.</p><p>"<b>Anyway, now that
I'm out of my little prison, I...I mean we, could find the person who
killed my love and have my revenge on him. And you can have revenge
on him to for having your home attacked by me...What do you say,
brat?</b>" Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"No way, I'm not
going to be influenced by you so I'm not going to help you with any
revenge." Naruto replied.</p><p>"<b>What if I trained
you for a while and all in return? I know some interesting things
even your sensei most likely won't know.</b>" The Kyuubi replied
grinning.</p><p>Naruto looked at the fox
on his head again and wondered what to do.</p><p>"I can't help you,
fox...I can't leave my village's border without having a mission
order or without Ero-sennin...If I do I become a Nuke-nin, and from
what I've heard from Ero-sennin that life is not very good for you
then." Naruto replied.</p><p>"<b>Hehehe, I
see...Interesting...You know brat, you kind of resemble me around the
time I became was in state of a human's twelve year old...and
training just begun to get more serious for me...</b>" The
Kyuubi chuckled with a wide grin on his face.</p><p>"Huh? Really?...Wait!
That was an insult, wasn't it!" Naruto yelled.</p><p>"<b>You consider
being compared to a 1200 year old demon that would one day rule a
large portion of his world an insult? You humans are really a
mysterie at times...</b>" The Kyuubi said.</p><p>"Wait...It took you
1200 years to become somewhat like me at the age of fifteen?"
Naruto asked confused.</p><p>"<b>No...I was
mentally mature a long time before that, though in the standards of
demons, I was still wet behind the ears at the age of 1200...It's the
age that we Biju get to learn the others and start training in
groups, with us ofcourse being the team's leader.</b>" The
Kyuubi replied.</p><p>"Then what did you
mean by I resemble you around the time you were in a twelve year old
state?" Naruto asked confused.</p><p>"<b>Meaning my body
looked like a twelve year old human back then...and showing the same
kind of loyalty to my nation and to my first friends...</b>" The
Kyuubi stated.</p><p>"First friends?"
Naruto asked.</p><p>"<b>Oh...So you you
are interested in my life aren't you?</b>" Kyuubi grinned widely
after stating his question.</p><p>"...No, I just want
to hear how boring it is compared to mine." Naruto lied and
looked away.</p><p>"<b>Well then let me
tell you then when it started to get somewhat interesting, meaning
when I reached the age of 1200.</b>" Kyuubi said.</p><p>----The Kyuubi's Tale----</p><p><b>The day I became
1200...Finally I'd be able to go out in the world and improve my
capabilities.</b></p><p><b>Ever since my birth
I've been trained by my sensei for this moment, the moment I'd be on
my own and become strong on my own way. Not that my sensei
didn't train me, but he only though me what I needed to know up until
that age.</b></p><p><b>Unfortunately, that
also included rules all the other trouble that came with becoming the
strongest of your land one day. But all the years of
not being allowed to go in to the world weere finally gone on that
day.</b></p><p><b>It was also the day
that I'd meet the three other 'demons' that would be with me from
that day onward and were going to become my guardians one day.</b></p><p><b>When I woke up I
quickly got out of bed and looked outside the window. I raised a smile at
seeing the crimson red sky, the sign that it was my coming of age.</b></p><p><b>Not wanting to waste
more time with just staring outside, I hastily took a shower and put
on my usual red flame patterned kimono. After taking also a
quick look in the mirror to see if my hair was in a shape good enough
to head out, I rushed out of my room.</b></p><p><b>I wanted to go out and
into the world as soon as possible, however that was not the case.</b></p><p>"What's the rush,
Kyuubi-sama?" <b>I heard my sensei call out from behind me,
stopping me in my tracks.</b></p><p>"What is it sensei? I
thought training had came to an end yesterday."<b> I said as I
turned around and smirked at my sensei.</b></p><p>"How foolish, have
you forgotten what I thought you already...From today onward
training..."<b> Sensei started.</b></p><p>"Will only truly
begin, right? I know you told me twelvethousand
sixhundredandseventyeight times..."<b> I grunted in reply.</b></p><p>"Actually, it's
twelvethousand sixhundredandseventynine times, Kyuubi-sama...I might
be old but my memory works better then yours, my apprentice."
<b>Sensei replied smirking.</b></p><p>"Ha, I know that
already you thirteenthousand year old geezer..."<b> I muttered.</b></p><p>"And my hearing
hasn't withered away either, Kyuubi-sama... Anyway I didn't stop to
lecture you."<b> Sensei said as he walked towards me. My sensei grabbed
something wrapped in a dark red cloth from behind his back and
presented it to me.</b></p><p>"What's...this?"<b>
I asked as I grabbed the item out of his hands.</b></p><p>"Something I forged
with my own two hands when you were born..."<b> Sensei said as I
unwrapped the cloth, revealing the hilt of a katana. I took the katana
slightly out and looked at the shining blade of it.</b></p><p>"And as an extra I
used a interesting Blood technique on it. That katana wil weigh a
thousand times more in any other hand then yours."<b> Sensei
said smirking.</b></p><p>"As cunning as usual,
sensei. Though if it weighs a thousand times more in other hands then
mine, didn't you have trouble carrying it here?"<b> I asked, my
sensei letting out a chuckle and grinning widely at me.</b></p><p>"I have more then
just years of wit in this body of mine, young Kyuubi-sama. Though, if
I carried it for like half an hour around I'd probably faint
eventually."<b> My sensei replied and continued laughing.</b></p><p>"Don't forget to come
to your ceremony tonight, Kyuubi-sama...Ow and your guardians will
meet you around noon..."<b> Sensei said as he walked off.</b></p><p>"Thank you for the
katana, sensei."<b> I replied, slightly bowing.</b></p><p>"I'm looking forward
to your performance with it."<b> He said before turning around
the corner.</b></p><p><b>Even though you might
find hearing this a bit odd, but upon receiving the katana I was
excited more then you could possibly ever immagine...Well...most
likely.</b></p><p><b>In my moment of
excitement of receiving the katana as a present, I flared up my
chakra, and ran out the building. Just as I jumped out of
the door, I took out my katana and thrusted forward, letting out a
cry that would make little demons want to crawl back where they came
from.</b></p><p><b>It was then that I was
met with a very scared face and two other shocked faces.</b></p><p>"..."<b> I
silently stared at the face, not sure what to say as I nearly impaled
him with my newly gained katana.</b></p><p>"Looks like
Kyuubi-sama doesn't like you already..." <b>A boy who was the
first to wipe his state of shock of him said smirking.</b></p><p>"Actually this was an
accident as I was too eager to start my katana training...However my
next thrust might be pointed towards someone who thinks he knows who
I like and don't like..." <b>I growled in reply as I swiftly
took my katana away from the boy who I nearly impaled and pointed it
at the boy I was just talking to.</b></p><p><b>I took in his
appearance for a second or two. He had a lock of hair in front of one
of his eyes and the rest of his darkred hair was neatly tied back
into a ponytail. He had a serious look
on his face, it looked like he had already experience in combat as he
had a scar running over his cheek.</b></p><p>"Just starting katana
training? I expected the great Kyuubi-sama to already be a master at
battling with weapons." <b>He replied bluntly, but I paid no
mind to it.</b></p><p>"If I remember
correctly this is private property...Give me one reason not to kill
you for trespassing..."<b> I said as I narrowed my eyes on the
ponytailed boy and pointed my katana at his neck.</b></p><p>"Nice way to get rid
of your team-mates...And no matter who you are, a beginner like you
won't beat a swordsmen like me." <b>He said and without that I
could follow he had drawn out his own katana and pushed mine away
from his neck.</b></p><p>"You three are my
team-mates and future guardians?" <b>I perked an eyebrow at
them, wondering why I get appointed with people who were most likely
just as old as I am.</b></p><p>"Ah! Yes we
are...uhm...sorry for all of this but...ehm..." <b>I averted my
eyes to the girl who had been silently frozen stiff just up untill
then.</b></p><p>"Kenseikan? You're a
noble?" <b>I asked as I noticed the Kenseikan on the side of her
head with a couple of locks of hair running trough it.</b></p><p><b>She had short red hair
that came down to her neck and a porcelain face, which seemd to be
bright even though she was looking moderately worried right then.</b></p><p>"Ah, this...?"
<b>The girl said as she touched her Kenseikan, like she was insecure
about whether they were really there or not, </b>"Hm, Yes I'm a
noble then I guess" <b>She said smiling widely, trying to hide
her nervousness.</b></p><p>"I've never seen you
before at any of the offical festivities...Hm...And what about this
guy?" <b>I asked as I pointed with the scabbard of my katana at
the boy who I nearly impaled.</b></p><p>"Huh? What? AH!
Kyuubi-sama!" <b>The boy yelled and pointed at me, just been
shaken out of whatever he was thinking about before.</b></p><p>"...Yes, the one and
only. So what is your specialty? We have a 'master' swordsmen and a
noblewoman here...Who are you?" <b>I asked.</b></p><p>"Er...I don't
know...No one special as far as I can remember..." <b>He stated
as he scratched his head, trying to come up with a reason why he was
selected to become one of my guardians.</b></p><p><b>I took a closer look at
him, noticing that he also had red hair and spiked up. Other then
that he didn't look like he had anything special about him.</b></p><p>----Back to normal PoV----</p><p>"What! There's a
demon me!" Naruto interupted Kyuubi story telling.</p><p>"<b>What are you
rambling about, brat?</b>" Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"Well he has spikey
hair, like I do...He's in a twelve year old state...Looks like he
isn't able to do anything special, yells for no appearant
reason...Sounds like the old me?" Naruto stated as he counted on
his fingers.</p><p>"<b>Don't you just
mean...you?</b>" Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"NO! I'm not anything
like that anymore!" Naruto yelled.</p><p>"<b>You still
yell...besides that guys hair was all pointing up in a spikey kind of
way. Not like you.</b>" Kyuubi replied and hit Naruto on his
head with his paw.</p><p>"Good, because that
would mean you were making this all up." Naruto muttered. Kyuubi growled and smacked
Naruto again with his paw.</p><p>"<b>Now you got me
out of the mood of telling my interesting life story.</b>"
Kyuubi growled.</p><p>"We're almost home
anyway...Also...What are kense...somethings?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"<b>Kenseikan...They
are hairdecorations worn by nobles in the demon world...Me, the other
Biju and our families are the only ones that need not to specifically
wear them, since everyone knows we're nobles already.</b>"
Kyuubi explained.</p><p>"Ah...I see...I
understand it...I think." Naruto nodded a couple of times.</p><p>"Oi, Why are they all
redheads by the way?" Naruto asked.</p><p>"<b>Red, darkred,
darkorange...In my land most of the demons were either kitsune's or
canine, meaning they adapted their hair colors as well.</b>"
Kyuubi replied.</p><p>"Oh...I never knew
that...Anyway we're at my home now so...let's get you something to
eat or something. Maybe after that you can tell me more...I want to
know what kind of missions demons go on." Naruto said nodding as
he opened the door to his apartment.</p><p>"<b>Yeah, yeah,
yeah...we're a long way from missions still brat, so just get me
something to eat already.</b>" Kyuubi muttered as he jumped of
Naruto's head and walked trough Naruto's apartment, settling on his
bed.</p><p>Naruto grunted in reply as
he closed the door and slipped out of his shoes.</p><p>"<b>Hehehe...But I
was right after all, wasn't I?</b>" Kyuubi asked grinning widely
while softly chuckling.</p><p>"Right with what?"
Naruto asked as he opened his fridge.</p><p>"<b>You want to know
what happened in my life.</b>" Kyuubi grinned even wider.</p><p>"...Not if you're
going to tell me about every year." Naruto muttered as he took
out some instant ramen and closed his fridge again.</p><p>"<b>I heard that
brat...And no I won't, the most interesting stuff happened only
happened once every while...not every year.</b>" Kyuubi stated
as he glared at Naruto's back.</p><p>"Alright, then after
atleast three minutes and a lot of ramen bowl's later, you can tell
me what happens next." Naruto replied grinning widely.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>A/N:
Well, the next chapter might take a while tho it will have some of the
orignal Naruto-style humor (well dunno if it's orignal but you get what
I mean right XP?) If you want to know what Kenseikan look like, google
for Kuchiki Byakuya from the anime Bleach and look at what he's wearing
on and at the side of his head. Looks pretty damn cool on some people,
I think. Also just to note, this might eventually have Naruto leave
Konoha 'temporarily' to help out Kyuubi with his revenge and all. Next
chapter will have some fun stuff with Kyuubi and we'll get to know the
names of his future guardians and ofcourse his ceremony. Please review
again, I'll continue writing anyway but comments are welcome since it
might change certain things eventaully in this fic :) Till next time!</p>
