I won't upload this fic too much until its plot is cemented. I don't want to have to redo this story all over again. It's going to be much different from the first version of Sanity, a lot darker for one. I'd really love some feedback on this fic.

It binds people together using their heartaches as a medium, but the loss you feel, even with so many loved ones surrounding you, is indescribable. It can even be unbearable in most cases. It could confuse your senses and make you lose your sanity. When you lose a precious person, someone you love, it can lead you to do crazy things. Things you would never do if you had your normal mindset. Like making a deal with the Devil himself…</i></p><p><i>When we lost him that day, I didn't think that we'd be able to go on.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>Chapter 1</u></b><br><b><u>Of Fear & Death</u></b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>The day commenced just as any ordinary Saturday would. We had planned to meet up at the mall at around one in the afternoon and go shopping before grabbing a bite to eat in the food court (probably some burgers at Barby's). We were going to see a movie at the movie complex located in the vicinity of downtown. All in all, we should have been at our respective homes by seven or eight at night. We only got as far as the movie part…</i></p><p>It was an icy cold winter day. The sun was concealed by the dark, foreboding clouds in the sky. The snowfall was light for the meantime, but the weather forecast predicted that there would be a blizzard blowing in during the course of the late night and lapping over into the morn of the next day. The snow from previous days was mounded into piles ranging in size from small to large. The pavements and roads located in the immediate region surrounding the elephantine mall were cleared for the convenience of prospective shoppers. The mall was a large building bearing a consistent, gilded hue. Despite being built many years ago, it was still a magnificent edifice.</p><p>The arctic winds blew sporadically outside, but inside was warm and inviting. Crowds of people roamed throughout its upper and lower levels, some simply observing a store's contents through the display window while others chose to enter the store and see if there was anything worth purchasing.</p><p>The food court was jam-packed. Finding a vacant seat there was probably harder than locating the proverbial needle in the haystack.</p><p>Three teenagers were fortunate enough to have found a table. One of them was a tanned boy sporting a brilliant smile that seemed to be imprinted on his face. Playful cerulean eyes shone beneath his bright orange hood, constantly flickering between the other boy and the girl. His tanned face was smooth and handsome; not a scar marred it. The other boy had dark hair with a bluish tinge fashioned in a peculiar way and matching onyx eyes. His skin color was naturally pallor, sharply contrasting with his midnight-colored winter coat. Unlike his tanned counterpart, a nonchalant expression seemed etched to his face. The rosette bore a happy expression similar to that of the blue-eyed boy's own. Emerald green eyes sparkled with mirth as she took a sip of her soda, intently listening to what the boy dressed in the orange coat was saying. Her luscious, cherry pink lips split into a grin as the azure-eyed boy made some suggestive movements with his hands, a wide smile still playing on his lips. The dark-haired boy struggled to keep his face passive, but a tiny smirk still formed despite himself.</p><p>The blue-eyed boy finally removed his hood, revealing a shock of dark hair. "Damn… It's really warm in here."</p><p>"At least it's not cold," the rosette quickly countered. "You would think that they could have already fixed the furnace in school by now."</p><p>"You have a point, Sakura." He took another bite of his sandwich. "I believe that it's Sasuke's turn to pick the movie this time, right?" The raven simply snorted and took a sip of his water.</p><p>"Oh come now, Sasuke," Sakura huffed. "Don't be so boring."</p><p>He simply rolled his eyes at their persistence before ceding to their pleas and saying, "Fine. Let's see 'Mr. Bopper's Penguins'." They both raised their eyebrows at this. To say that Sasuke was a comedian was a huge understatement. He was one of the most introverted and rather pessimistic persons they've ever known. Nonetheless, the both loved him for it. It was his attitude that made him Sasuke.</p><p>"Are you serious?" The other dark-haired boy finished off his burger, letting out a large belch of satisfaction.</p><p>"Must you be so rude, Naruto?"</p><p>"Yes, I am serious, idiot." Sasuke knowingly cut Sakura off, causing her to pout in vexation. "You've wanted to see that movie since you first heard of it. Quite honestly, I want to know what's with all the hullabaloo about Lou Louis."</p><p>"Are you serious?" Naruto repeated his previous question. "Lou Louis is one of the funniest people alive!" He pounded his fist on their table to emphasize his point. "The dude's like my hero." The raven simply rolled his eyes and huffed, slumping down further into his chair. He had been told numerous times by his brother that it would have a negative effect on his posture, but he couldn't care less. This was the way he was most comfortable sitting.</p><p>"I'll check the bus schedule, then." The rosette opened her handbag and pulled out a small, rectangular pamphlet. The number "6" was printed in bold green on the front, a rudimentary outline of the bus route printed in a lighter shade of green beneath in. She opened it up, emerald green eyes scanning the times printed. Her pink eyebrows knitted in concentration. Hastily, she whipped out her iPhone to check the time and compared it to those on the pamphlet.</p><p>"So what time should we hit the road?" Naruto asked, running a tanned hand through his ebony bangs.</p><p>"We can leave now. There's a bus headed for downtown in ten minutes." The trio stood up and maneuvered their way out of the crowded court. Sakura and Naruto idly chatted about random topics, some school related, while Sasuke quietly slipped his headphones on. The other two didn't mind his passivity; they were used to it from long before.</p><p>"He made a really cute baby," Naruto commented offhandedly but loudly at the same time, fully well knowing that the other raven would not hear him. Sakura chuckled at his statement, briefly glancing at Sasuke before turning back to Naruto.</p><p>"You did too," she teased, elbowing him in the ribs and making him flinch slightly.</p><p>They walked side-by-side down the tiled walkway in perfect synchronization with each other. The dense mass of people was considerably less on the upper level of the mall, making it much easier to amble along and relax. Naruto walked between the two, hands in his pockets and his orange hood back on his head once again, concealing his dark locks. The rosette mimicked the blue-eyed boy and pulled her own hood over her head, enjoying the warmth she was receiving. It was freezing outside, might as well savor the heat now. Naruto gently nudged Sasuke's arm, indicating his covered head, hoping that the raven would comprehend his message; he did.</p><p>They had a few minutes to spare before the bus to downtown was to arrive, so they spent it behind the large glass doors at the mall's entrance, not willing to risk freezing outside any longer than necessary. Several others stood with them, either awaiting the same bus or a different one. The bus finally rounded the curb, passengers waiting to enter the mall in tow. They weren't entirely sure if to run to the bus stop because they hadn't seen its number yet. The bus steadily advanced closer and closer until the snowfall no longer obscured their view. "6A Downtown", it read, that was all they needed to see before they dashed out the mall and to the stop with several others in pursuit.</p><p>It was a half hour ride to downtown in the warm, partially filled bus. It was fairly unproductive as well. Sasuke and Sakura sat together, the ebony-haired boy listening to his music and staring languidly out the window while the emerald-eyed girl leaned against him, texting away on her phone presumably to her friend, Ino. Those two were practically sisters. The only thing blocking that full-fledged kinship was that they were not related by blood. Once upon a time, during their lives in middle school, those two were fierce rivals competing for Sasuke's love, the same Sasuke she was currently leaning against. While you may assume by this that Sakura had won, but that was not the case. That, of course, is a horse of a different color. It was done and over with now, that's all that mattered. Their friendship could not be stronger.</p><p>Naruto, on the other hand, sat with a peculiar, redhead fellow, despite the fact that there were still several unoccupied seats. Long, ruby red locks flowed midway down his back, curling gently and curving inwards at the ends. Naruto could see from his side portfolio that his eye color was an unusual but breath-taking shade of amber. He sat cross-legged, concentrating deeply on the book resting on his lap. Not being a big fan of books, he chose instead to assess the person, hoping to make a new friend by the end of this ride. The azure-eyed boy never expected to use this expression. He had heard Sakura use it to describe Sasuke a short while back and he could never forget it. No matter how hard he tried… That term was "bedroom eyes". Naruto didn't think that there was anything wrong in the way he was describing this man. He was only a sophomore in high school, a mere fifteen-year-old. He wasn't well educated in the area of romance, much less sex. Bearing the innocence of a child at mind and at heart was a virtue that only Naruto seemed to possess at such an impressionable age.</p><p>The redhead glanced briefly in Naruto's direction. One look at that big, goofy grin had him hooked.</p><p>"Hi!" Naruto chirped, happy to finally catch the handsome man's attention.</p><p>"Hello," he replied in a much more reserved tone of voice, not once glancing at the novel in his lap.</p><p>"My name is Naruto. What's yours?"</p><p>"My name is Kyuubi. It's a pleasure to meet you." He raised a pallor hand in hopes of a handshake. Naruto's hand was quite soft, almost like a girl's. He had expected the teenage boy's hand to be much more calloused.</p><p>"It's great to meet you too!" His grin grew impossibly wider. "So, what brings you to this dinky town?"</p><p>"Me? I'm just travelling around for now," he replied honestly. "And yourself?"</p><p>"I was born here," Naruto huffed, a pout quickly forming and disappearing with the same velocity. He had never met a traveller before. Maybe this man would have some interesting adventures he'd like to share. While the blue-eyed boy didn't want to impose on the stranger, he seemed willing enough to converse with. "What's life like out there? I've always wanted to travel myself, but I'm honestly a bit nervous. I've never left home before." Naruto didn't look away from the redhead even though he felt his cheeks heat up. It was just part of his nature to maintain eye contact during a conversation.</p><p>"I have to admit that I, myself, was scared when I first started travelling as well," Kyuubi said with a chuckle. "It really isn't that bad. It's actually quite fun. You get to see magnificent sites that you've never seen before, up close. For instance, the Coliseum in Rome –"</p><p>"- whoa! You've been to Rome?" Naruto interrupted a bit loudly and unabashedly. When something interested him, he always let it be known.</p><p>"Why, yes, I have." He smiled at the young boy's brash demeanor. "If you'd like, I could tell you a story about the place."</p><p>"Oh, yes! I'd love that!" Naruto and Kyuubi chatted for the remainder of the trip. Well, it was more along the lines of Kyuubi entertaining Naruto with his "adventures" in foreign countries and different states in the U.S. Of course, Naruto had never been so interested in a conversation in his life. It had been his dream to travel all over the world, like this man had. Now, after hearing these fascinating tales, that life enticed him more than ever. The dark-haired boy had never been so excited in his life, about anything. The ebullience he felt while speaking with this man was so surreal… He just had to get to know him better.</p><p>"Do you have a cellphone?" Naruto blurted out as soon as Kyuubi finished another one of his stories. "I'd like to call you. Maybe we can meet up again some time." Kyuubi paused for a moment, not entirely sure how to respond.</p><p>"You know what, Naruto? I'd actually enjoy that a lot." The redhead graced him with a small smile. They exchanged phone numbers. "I believe this is my stop." Naruto stood up and allowed the man to leave. Just before the back exit of the bus opened, he looked directly at Naruto and said, "Since I am older, it would be much more appropriate for me to call you. If you don't mind, that is."</p><p>"Of course not! I'm looking forward to it!" Kyuubi gave him one last smile before briskly walking off the bus. As the bus driver began to pull away from the curb, Naruto couldn't help but look at the man as they left. His gait was so graceful and elegant; it was almost as if he were looking at someone descending from a royal bloodline. The only other people he saw sporting a similar gait were those of the Uchiha family, of Sasuke's family. Namely Sasuke and his brother, Itachi. Now, however, was not the time to admire Kyuubi's or Sasuke's gait. Their stop was only three stops away from Kyuubi's, not that he was counting or anything.</p><p>When they got off, he heard Sakura tease, "Your boyfriend is really cute."</p><p>"Ah! He's not my boyfriend, Sakura!" At this both Sasuke and Sakura chuckled, causing him to pout. They really enjoyed pushing his buttons. Ever since they were young it had been one of their favorite pastimes.</p><p>Naruto glanced to the right and instantly noticed the beveled windows of the grandeur church house. Had it been larger it would have definitely passed as a cathedral. He wasn't a religious fanatic or anything like that, but he was always impressed by the architectural design of places of worship. Naruto was tempted to go inside and check out the place, see what the interior décor was like, but quickly changed his mind. Not only did they have a movie to see, but he found that it would be quite disrespectful to violate such a holy sanctuary for his own selfish wants. Plus the priest and parishioners wouldn't like it very much if he intruded in on their church for those said wants.</p><p>The movie multiplex was a mere three blocks away. They could make it there with plenty of time to spare. Naruto had checked the times "Mr. Bopper's Penguins" was playing in cinemas earlier today in case they were getting to view it. He honestly hadn't expected Sasuke to choose it, but that didn't mean that he wasn't elated that he did. If he remembered correctly, one of the show times was at half past four. They had a whole half hour to wait. That was the perfect amount of time.</p><p>He fell into step with his two best friends once again. Sasuke had removed his headphones a while ago, now getting into a passionate (at least it was for Naruto) conversation concerning Lou Louis. Sakura laughed every time Naruto mimicked the actor in a desperate attempt to get Sasuke to adore him as well.</p><p>"I suppose I'll know if I like him when I see this movie," the Uchiha retorted, reaching over Sakura's head to pinch Naruto's tanned cheek.</p><p>"Ouch, you bastard! For the record, I like my face." He muttered something incoherent, causing the other two to laugh once again. It was always nice to be reminded that he had such a positive effect on them.</p><p>They dusted off the snowflakes that managed to collect on their coats before removing them completely. The movie theatre was pleasantly warm, so they found no need for them at the moment. Sasuke walked off to purchase the tickets as they had planned beforehand. At first they had insisted on paying for their own tickets, but Sasuke simply dismissed their futile protests with a snort, effectively silencing them both. To say Naruto was annoyed by Sasuke for that was an understatement. He knew the guy was loaded, but he didn't have to flaunt it like that. It always made him so uncomfortable. Naruto knew that Sasuke meant well by it, merely performing the deed out of sheer kindness, but still…</p><p>They rarely bought snacks at the concession stand, finding it much more convenient and a great deal less expensive to sneak in their own snacks using Sakura's large handbag. Hey, it was wrong, but it sure beat the highway robbery taking place in this very cinema. Who paid $5 for a small bag of popcorn? And one without butter nonetheless.</p><p>When Sasuke came back with the tickets they immediately headed over to the usher. The man checked their tickets – that bored expression never leaving his face – before he pointed in the direction of their theatre and muttered a half-hearted, "Enjoy the movie." They did not allow his glum attitude to dampen their spirits though. The trio was going to see a comedy. What good would having a sour mood do for them?</p><p>After the movie, Naruto rambled animatedly about Lou Louis and the "adorable" penguins. For once, Sasuke did not question the other boy's crazy obsession with the man. He had to admit, that man had some serious talent in the field of acting. The raven had never had someone make him laugh in the way… In the way Naruto made him laugh.</p><p>"If you thought that was good, then you'll love 'The Table Guy'. That one's incredible," he chirped, holding the glass door open for his two friends and bowing in a courteous manner.</p><p>"Such a gentleman," Sakura cooed.</p><p>"It's my pleasure to assist such a lovely lady and her man," he chuckled, earning himself a half-hearted glare from Sasuke and a light blush from Sakura. "I should probably be headed home soon," Naruto continued, much to their dismay. "I promised Dad that I'd be home in time for dinner." He glanced at the rosette. "Do you want me to walk you home?"</p><p>"No, thank you," she courteously declined. "I'm meeting up with Ino at her father's flower shop."</p><p>"What about you?" He turned to his head in Sasuke's direction. "Want me to walk you home, princess?" Naruto burst out laughing when he saw the raven's face drop.</p><p>"No, idiot. Besides, my brother's taking me to some wine tasting event."</p><p>"Oh, fun," Naruto mocked, knowing fully well how much Sasuke detested those high-profile events. Being surrounded by a bunch of rich snobs who felt that they were worth more than everyone else was one of the most aggravating experiences the Uchiha boy had to live through. It was only because his brother, Itachi, forced him to go with him that he was even seen at such places. Furthermore, Itachi only went because their father made them go. They couldn't disobey him, lest they wanted to shame their family name. Oh the splendors of being born into a wealthy family.</p><p>Sometimes (and the only person Sasuke ever admitted this to was Naruto) he wished that his family could have been like the typical middle-class family. At least then they would have been much happier and maybe a great deal more satisfied with their livelihoods.</p><p>"Tell Itachi I said 'hi', okay?</p><p>"Sure. You should come over some time." He paused. "Itachi's really fond of you and so is my mom. Dad… Well, you know how he is."</p><p>"Yeah, he passed down the 'stick-up-the-butt' gene to you and Itachi." Sakura giggled at his statement and a dark eyebrow twitched. Honestly, sometimes he felt that Naruto's sole desire was to see what he could make a joke out of. Sasuke was very fond of Naruto's jovial personality and so was two-thirds (Itachi and his mother) of his family, but he sometimes wished that Naruto could behave more seriously at times.</p><p>"Oh lighten up," Sakura chided, punching Sasuke's arm lightly. "We're just having some fun."</p><p>"Yes, at my expense."</p><p>"Ha ha. Rich joke."</p><p><i><b>Thwap!</b></i></p><p>"Ouch! You bastard, Sasuke!" the blond boy whined, pulling his orange hood over his head again.</p><p>"You know you were <b>begging </b>for that one."</p><p>"Can you guys ever <b>not </b>fight?"</p><p>"Nope," Naruto replied truthfully. "It's how we bond, just like how you bond with Ino through shopping and shoes and makeup and what not. It's a guy thing."</p><p>"Oh, well excuse me." Sakura stuck her pale nose in the air in mock disgust. Naruto made a face at her and moved to stick a finger up her nose. "Ah! Do you want <b>me </b>to hit you now?" she barked, scampering behind the other boy, who simply rolled his eyes at Naruto's foolish antics.</p><p><i>It didn't take very long for our day to make a complete one-eighty from there… We spotted one of teachers, Miss Kurenai, walking down the opposite side of the street. She's one of the prettiest women I've ever seen. She must have been going on a date (probably with Mister Asuma) because she was dressed gorgeously. A knee-length, aureate, (fake) fur coat covered her slight frame and whatever gown she wore beneath it. Pressed against the side of her coat was that cherry red purse that got the ball rolling.</i></p><p>"What's up, Miss?" Naruto called, waving animatedly to his teacher.</p><p>"Hello, Naruto! Hello, you guys! I hope you've done your homework!"</p><p>"Oh, Miss Kurenai! You're so funny!" Naruto laughed. The dark-haired woman simply shook her head, obviously expecting that kind of answer from Naruto. Still, it wasn't like any of them were bad students.</p><p>They were about to say their farewells and be on their respective ways. A muscular man wearing a ski-mask jumped out of the alleyway Kurenai had just passed. He latched on to her purse and violently ripped it from her grasp. The velocity of the sudden attack knocked the teacher backwards and she landed on her rear end with a pained, "Oof!"</p><p>"No! Someone help, please!" she cried helplessly as she watched her attacker escape. "He's stolen my purse!"</p><p>"I got you, Miss!" Naruto shouted as he dashed past her and after the thief. "Sasuke, Sakura, help Miss Kurenai!" A moment later a pale hand pressed gently against the back of her fur coat.</p><p>"Are you okay?" Sakura asked tentatively. Unlike Sakura, Sasuke stood before their teacher, hands outstretched, preparing to help her to her feet.</p><p>Naruto chased the large man down endless streets and made sharp turns at endless corners, nearly slipping on sheets of ice several times. He would get back Miss Kurenai's purse no matter what. He would force this lowlife criminal to surrender one way or another.</p><p>A familiar site caught his attention as they ran; they were approaching the church he had seen earlier. His heart and pulse rates accelerated and respiration did not come easy at this point because of the speed he was running at. Even as his legs burned from the deprivation of oxygen, he did not stop. He was much too hell-bent on catching this bandit.</p><p>For a split moment, he slowed, a foreboding feeling washing over his senses. What if this man was armed? Shouldn't the police handle this? This was really dangerous. However, that moment of hesitation was pushed aside for another rush of adrenaline and speed as soon as the man ran into the alleyway adjacent to the church.</p><p>Naruto rounded the corner into the alleyway and halted. His blue eyes widened and he blanched with fright. In that large hand was a piece of weaponry that Naruto could recognize anywhere. He shivered involuntarily when the man pulled back the hammer of the gun. The boy ran a timorous hand through his dark hair – his hood being knocked back by the wind's velocity as he ran at such high speeds – subconsciously observing – despite his detrimental situation – that the snowfall had considerably increased.</p><p>"Sorry, kid, but I'm not sparing you today." His voice was baritone and coarse, but it was its seriousness that made Naruto cringe. The boy tried to back away, only to find that fear had immobilized him. Terrified blue eyes locked with the thief's gleeful yet psychotic own just as he pulled the trigger.</p><p>A gunshot resounded throughout the vicinity, sending the citizens located in the surrounding area into a frenzied panic.</p><p>"Sasuke!" Sakura cried in panic as she came to a halt, grasping the necklace that Naruto had given to her on her twelfth birthday. She was fifteen now. It was a slim, leaf green crystal. By no means was it a spectacular jewel, but its charm laid in its simplicity. When she asked about how he obtained it, he told her that he won it in a bet against their middle school principal, Tsunade. Naruto had vehemently refused to disclose the details of their bet, much to her displeasure, but she respected his decision anyway. She had then asked why he was giving such a prized possession to her; his answer shocked her.</p><p><i>"</i><i><u>Grandma Tsunade told me to give this to someone I held dear to me. That's you, Sakura.</u></i><i>" </i>What surprised her even more was that he dared to call their principal "grandma".</p><p>"What's wrong?" Sasuke asked. He didn't want to stop now. After hearing that thunderous boom, he desperately wanted to get to the source, praying that he wouldn't find Naruto there.</p><p>"The necklace that Naruto gave me… It just cracked!" Emerald green eyes stared in horror at the single break running straight down the center. The gem reflected her solicitous gaze. "Sasuke, is he…?" Sasuke was transfixed at the sight of the cracked necklace and the pained look on the rosette's face.</p><p>It took him several moments to regain his composure before he bolted down the streets. The dark-haired teen shielded his eyes from the falling snow and the velocity of the wind. It almost seemed to be snowing harder even though it wasn't supposed to accelerate until late night. It was falling like… Like rain. That was not a good omen. It never was.</p><p>Sakura was hot on his trail, the necklace clutched tightly against her chest. Tears cascaded down her face even though she didn't know Naruto's fate as of yet. The necklace cracked though; that could not be a good sign, not in the least.</p><p>Sasuke was running so fast that he nearly missed the horrific scene in the alleyway beside the church. The shot came from somewhere within this region, he now wished that he never found it. His feet practically led him in this direction. He wasn't thinking of where he was going. All he wanted to do was find the source of the sound. But now… He took a few steps forward before collapsing right into the sloshy ground, several feet from his best friend's corpse. He rolled unto his back and pulled at his hair, almost as if his intention was to uproot it. The agonizing cry that reverberated from said alleyway sent Sakura crashing to her knees, loud, bitter sobs flowing freely and uncontrollably from her pink lips. It was a truly pitiful sight to behold, two teenagers suffering a mental and emotional breakdown due to the tragic loss of a friend.</p><p>"God, please help me!" Sasuke managed to crawl his way over to Naruto and set his head in his lap. "Please, let him live!" He clutched Naruto's bloodied coat as if it were some sort of lifeline, uncaring of the warm blood staining his hands. Sakura managed to stumble her way into the alleyway before collapsing right next to Sasuke, her cries increasing tenfold.</p><p>A trembling, slender hand found its way atop Sasuke's as she forced her labored breathing to calm. "We've got to call the police." She stuttered terribly, the weight of the situation proving to be too much for her fragile psyche.</p><p>The snowfall began to slow.</p><p>"There's no need." That rich, velvety voice was strangely familiar. "He's not dead… Yet." At this point, however, they couldn't care less about who it was. Both teens' heads shot up, hoping to find the source of the voice.</p><p>"God?" Sasuke murmured, feeling a bit silly for doing so immediately after. The deep voice chuckled.</p><p>"No, my boy. I'm just here to help him." The red-haired man from the bus appeared before them practically out of nowhere, his index finger pointed directly at the boy they were both sobbing so bitterly over. "Of course, saving his life will come at a price. Since he can longer speak for himself, it's up to you two to make this decision for him." A wide smirk grew on his lips, his pearly white fangs exposed.</p><p>"What do you want?" Sasuke growled hastily. Naruto could die at any moment, then this man's promise would be all for naught.</p><p>"That he will belong to me for eternity."</p><p>"We can't promise that!" Sakura cried. "It's not our choice to make!"</p><p>"I'm sorry, but do you want him to be saved, or are you going to whine until he dies?" They both quieted. Kyuubi quirked an eyebrow at this. They were taking an awfully long time with making a decision. If they cared so much about this child, then they would have already said –</p><p>"Yes…" Onyx eyes locked with crimson ones, causing an involuntary spasm to wrack the boy's body. "Do whatever it is you please, but just save him." It was selfish of him, and it was selfish of Sakura for not intervening to stop this from occurring, but they loved him too much. They just couldn't let him go.</p><p>That smirk grew impossibly wider.</p><p>"Back up, then, and give me space to work." They immediately scampered back, reluctantly releasing the dying boy from their grasp. The man approached him and knelt before him, gently caressing his cheek. For a few moments, the redhead did nothing, leaving Sasuke and Sakura in a dreadful state of anticipation.</p><p>He bared his fangs.</p><p>Sakura gasped and looked at her friend. "Sasuke, is he a… A -"</p><p>"- vampire, my dear? Why, yes I am," he chuckled in that smooth voice. "You want me to save him, right? This is the only way I can."</p><p>"Then by eternity, he really meant it," Sasuke murmured to himself, looking down at his bloodied hands. They two teens felt very cold at the moment, not because of the snow, or the wind, or the slosh on the ground they were currently sitting in. It was because the felt as though they betrayed Naruto by taking his choice away. Would he really want this, or would he want them to let him rest in peace?</p><p>Kyuubi picked Naruto's upper body up slightly and began nuzzling his neck. It was so affectionate and misleading. They almost missed those fangs sinking into his body because they were so entranced by the vampire's eccentric display of affection. Neither dared to breathe as their friend and the vampire stayed locked in that position in fear of somehow interrupting this "life-saving" process. The redhead brought his claws up to either side of his cheeks. In one fluid swipe, they were intertwined neatly behind the smaller boy's back. The pallor, piano fingers began to trace soothing circles on the small of his back, blood spurting out from the cuts on his cheeks.</p><p>"You bastard!" Sasuke sneered, still not daring to approach the pair. "What do you think you're doing?"</p><p>Kyuubi slowly retracted his fangs from the tanned neck, promptly placing a chaste kiss on Naruto's lips. He maneuvered the younger boy so the he was leaning against him, all the while giving his friends a clear shot of his now scarred face.</p><p>"I've marked him as mine." A sadistic grin formed on his lips, those red eyes alit with an unbidden excitement. "I suggest you refrain from embracing him, lest you want to become his 'first' meal."</p><p><i>We honestly didn't know what we were doing at the time, even so, I didn't regret it, and neither did Sasuke.</i></p><p>They watched in morbid fascination as Naruto's black hair began to change color, growing lighter and lighter until it was nearly white. The color suited him perfectly, was Sakura's fleeting thought at the moment. That light shade of blond looked remarkably stunning on him.</p><p>Kyuubi massaged his shoulders, awaiting the grand finale of his transformation. "Wake up now, Naruto," he purred seductively, uncaring of the two teenagers presence. All that mattered to him now was the blond boy in his possession. The three scars marring his once clear face healed at a rapid rate, darkening and emboldening themselves, gaining the guise of whiskers.</p><p><i>It unnerved us at first when the realization finally dawned upon us that the Naruto we knew would never be returning, that this was going to be most likely be an entirely new person. However, we were still relieved and excited to have him walking among us once again. It's hard to let go of someone you deeply care for. Someone who has always been such a precious friend… Naruto told us both something a long time ago, something neither I nor Sasuke has ever forgotten.</i></p><p>Slowly, Naruto's eyes opened until they were half-mast, blood red eyes reflecting the faces of his two closest friends.</p><p><i>Where one adventure ends, another one begins. This was going to be one hell of an adventure, for all of us.</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;"><b><u>©Extreme Kiwi 2011</u></b></p>
