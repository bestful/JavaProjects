One villagers held his hands above his head. Two held his lags down, to stop him from getting away.</p><p>"No, Stop it!" Naruto cried. "Let me go" Naruto began to struggle to get loose. One of the villagers began to remove his clothing. Naruto tried to fight him off.</p><p>"If you hold still, this will be a lot eraser on you." One of the villagers whispered in Naruto ear.</p><p>When none of the villagers were looking, Naruto used one of his three tails to grabbed a stick. Then he hit all four villagers with the stick. The villagers let him go, he made a run for it. Naruto ran into The Forest of Death. When he thought it was clear he transformed into a three tailed fox.</p><p>Naruto had blond furry with white furry at the tip of his tail and ears. Naruto ran a little feather into the forest. To his hiding spot, which was a hole under a tree. He would hide here when the villagers would attack him.</p><p><b>Kyuubi</b></p><p>Kyuubi walked through The Forest of Death. He had not be to Konoda Village in years. He was going to go see the Uchiha and the Hyuugo clan. There Clans have been friends for years. Kyuubi kept walking, until he seen a blond fox walk by. The blond fox was in heat, and was giving off a sweet smell of vanilla and chocolate. Kyuubi followed the blond fox, until it went into a hole.</p><p>'<i>The little fox smells so good' </i>Kyuubi thought.</p><p>"I want the little blond fox" Kyuubi muttered, turned into his fox form. His fox form was red fur with black tip tail and ears. He made his way over to the hole in the tree.</p><p><b>Naruto</b></p><p>Naruto was laying on his grass bed cleaning his cuts, when he heard someone coming. Naruto jumping on all four.</p><p>'<i>This is not my day'</i> Naruto told himself. He was in heat and was being attacked by everyone and it was only his first day of heat. He hated the summer he was in pain, everyone attacked him. What made things worse for Naruto, was that he looked fourteen even though he was eighteen. Naruto was short for his age, had a baby face which was girly as well as his body.</p><p><b>Kyuubi</b></p><p>Kyuubi made his way down the hole. Where he found a little blond fox cleaning it cuts.</p><p>'<i>It must have been in a fight or, running away from someone'</i> Kyuubi thought.</p><p>'<i>What if someone was trying to mate with him before me? I'm not going to let that happen.' </i>The little fox was ready for any attacks.</p><p><b>Naruto </b></p><p>'<i>I never seen a fox with nine tails before. The only foxes I do see, they normally have three or five' </i>Naruto choked.</p><p>'<i>What if he wants to mate with me, no not again, I don't want to mate or be a one night thing. I know I will use my full strength.' </i>Naruto told himself, Naruto started to revile another three tails.</p><p><b>Kyuubi</b></p><p>Kyuubi stared at the little blond fox when he started to grow three new tails.</p><p>'<i>He is stronger, then he appears' </i>Kyuubi smiled and began to jump around.</p><p>'<i>He is stronger than the foxes in my village' </i>the little blond fox tried to seek past him while he was in his own world. Kyuubi come to; when he seen the blond fox run past him. Kyuubi ran after him, the little blond fox was fast.</p><p>The little blond fox stopped, his three tails disappeared only showing three again. There was three other demons with them know. There was a yellow lion, black wolf, and a dark-blue leopard. Kyuubi looked back at the little blond fox, it three tails were between its lag.</p><p>'<i>These most me the three that attacked him earlier. They must want him' </i>Kyuubi thought.</p><p>"So this is where you ran off to Naruto" the leopard spoke.</p><p>'<i>Naruto is his name, how cute' </i>Kyuubi jumped around.</p><p>"Who is your little friend Naruto?" the wolf asked.</p><p>"I bet we are more fun than he is" the lion smirked.</p><p>"Come on we will make you feel good" the leopard joked.</p><p>"No! You are here to help me find him" the wolf yelled.</p><p>"But, we want a reword for helping" the lion whined.</p><p>"I will reword you in the end, but Naruto is mine in the end" the wolf growled. "Naruto come and be my mate I will protect you." The three of them began to move towards Naruto.</p><p>"No, go away I don't want to mate with you or anyone else" Naruto hissed at them.</p><p>"Naruto either be my mate by choose or force" the wolf worried him.</p><p>"NO!" is all Naruto got to say before Kyuubi was over him. Naruto had forgotten he was there.</p><p>"You're out of luck; he my mate" Kyuubi hissed in warning. Naruto jumped around to face him.</p><p>"I'm not your mate either, I don't even know you" Naruto pointed out. Without warning the wolf ran towards Naruto, to grab him in his mouth like he was a baby fox. The one bad thing Naruto is the size of a baby fox even thaw he is eighteen. Kyuubi grabs Naruto by the neck as if he was a baby kit. "Let me go you ass hole." Naruto piped, trying to claw Kyuubi.</p><p>"Be quiet" Kyuubi warned Naruto. The wolf attacked Kyuubi, snapping and biting at him. Kyuubi made shore Naruto was not getting hurt, he could tell Naruto was scared. Naruto was trembling because he was afraid. The lion and the leopard joined into the fight. Kyuubi dogged every attack thrown at him.</p><p>The lion had bit Naruto on the lag by accident. Naruto gave out a loud yelp of pain and began to cry. They all stopped fighting and stood still. Kyuubi placed Naruto on the ground. Naruto began to limp away, and laid up against a tree. He began to yelp again, it sound like he was calling his parents for help. Kyuubi spotted blood where the lion had bit Naruto.</p><p>Kyuubi became angry at what had happened to Naruto. His true power began to show. Kyuubi attacked the lion, bring him down with one blow. Kyuubi looked over towards the leopard, with eyes as red as can be. The leopard ran away with his tail between his lags. Kyuubi looked over to the wolf, to see him walking over to Naruto. Kyuubi attacked the wolf, they fought for several min. Before the wolf was thrown across the ground.</p><p>"This not over, I will have Naruto as my mate." The wolf warned him, before running off. Kyuubi walked over to Naruto, and looked down at him.</p><p>"Go away! I don't want to be your mate!" Naruto yelled, trying to runaway Naruto barely made it anywhere before falling. Naruto tried to stand up, but failed.</p><p>"I don't think you have a choose in the mater." Kyuubi declared, turning into his human form. Naruto stared at Kyuubi he had never seen someone that handsome before. Kyuubi had red hair and eyes as red as blood. Naruto had never seen eyes like this before, he felt like he was being sucked into his eyes. Kyuubi walked over to Naruto picked him up gentle with out hurting him, and placed him in his arms. Kyuubi smiled, pulling something out of his pocket and placed it around Naruto neck.</p><p>"WHAT THE HELL! Is this a collar?" Naruto yelled trying to pull it off.</p><p>"Yes, it so people know you belong to me. And so you don't turn into your human form. I think you be to hard handle in your human form, and this way it is easer to carry you around. And only I can take it off of you, and if some one tries they get shocked." Kyuubi smiled, walking on to the village.</p><p>Naruto fought to get away, but couldn't get away. Naruto bit and clawed him to let him go. I didn't work because; he would get smacked on the butt and flicked in the nose. Naruto had finally given up after awhile, and started to relax in Kyuubi's arms. Naruto hurt to munch to fight anymore. He was covered in cuts, bruises, and bit marks. Now his butt and nose stung from the smacks and flicks.</p><p>When they arrived in the village people stared at them. Naruto curled into a ball to hide himself in Kyuubi's arms. Kyuubi could tell that Naruto didn't want to be here. A random villager had walked up to Kyuubi, and snatched Naruto out of his arms. The villager lifted his arm in the are to throw Naruto, who was still in a ball form. Before the village had the change to throw Naruto, Kyuubi grabbed his arm.</p><p>"What do you think you are doing?" Kyuubi asked, with anger in his eyes.</p><p>"The little brat needs to learn a lesson on not messing with our guest" the villagers answered.</p><p>"That little brat is my mate, and if you don't want to loose a arm I suggest you let him go." Kyuubi warned with anger in his voice. Kyuubi began to tight his grip on the arm until the man gave Naruto back. Kyuubi let go of the mans arm after he got Naruto back.</p><p>"Why would you want a half breed for a mate?" the villager asked, holding his arm.</p><p>"Because, I never seen such beautiful furry or eyes before in a fox" Kyuubi smiled down at Naruto, who was still curled in a ball. Kyuubi started to walk away from the villager.</p><p><b>August Stark:</b>Try to guess who the black wolf is.</p><p>Here are your chooses:</p><p>1. Sasuke Uchiha</p><p>2. Kakashi Hyuuga</p><p>3.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p>Chapter two: Meet the family and friends</p><p>Kyuubi made his way down the streets. He was only there for a little while, and already had woman all over him. There were blonds, burnet, black, and woman with colored hair. They were all over him like 'fleas to a dog.' No matter how many times you flicked them off they would just jump back on.</p><p>Kyuubi was not just good looking, he was drop dead sexy. He looked like one of those guys from a magazine or the movies... Kyuubi was one of those guys that both woman and man wanted or wanted to be.</p><p>Kyuubi would push back his long hair, trying to get it out of his face. Each time he did this teenage girls or woman would; scream, giggle, or moan. He would even make things worse by giving off a devilish smile each time. Making everything worse by throwing their arms around him.</p><p><b>Iruka and Kakashi</b></p><p>A brown dog with a scare over his nose, sniffed around The Forest of Death. Along with a white wolf, who were looking for Naruto scent?</p><p>"I found Naruto's scent Iruka." the white wolf told Iruka. Who made his way over to the white wolf?</p><p>"Is he ok Kakashi" Iruka asked, with panic in his voice.</p><p>"No he's not, he is badly beaten up. Not only that he is in heat again and being chased by an unfamiliar fox scent." Kakashi pointed out. He began to follow where the sent went. Then he stopped and began to sniff around. "There was a fight" Kakashi stated.</p><p>"Is Naruto ok?" Iruka asked, with panic still in his voice.</p><p>"No, he was bitten" Kakashi told him. "But the fight was between the unknown fox and a wolf." Kakashi growled at the name.</p><p>"What? Please tell me neither of them has him?" Iruka asked.</p><p>"Sorry, but yes, the fox has him. They went into town." Kakashi told Iruka, they both started to head for town.</p><p><b>Kyuubi and Naruto</b></p><p>A bunch of woman was all over Kyuubi, and he was enjoying every moment of it. Naruto on the other was getting squished, elbowed, and hit. Naruto was getting tired of being hurt to day. One of the woman knocked Naruto out of Kyuubi's arms. Naruto fell to the ground.</p><p>"You want to come back to my place, we can have some fun." A green haired woman whispered in Kyuubi ear.</p><p>"No, I'm sorry already have a mate." Kyuubi smiled down at her.</p><p>"I don't see her around. So what she doesn't know won't hurt, right." She smiled at him, rapped her arms around Kyuubi.</p><p>"No, he is with me." Kyuubi pointed out, looked down at his arms. To find Naruto was not in his arms anymore. Kyuubi looked around to find Naruto on the ground being kicked and stepped on. "Move" Kyuubi said try to push the girls out of his way.</p><p>"But we can be so much better." A short blond hair woman moaned. Kyuubi tried to get loose, he didn't want to hit or yell a woman.</p><p>"GET OUT OF MY WAY!" A woman with long black hair yelled. The women around Kyuubi moved away. The woman with long black hair bent down and picks Naruto up in her arms. Then began to walk away with Naruto in her hands.</p><p>"Hay, where do you think you're going with my mate?" Kyuubi yelled, running past the entire woman. The woman turned around to face Kyuubi, with anger in her eyes.</p><p>"You are so dead when Iruka finds out about this." the black haired woman told him.</p><p>"Who the hell are you, and who the hell is Iruka?" Kyuubi asked, with anger.</p><p>"Mikoto Uchiha and that guy over there is Iruka." Mikoto pointed at a man with a hair up and a scare over his nose. You could tell the man was looking for something, not only that he was angry.</p><p>"May I have my mate back, and can you show me the way to your house I'm meeting with your family today." Kyuubi told Mikoto Uchiha, while reaching for Naruto. Kyuubi went flying across the ground. <i>'What the hell just happen? I never have been knocked down before.' </i>Kyuubi told himself, getting up and dusting him off. Kyuubi turned around to walk over to the man that pushed him.</p><p>"Naruto what happen, to you?" Iruka asked, picking Naruto up out of Mikoto arms. Iruka looked Naruto over, see how bad he was hurt. "We need to get you to Tsunade's." Iruka panicked, still checking over Naruto. "WHAT THE HELL, IS THIS A COLLAR!" Iruka yelled, stating to mess with the collar. "Who the hell put this on you?" Iruka asked, still messing with the collar.</p><p>"Iruka please stop before….AHHHHHHH!" Naruto yelled, after being shocked. Iruka pulled away from the collar, not wanting to help Naruto anymore.</p><p>"Naruto are you ok?" asked Iruka, taking Naruto out of Mikoto arms.</p><p>"I'll be ok." Naruto smiled at Iruka.</p><p>"Good, because I would never hurt you on purpose." Iruka smiled, hugging Naruto. "I love you to munch to hurt you." Iruka gentle petted Naruto's fur. Naruto loved this feeling and cuddled into it. Kyuubi seen this and grow angry, and tackled Iruka. Naruto went flying into the air.</p><p>"NARUTO!" Mikoto yelled, running to catch Naruto. Kakashi caught Naruto before Mikoto could.</p><p>"That was close one, you mommy would be pissed if I let you hit the ground." Kakashi smiled, with Naruto in his arms.</p><p>"MOMMY!" Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"Yes, Iruka is Naruto's mommy. The guy you just attacked." Mikoto pointed out, looking over at Iruka.</p><p>"WHAT!" Kyuubi yelled, looking over at Iruka. Iruka was pissed off, so he punched Kyuubi in the cheek.</p><p>"WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!" Iruka yelled, with anger in his eyes.</p><p>"My name is Kyuubi, and I'm Naruto's mate" Kyuubi told Iruka, while standing up.</p><p>"Mate, Naruto is this true?" Iruka asked, looking over at Naruto.</p><p>"Yes, but not by choose. By the time the fight was over, I was too weak to fight. So he took me as his mate that what the collar is for. So people know I belong to him." Naruto told Iruka, who was stunned.</p><p>"Did he hurt you in the process?" Iruka asked, talking Naruto from Kakashi.</p><p>"No, he was really kind. The other demons wanted to hurt me, but Kyuubi saved me." Naruto told Iruka, looking up at him.</p><p>"That's good" Iruka smiled hugging Naruto. Naruto in braced the hug that was given to him.</p><p>"I would hurt him, the only thing I want to do is fuck him until he can't walk strait for a week." Kyuubi admitted to everyone. Kyuubi began to think about all the things he could do to Naruto, when they would have sex. All the blood rushed to his face giving him a nose bleed from out of this world. Then he fell to the ground.</p><p>"OH GOD, WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED? IS HE DEAD? WHY IS HIS NOSE BLEEDING?" Naruto asked, none answered him. Kakashi dropped his book, and began to laugh.</p><p>"He is so dead, Naruto you might not have a mate." Kakashi laughed as he picked his book back up.</p><p>"Pervert" both Iruka and Mikoto muttered.</p><p>"You want to have dinner with us tonight?" Mikoto asked with a smile.</p><p>"Yah, Sasuke would be happy." Iruka answered, smiling back at her.</p><p>"Not only that you can talk with Kyuubi a bit more. Since he is to be at our house talking with my husband about our son, Sasuke." Mikoto said, looking at Kyuubi who was out cold with a smile on his face. "Kakashi, can you DRAG HIM to my house." Mikoto asked making shore he under stood the DRAG part. Kakashi surged his shoulders and began to drag Kyuubi off toward Mikoto house. Kakashi didn't even try to miss a rock, because he knows if he did Iruka would be yelling at him.</p><p>When they arrived at Uchiha main house, they called Tsunade, asking her to come out to the Uchiha's main house. Telling he Naruto is badly hurt. Tsunade didn't was anytime getting there. When she got there, and seen what condition Naruto was in. She wanted to hit something, but Fugaku told her "If you break anything you pay for it." She wanted to punch Fugaku square in the nose for stopping her, but she didn't want to hear him bitch about it later.</p><p>"What the hell happened?" Tsunade asked, looking at everyone in the room.</p><p>"I was attacked by some of the villagers, but was saved by Kyuubi" Naruto told her, hopping down from the counter top. Naruto walked over to were Kyuubi was lying on the ground. Naruto climbed on top of Kyuubi. "Why is his nose still bleeding?" Naruto asked, smacking Kyuubi nose.</p><p>"We not going to tell you, so stop asking." Iruka told him. Naruto sat down on top of Kyuubi and began to pout. Naruto felt something poke him, so he stood up and smacked it. Kyuubi made a hissing noise. Naruto sat back down, but something poked him again. This time Naruto was annoyed, so this time when he smacked it he used his claws.</p><p>"AHHHH, son of a bitch!" Kyuubi yelled, when he shot up. Everyone looked over at Kyuubi to see what had happened. Kyuubi looked down at his pants, where he saw Naruto claws where still in his dick still. "Naruto what are you doing?" Kyuubi asked with a twitch in his eye.</p><p>"It kept poking me and I pushed it away but I would stop. So I clawed at it, did I do something wrong?" Naruto asked, looking around. Kakashi, Iruka, and Fugaku jaws where on the floor in shock. Tsunade and Mikoto where laughing there ass off. "Yes, and know remove your claws from my dick." Naruto removed his claws, felling really bad for what he did. "I will make you pay for that latter." Kyuubi smiled evil at Naruto. Naruto began shiver at what Kyuubi said to him.</p><p>"Oh, why was your nose bleeding?" Naruto asked, looking up at Kyuubi.</p><p>"I was thinking dirty thoughts." Kyuubi smiled at Naruto. Everyone glared at Kyuubi, except for Naruto. Who had that "what" look on his face.</p><p>"What do you mean?" Naruto asked, Kyuubi was stunned that Naruto didn't know what he meant.</p><p>"I mean was thinking of having sex with you. " Kyuubi admitted, everyone glared at Kyuubi.</p><p>"What's sex?" Naruto asked, looking around.</p><p>"Alright why the hell didn't tell Naruto about the birds and bees?" Kyuubi asked picking Naruto up and walking over to the table were everyone was.</p><p>"Iruka, that's your fault. I told you to tell him about mating and all of that." Kakashi stated, still reading his book.</p><p>"I get nerves, each time I go to tell him. But he is so innocent and I didn't want him to change." Iruka admitted to everyone. "But I guess it time to tell him"</p><p>"No, I will show him when the time comes." Kyuubi smiled. Everyone glared at him for what he had said.</p><p>"Dinners done" Mikoto smiled, coming into the dining room. "I made Curry and rice." Sasuke had come down stair to have dinner. Sasuke had spotted Naruto from across the room sitting in a strangers lap.</p><p>"Sasuke!" Naruto said happily, jumping off Kyuubi lap and walking over to Sasuke.</p><p>"Naruto is that a collar?" Sasuke asked, looking at the collar.</p><p>"The collar is to show that Naruto is my mate." Kyuubi said with jalousie in his eyes.</p><p>"That's great, know we both have mates. " Sasuke smiled.</p><p>"Kyuubi this is my son, Sasuke. He and Naruto have been friends for years." Fugaku smiled. "The reason I asked you here is so I can ask you here is on the behalf of my son. I was wounding if he could start an Uchiha clan in your village?" Fugaku asked. Kyuubi at his meal in silence. Naruto and Sasuke talked, until the doorbell rang. Sasuke left to answer it. It was Sakura, Sasuke's soon to be mate. Sakura spotted Naruto in his fox form. She loved it when he was in this form, he was so cute. Sakura was all over Naruto hugging him and kissing say how cute he is like this.</p><p>"PUT HIM DOWN!" Kyuubi roared at Sakura got so scarred that she accidentally dropped Naruto in his Curry. Naruto was known covered in Curry and rice. "Give me tonight to think about it." Kyuubi told Fugaku.</p><p>"Ok we will let you stay in our guest room tonight" Fugaku smiled, Mikoto began to pick up the plates.</p><p>"Well I better get Naruto home so I can give him a bath." Iruka told everyone, walking over to Naruto picked him up and began to leave.</p><p>"Sorry but Naruto will be staying with me. I'm very possessive over my things." Kyuubi pointed out, take Naruto away from Iruka.</p><p>"WHAT?" Iruka yelled.</p><p>"Iruka lets just go, Naruto has to get used to being around Kyuubi." Kakashi told him.</p><p>"Fine, but no sex." Iruka glared at Kyuubi.</p><p>"There's none of that until we get home. I plan to teach him foreplay." Kyuubi smiled, before shutting the door in Iruka and Kakashi face. "Is there a bathroom in the guest room?" Kyuubi asked, looking at Naruto who was trying to clean himself.</p><p>"Yes, I'll show you to the guestroom." Mikoto answered, heading up stairs to the last door on the right. "Here we are." Mikoto told them, opening the door. Kyuubi walked in with Naruto in his arms.</p><p>"I like the color. Thank you for the room Miss. Uchiha" Kyuubi smiled, seating Naruto down on the ground.</p><p>"You can call me Mikoto. Also, IF I HEAR NARUTO YELL STOP IT HURTS I WILL KILL YOU." Mikoto warned him before leaving.</p><p>"She can be scary some times." Kyuubi said. Kyuubi looked around for Naruto, who was in the bathroom. "Naruto what are you doing?" Kyuubi asked, stepping into the bathroom.</p><p>"I need a bath." Naruto told him, trying to get into the tub. Kyuubi walks over to the shower and turns on the water.</p><p>"We can take a bath together." Kyuubi smiled.</p><p>"NO!" Naruto yelled.</p><p>"Yes you are." Kyuubi smiled. Naruto began to run for the door. Kyuubi shut the door and locked it. Kyuubi began to undress, showing of his dark tanned skin. Naruto was scared to see Kyuubi naked, mainly because he never seen another naked man before. Kyuubi dropped his pants; Naruto got scared and began to claw at the door. "I'm not going to hurt you." Kyuubi smiled. "I'm going to take off you collar, and I want to see your human form." Kyuubi told him, taking off his collar.</p><p>After the collar was taken off, Naruto began to turn into his human form. Naruto grabbed a towel, to cover up his lower half up. Kyuubi was shocked at what he saw. The boy had golden blond hair with ears and tail that matched, and light tan skin. He had curves that a woman would kill for. Not only that the boy looked like someone he had seen before.</p><p>"Naruto, why do you have your ears and tails? And how old are you, because you look fifteen or sixteen?" Kyuubi asked.</p><p>"Well you see I'm a half breed. I'm half-human and half-fox, so when I'm in my human form I will have my fox ears and tails. And I'm eighteen" Naruto declared, rapping his tail around him.</p><p>"That's ok; it just wants me to take you more." Kyuubi smiled. "But for now let's clean you up." Kyuubi grabbed Naruto's hand and pulled him into the shower. Naruto washed his tail and hair. While Kyuubi washed his own hair. When they both were done, they hopped out and dried themselves off.</p><p>Kyuubi pick Naruto up in his arms and carried him into the bedroom. Kyuubi laid Naruto on the bed. Naruto was trying to hide his lower half with his tails. Naruto was trembling; he didn't know what was going to happen.</p><p>"Naruto I'm going to teach you what foreplay is. I will make you feel really good." Kyuubi smiled, placing a hand on Naruto's cheats. Kyuubi rubbed his hand up and down Naruto chest gently. Kyuubi discovered Naruto is very sensitive, because he would tense up at each touch. Kyuubi then rubbed Naruto nipple gently with his finger. Naruto never felt this way before, he felt weird but felt good. Naruto was holding back his moans. This made Kyuubi upset, he wanted to hear Naruto voice when he touched him.</p><p>"Naruto I want to hear your voice." Kyuubi whispered, rubbing his nipple between his fingers. Naruto began to give off little moans, but Kyuubi wasn't satisfied. Kyuubi moved his other hand down to Naruto private area. Kyuubi took his finger from the bottom of Naruto cock to the tip.</p><p>"Aaaahhhh… don't…. aaaahhhh… that's dirty." Naruto blushed, trying to cover his face with his arms. Kyuubi removed Naruto's arms away from his face.</p><p>"I want to see your face Naruto." Kyuubi muttered, leaning in to give Naruto a passionate kiss. Naruto did reject the kiss, instead enjoyed it. Kyuubi nibbled at Naruto bottom lip. Then he licked Naruto lips, wanting to enter his mouth. Naruto opened his mouth letting Kyuubi enter. They both French kissed for a while before pulling away from each other. Naruto and Kyuubi had lust in their eyes. Kyuubi began to mess with the tip of Naruto's cock, rubbing his thumb on the tip in a circle motion.</p><p>"AAAAHHHH!" Naruto moaned. "I…. I fe…el weird aaaahhhh." Naruto stuttered.</p><p>"Do you feel good?" Kyuubi asked, liking Naruto left nipple. Naruto shock his head yes. "I want you to say it Naruto." Kyuubi smiled, before biting Naruto nipple gently.</p><p>"AAAAHHHH. Yes it feels really good!" Naruto moaned really loud. "I want feel more, please." Naruto begged, putting his arms around Kyuubi neck. Kyuubi smiled, pulled Naruto away his neck and laid him back on the bed.</p><p>"Ok" Kyuubi smiled, kissing Naruto on the lips one more time. Kyuubi began to pump Naruto's cock, as well lick and suck on his nipples. After a few more time Naruto came, all over his chest and Kyuubi hand. Kyuubi brought his hand to his face, and liked his hand. Naruto was lying on the bed panting. "All right Naruto, I'm going to teach you something. You know how I made you feel good, well you're going to make me feel good." Kyuubi told him, wiping Naruto's chest off with a towel that was lying on the floor next to the bed.</p><p>"What?" Naruto asked sitting up.</p><p>"I'm going to tell you what to do, alright?" Kyuubi asked, Naruto nodded his head yes. "Good, know hop on the floor and get on your knees." Naruto did what Kyuubi told him to do. Kyuubi sat on the edge of the bed, in front of Naruto. "You will be playing with this." Kyuubi smiled, showing Naruto his pennies. Naruto was worried at what was going to happen. "We will start simple. Give it a kiss, like when I kissed you on the forehead." Kyuubi advised him. Naruto gave a big gulp before leaning and kissing it. "Good." Kyuubi smiled, putting his hand on Naruto's head. "Now talk your left hand and placed it on my balls." Naruto hesitated at this before doing as told. "Now talk you right hand and placed around my cock gently." Naruto didn't hesitate this time.</p><p>"I can't get my hand full around it." Naruto blurted, making Kyuubi chuckled.</p><p>"That because it thick Naruto. Now stick out your tongue and run it over the tip, like you would do with ice cream." Kyuubi chuckled, watching Naruto do as he said. Kyuubi hissed at the feel of Naruto tongue. "Naruto, look at me when you do this. I want to see your face." Kyuubi smiled, lifting Naruto head. Naruto cheeks where red as can be. <i>'He looks so cute like this.' </i>Kyuubi told himself, pulling Naruto's face away. "Know use your tongue and lick from the bottom up. Do this until it nice and wet." Kyuubi said, pushing Naruto hair back. Naruto gulped again before starting. Kyuubi gave off a low hiss or moan. Naruto did this for several min, before Kyuubi pulled him away. "Know I want you to put my cock in your mouth and suck on it like it's a sucker." Kyuubi smiled. Naruto put Kyuubi's cock in his mouth, then pulled away.</p><p>"Is too big, I can't fit it all in." Naruto blushed, looking up at Kyuubi.</p><p>"It eleven and a half inches Naruto, I didn't expect you to fit it all in your mouth." Kyuubi sighed.

Kyuubi sat there thinking of who Naruto reminds him of. <I>'Minato, that is who he reminds me of' </I>Kyuubi said to himself. "Naruto, is Kakashi and Iruka your real parents?" Kyuubi asked, taking a bit out of his fish.</P><P>"No, they adopted me." Naruto said, eating another bowl of Raman.</P><P>"Why do you ask?" Kakashi asked, looking over at Kyuubi. Everyone but Naruto looked over to Kyuubi.</P><P>"Well believe it or not, but I thick I know Naruto real parents? Not only that I also believe he was born in Kyuubi Village?"
