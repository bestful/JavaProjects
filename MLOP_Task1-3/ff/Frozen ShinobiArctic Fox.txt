Arctic Fox</B></U></P><P>In a sealed room,
beneath the Hokage tower, it is cold. The temperature is forty below
freezing. In this room there is ice, snow, and a lone boy. His skin
is as blue as his cerulean eyes. His hair is like snow, but with blue
streaks as well. He sits on a throne of carved ice and watches a TV
in its' cold resistant case that keeps it from freezing over.</P><P>The boys' breath is
only slightly visible as it escapes his mouth. It, like him, being
only slightly warmer than the room he's in.</P><P>Seeing nothing worth
watching, the boy reminisces. He recalls how he came to be here.</P><P>It was two years ago.
His name, Naruto Uzumaki. He was a happy boy, in appearance anyway.
He was walking home from the academy, starting his third attempted
class to pass. But, fate, and the villagers, was cruel. An anbu with
the word ROOT on his mask snatched him up, knocked him out, and took
him to ROOT headquarters. There, under the watch of Danzo, they put
him through the most unspeakable tortures. They sliced off parts of
his skin and watched as it re-grew. They took blood samples and
performed gene experiments of them. He was injected with many
different, and painful, experimental drugs and serums. Then, came
that fateful day. The ROOT doctors had just injected him with a
sample of hyoton or ice user bloodline blood into him with a
gene-splicing compound, when the Hokage, followed by a woman with
purple hair and fishnet clothes and a scarred man with a bandanna and
many normal anbu, stormed into the room. They fought with ROOT and,
during the fight, knocked the table Naruto was strapped to into a
huge vat of cryo-coolant. An experimental substance to freeze or
preserve bodies of allies and enemies perfectly when scroll were not
available.</P><P>Naruto, even after all
he'd been through, had never felt such pain. The chemical, along
with the hyoton bloodline blood was being added to his genetic make
up. With the added Kyuubi healing factor, he was changed forever.
When they fished him out and found he was alive…they also found
that anything he touched would freeze in seconds.</P><P>They loaded him up into
a metal box that quickly froze from the inside, and carried him to a
sealed storage room under the Hokage tower. They got him some clothes
that had seals on them that protected them from his icy touch and the
Hokage, Ibiki, and Anko, wrapped in winter clothing, stood in the
room with him. The Hokage had tried to get him to talk, but he
wouldn't say a word. The old man and Ibiki eventually stopped
trying and left him there with some food on a seal induced hot plate
that kept his food warm despite his icy touch.</P><P>Anko was the only one
who continued to visit. She understood what it felt like to be a
freak of an experiment and had always felt a sense of kinship with
the young demon container since, like her, he was shunned through no
fault of his own.</P><P>He eventually spoke to
her and they talked. He told her of his tortures and of the man in
bandages that ran things. Anko was livid. She knew who the man was
and would speak to the Hokage about it later. Naruto told her his
desire to use his new powers and asked if he could learn seals to
make his…condition…into a weapon for him and the Hokage to use.</P><P>She smiled and said
she'd ask the old man.</P><P>The Hokage was livid as
well but couldn't find proof Danzo did anything as he would surely
say those ROOT members were told to disband and disobeyed him and
that the only one to implicate him was the "demon brat" who was
now a monster even more than before to the civilian side of the
council. The ninja side of the council was very sympathetic to the
poor boy, even though they didn't know the extent of his change or
injuries yet, and, when Anko told them of the boys' desires, away
from the civilian council and Danzo, they were proud of his
determination to push through his…quit frankly…horrid nightmare
of an ordeal.</P><P>The Hokage had
anti-freezing seal covered paper, pencils (since ink would freeze out
of the pot), and books on sealing.</P><P>Naruto worked for a
year on his designs for seals and, oddly enough, armor. He was a
bright boy, but due to prejudice, his teachers sabotaged him and that
kept his intellect hidden.</P><P>When it was done, he
asked Anko to give it to the old man and she smiled and went off to
do it.</P><P>When the old Hokage had
seen the seal and armor designs, he'd laughed and smiled. The boy
was brilliant. He'd had the armor commissioned and ready in two
months and applied the seals by carving them on and tracing the
inside of the carvings with chakra ink to set them. The armor would
now keep all his cold in and allow him to touch things again without
freezing them. Also, by adding chakra to his palms, he could open
them and focus his chakra out into a freezing ice chakra beam.</P><P>(His armor is the same
as freeze's from Batman and Robin with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Except his armor has a blue tinted visor over the face that lets him
see out and no one see in.)</P><P>Naruto studied hard on
the ice jutsu the old Hokage got for him from various scrolls and
ninja. Naruto had to open his palm area to use chakra for outside
body jutsu with his suit on. He learned that, with ice, he also had
an equal affinity for water and wind. Though lacking a bit in wind
jutsu, Naruto learned as much as he could from all the water and wind
scrolls they had.</P><P>Naruto awoke from his
reminiscing when he heard a knock on his door.</P><P>"Enter." He said in
his near lifeless voice. Only the old man, Anko, and Ibiki could come
down to him. He wasn't in his armor, but in a black pair of shinobi
pants and a white shinobi sleeveless shirt.</P><P>Ibiki entered. "Hello,
Freeze." Naruto had long ago decided that, only with Anko and the
Hokage, and only in private, could anyone call him Naruto. To
everyone else, he was Freeze.</P><P>"Hello, Ibiki-san.
What brings you down to my cold patch of hell." Naruto said in his
emotionless voice. Naruto still had emotions, but they were saved for
Anko, the Hokage, and anyone who gave him a good enough fight.</P><P>"Your graduating
class has passed their gennin tests. However, a chunnin by the name
of Mizuki stole the forbidden scroll of sealing and…well…the
Hokage thinks this will be an excellent way for you to renter the
world." Ibiki smirked.</P><P>Naruto, in a rare slip,
smirked as well. "I shall be up shortly."</P><P>Naruto then stood and
walked over to his armor. Once it was on, he walked out of the room
and up the stairs.</P><P>Ibiki was told by the
Hokage the direction Mizuki headed and he passed that onto Naruto.</P><P>Naruto nodded and then
took off with wind chakra flowing around him to speed his pace.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>As Ibiki entered the
Hokages' office, everyone from the council and most of the jounin
were gathered there. Ibiki nodded to the old man and he nodded back.</P><P>"Why are we all here?
Shouldn't we be out looking for Mizuki?" Iruka asked.</P><P>"Yes, Hokage-sama. We
must stop him from getting away with that scroll." Hiashi Hyuuga
stated.</P><P>The Hokage smiled,
which confused all but three of those in the room. "It is being
dealt with." He said as he pulled out his seeing crystal ball.</P><P>"How so?" Danzo
asked.</P><P>The Hokage looked at
him and smirked. "Why, by the test subject of you 'renegade'
ROOT soldiers Danzo."</P><P>Danzo looked slightly
surprised. "Really?"</P><P>"Yes. He has mastered
his 'gifts' and I have sent him after the traitor." The Hokage
said.</P><P>"Who are you
referring to, Hokage-sama?" Tsume Inuzuka asked. It had been years
since they had heard about Naruto so he slipped their minds.</P><P>"Watch and see."
The old man said with a smile as an image of a young man in full body
armor raced through the trees.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>Naruto pumped chakra
into his eyes as he ran through the forest through the trees. His ice
blue sharingan came to life in his eyes. It wasn't just hyoton
blood that the ROOT bastards injected him with. They also injected
Uchiha blood and Inuzuka blood. The sharingan, at it's third level
currently, allowed him to run as fast as he wanted without fear of
running into things, and the Inuzuka beast-like bloodline gave him
animal senses and abilities. He even had an advanced version of their
all fours and man-beast jutsus.</P><P>He allowed his nose to
guide him to the only fresh scent along the direction Mizuki was
headed.</P><P>He finally found the
traitor with the scroll at his side, as he appeared to be resting.</P><P>Naruto smirked behind
his visor and opened his palm valves to release chakra for a jutsu.</P><P>"Hidden mist jutsu."
He said in a whisper.</P><P>Slowly, mist settled in
and covered the area around Mizuki.</P><P>"What in the-"?
Mizuki said as he noticed the mist.</P><P>Then, all around him, a
cage of thick ice appeared. He looked around and found that, while
partially covered by mist, he could see the ceiling and sides of the
cage. The floor was frozen over and he shuddered from fear and the
dropped temperature.</P><P>He heard a footstep
from behind him and turned. The deep blue lights of Narutos' armor
came to life, outlining and illuminating his armored form from behind
the vale of the mist.</P><P>"Surprise, I'm your
new cellmate." He stepped forward and his sightless visor unnerved
Mizuki. "And I've come to make your life a living hell." Mizuki
further cringed at his deep, emotionless, cold voice. "Prepare for
a bitter harvest…" He suddenly appeared right before Mizuki.
"Winter…has come at last!" He then grabbed Mizukis' left arm
with his right and pulled the scroll from his grasp with his
valve-closed left.</P><P>Mizuki screamed as, in
barely a few seconds, his whole body was frozen over and every bone,
organ, and cell turned to ice.</P><P>Freeze then, with a
single sweep of his right hand, shattered the traitor into small
shards of ice.</P><P>Freeze looked up
towards the sky. "Traitor eliminated and scroll recovered
Hokage-sama. I shall return shortly."</P><P>He then turned and, in
a feet of blinding speed, dashed away while the ice cage shattered
and the mist drifted away.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>"Who was that!?"
Inoichi Yamanaka asked.</P><P>Anko looked at Tsume.
"Watching him work makes you hot, huh?" She said with a smirk.
Tsume could only nod. His cold power and dramatic execution
was…thrilling to watch.</P><P>The Hokage smirked and
cleared his throat. "That, my friends, was a jounin level ninja who
has yet to take the gennin exam." They looked shocked. "He was
prevented by 'rebel' ROOT operatives stealing him away, putting
him through the most unspeakable tortures, and experimenting
different bloodline fusion drugs on him."</P><P>Everyone looked shocked
and several sent a scowl to Danzo.</P><P>The Hokage continued.
"That young man was once…Naruto Uzumaki."</P><P>Everyone gaped. "T-That
was the container!" A civilian councilman said in slight fear.</P><P>"Yes. Due to an
accident during his…tortures, while we rescued him, he was
irreversibly changed. He has an overactive hyoton bloodline that
causes everything he touches to freeze. The armor he wears has
special seals that keep his powers contained. He also has an advanced
version of the Inuzuka bloodline and a blue, three-tomoed sharingan."</P><P>Everyone was struck
dumb. Tsume growled at Danzos' direction and was near ready to kill
him.</P><P>"I and two others
have helped train him in control, seals, and ice, wind, and water
jutsu. He is jounin level and I've decided to make him a special
jounin. His performance tonight should prove he is above a chunnin
let alone a gennin." The Hokage said with a smirk.</P><P>No one could deny it.
He clearly was over-skilled for anything less.</P><P>"But Hokage-sama, how
can we let that…that boy be a ninja. If he can't touch anyone
without the suit he can't reproduce so there is no bloodline value
in him. He could still turn on us. I still think he is the fox in
human form." A random Civilian council said.</P><P>The Hokage looked
sternly at the man. "I know quite a few ninjas who, due to work
related problems, can no longer produce children and many more ninja
without bloodline who are great at their jobs. Such as myself, my
students Jaraiya and Tsunade, Iruka, Anko, Ibiki, need I go on?"</P><P>The councilman shut up,
having soundly been proven wrong.</P><P>"As for your beliefs
about the fox, it is no longer an issue." The Hokage smirked at the
confused faces of the council and jounin. "Apparently it is not
just the Firsts' bloodline that subdues demons. The hyoton can do
it to a limited degree. Added with the Inuzuka bloodline and the
mutated sharingan, he has not only taken a large portion of the fox's
power permanently, but he has…reincarnated the fox inside him."
This really confused everyone.</P><P>"What do you mean,
Hokage-sama.?" Shibi Aburame asked.</P><P>"I mean that, the
tailed creatures couldn't be destroyed, so when they 'die' they
are born into new bodies, minds, and sometimes forms. The fox, after
Narutos' change, was reborn into the form of a snow white nine
tailed fox that is both kind, apologetic for its' last life,
and…female."</P><P>Jaws nearly broke
through the floor.</P><P>"FEMALE!" The
collective group, minus three, shouted.</P><P>"Yes, female." The
Hokage stated. "So, there is no need to hold anymore prejudice
towards this new Kyuubi or Naruto. Leave the past where it belongs
or, if enough of this village turns on him, we might have a literal
force of nature wielded against us by him and it will be our fault
for causing it." Everyone contemplated this and several civilians
nodded. If the Kyuubi that attacked was 'dead' then they couldn't
hold anything against the new Kyuubi. Especially if this new one was
controlled by one of <I>their</I> shinobi</P><P>The door to the office
opened and an armored Freeze walked in. Everyone went silent. He
silently walked past everyone and they noticed that, most likely due
to the experiments, he stood around 5' 10". The armored demon
container set the scroll on the Hokages' desk.</P><P>"I have completed my
mission, Hokage-sama." Freeze said.</P><P>"That you have,
Freeze." The old man nodded. "Now, I would like you to meet the
council and jounin of the village." He gestured to all those in the
room.</P><P>Naruto looked around,
His sightless visor unnerving them just as it had with Mizuki.</P><P>When Naruto caught
sight of Danzo, he stopped. Everyone felt the tension in the room as
Freeze/Naruto walked over to the old bandaged man. He reached up and
removed his helmet. Everyone, the women mostly, looked at his young,
yet mature, face. His white and blue streaked hair was still spiked,
but spiked towards the back of his head. His blue skin and ice blue
eyes were exotic to some of the women, interesting or weird to some
men, and freaky to all others. They also noticed a drop in
temperature as the helmet was removed.</P><P>He reached out and laid
his right hand on Danzos' shoulder while holding his helmet in his
left.</P><P>"I wish to express my
gratitude to you for giving me my gifts." Freeze/Naruto said.</P><P>"I don't know what
you're talk-" He was cut off as Freeze tightened his grip. "And
now I'd like to curse you for forever denying me the warmth of
human comfort." In a flash, Danzo was frozen solid. With a familiar
flick of his wrist, Naruto broke off Danzos' head. He caught it
before it hit the ground and walked back towards the Hokage.</P><P>There were many looks
of horror, and smirks of satisfaction at what Freeze had just done.</P><P>Freeze set the frozen
head of Danzo on the Hokages' desk. "Assassination mission,
complete, Hokage-sama." Freeze said with his emotionless voice.</P><P>The Hokage nodded and
looked at those gathered in the room. "I have uncovered proof of
Danzos' treachery to not only myself, but all the clans and people
of this village. Freeze is just one of his many victims. He was going
a similar path my fallen student was on when he left. I could not let
it continue, so I decided to allow Freeze a measure of revenge to
serve the village."</P><P>Every one of the
civilians gulped and nodded while the ninja clan heads and jounin
just nodded in understanding.</P><P>The Hokage looked at
Freeze. "Freeze, you may return home. I will call you for your next
mission later." Freeze nodded and left.</P><P>The Hokage looked at
the people in his office. "I've decided to let him help train any
gennin team that graduates alongside their regular jounin sensei.
With his sharingan and Inuzuka bloodlines, he would be able to help
out Kiba and Sasuke. He will not try to get techniques from them,
since he likes to invent his own, so no need to worry about it. He
will meet both Kiba and Sasukes' team when they have been decided
and passed their jounin issued gennin test. Dismissed." Everyone
left and had one thought on their mind.</P><P>DON'T…TICK…OFF…FREEZE!</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>It's' been an hour
since Freeze left the Hokages' office. He's sitting on his icy
throne and flipping through channels on his TV. He shuts it off and
reflects on his performance tonight. He'd tracked, found and taken
out the traitor with ease. He'd recovered the scroll and killed
his…conditions' instigator. Last but not least, he'd made a
good impression on the council and jounin…well, good for him.</P><P>As his mind wandered to
how the rest of the village would react, the door to his…room…cell,
opened. In stepped the Hokage, Anko, Kakashi, Kurenai, Gai,
and…Hiashi Hyuuga?</P><P>Naruto looked at the
newcomers with an air of…cold, indifference. "Hokage-sama, for
what reason do you bring these people to my frozen corner of hell?"
Freeze asked in a tone that was neither polite nor hostile.</P><P>The Hokage smiled
slightly. "Well, Freeze, I just wanted you to meet the senseis and
family member of some of your soon-to-be students."</P><P>Freeze didn't show
any emotion. He simply remained motionless atop his crystal-like
throne.</P><P>He was so unmoving and
emotionless that he could pass for a sculpture.</P><P>Hiashi stepped forward.
"Since you will be training the teams my daughter and nephew are
one, there are certain things you will need to do." He was about to
say more when Freeze lifted his right hand in a halting gesture.</P><P>"I have not decided
to train anyone. Who I train is my discretion. As for your demands, I
am not like miss Yuuhi. I have no emotional or personal attachment to
any one of those gennin. I will obey the orders given by the Third
Hokage, no one else. If you feel your family members' training is
lacking, train them on their and your own time. I have no fear of you
Hyuuga. I lost that when a member of the village council used me as a
lab rat. Also, if I do train them, my word is law when they take
orders from me. It will be beyond reproach from you, your families'
council, and the village council. I will not baby clan heirs. If I
train anyone, they will not leave until they are real ninja, not the
ill-prepared delusional fools the academy allows to be spawned from
itself." His tone was colder than the icy room they were in and
even with the winter coats they wore, they had chills.</P><P>Hiashi was slightly
mad, but respected Freeze for his honesty. Kurenai was also a bit
miffed at him using her as an example of what not to do…but had to
admit his words held no malice or jeering. He was simply stating
their differences.</P><P>Kakashi tried to
lighten the mood. "Well, Naruto, I-" He was cut off by Freeze
freezing his book in his hands until it was completely encased in
ice.</P><P>The one-eyed jounin
looked slightly stricken and everyone except the Hokage and Anko
looked surprised. They all looked at Naruto. "Hatake." His cold
voice seemed to be the reapers over a grave. "No one except for the
Hokage and Anko, and only in private, may address me with my true
name. To all others, I am what this village has made me. Freeze, the
Arctic Fox. Do I make myself clear?"</P><P>Kakashi nodded.</P><P>"Good." Freeze said
calmly.</P><P>Gai was about to speak
but Freeze held up his hand. "Gai-san, while I'm sure you were
about to rant about the springtime of youth, you should know that has
been taken from me. I am now nothing but the harsh, stinging winter
that seals and buries all. Save your speeches for those young and
hopeful people this villages' corruption hasn't destroyed."</P><P>Everyone felt the
slight sting of regret at his words. They knew that, while the Hokage
had asked for everyone to help keep an eye on the boy, they had
ignored him and that had allowed for him to be captured and held for
so long.</P><P>Gai nodded and stepped
back.</P><P>Freeze then sighed. "I
will meet these teams of yours in three weeks. If by that time you
still wish them trained, I will inspect them and train them as I see
fit. That means that they will not be allowed to reveal my training,
if so I will stop their training immediately and move on with those
that remain. My rewards and punishments for success and failure will
be beyond reproach and, except for missions, the jounin senseis will
not be allowed to attend, watch, or interfere with my training. These
requirements are non negotiable. I will show no favoritism and I will
brook no excuse, not from anyone not for any reason." He then stood
up, only wearing his shinobi pants and sleeveless shirt. "Now, I am
tired and must rest. You are to tell no one where I live and ask the
Hokage for reports if you need any." With that, he turned and
walked towards a large bed with anti-freezing seals on all the
fabric.</P><P>They all left him and
closed the door as he fell into sleep.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>As they were walking up
the stairs of the tower, Kurenai walked beside Anko. "He seems,
pardon the pun, very cold."</P><P>Anko gave a small smile
of sadness. "Yes, I know." She looked at her friend. "They
tortured him Kurenai. They tortured a nine year old by cutting off
chunks of flesh and watching as it re-grew." They all looked
horrified and a bit green at that. They hadn't known about that
extent of the 'rebel' roots experiments on the poor boy. "They
injected him with highly experimental, sometimes corrosive
substances. For the first three months after we brought him to that
room and his skin froze it over, he wouldn't talk. I spent those
three months visiting him every day. The only reason he opened up to
me was because I was used like a lab rat too, just not as bad as he
was." Anko touched her shoulder.</P><P>"What is his mental
state now?" Hiashi asked.</P><P>The Hokage sighed. "He
is emotionless to everyone but me and Anko and only shows emotion in
private. He doesn't make threats, merely states what he will do
when you cross him. Or betray the Hokage. I say the Hokage because
the village lost his trust when they allowed him to be used like he
has." He sighed again. "It will be a long time before his icy
heart warms to anyone besides Anko and myself."</P><P>Everyone left with
quite a bit to think about.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>Deep in Narutos'
mindscape, the icy shinobi stood on a snow-covered hill with a few
bare and snow covered trees dotting the landscape around the hill.</P><P>He heard the sound of
footsteps crunching in the snow behind him and turned around. He saw
a beautiful young woman with blue and white streaked hair in a silver
kimono with a blue obi and no sandals. Her hair was long and was left
loose, cascading down her back, ending just above her rear. Her eyes
were crystal blue with flecks of silver. Her skin was pale as snow
and she had nine blue and silver streaked fox tails coming from her
tailbone.</P><P>Some tails wrapped
around her body while others swished back and forth.</P><P>"Hello, Naru-kun."
She said with a cheerful smile.</P><P>Naruto, still dressed
in his shinobi pants and shirt, walked over to her and gave her a
firm hug. He pulled back a little and looked into her gem-like eyes
and then…leaned in. They shared a deep kiss and she wrapped her
arms around his neck.</P><P>When they separated,
Naruto smiled at her. "Hello, Kyu-hime." He said with love and
warmth he'd never show outside of his mind except to Anko and the
Hokage.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>I will update in the
future, but I would also allow anyone to take this story and add on
from here on if they wanted. Like I've said before, I don't mind
people taking my ideas for cross over and even basic storyline as
long as they mention me somewhere and make it a good story. Until
next time…bye.</P>
