Bijuu/Summoning Thoughts</P><P>/In
Some Random Alley/</P><P>You
see we find one Uzumaki Naruto trying to fall asleep in a small box
in cold alleyway. Due to unfortunate circumstances you see, he was
kicked out of the orphanage... at the age of three. You see not many
people liked him very much due to... well, the inability to see
underneath the underneath, long story short he has the legendary
Kyuubi no Kitsune, the lord of demons sealed inside of him. But were
getting of subject here. Unknown to Naruto he was being watched, by a
certain white hooded man.</P><P><I>'Is
this my target? He's just a child!' </I>He
thought.</P><P>Not
too soon after he had that thought he noticed a small mob of people
heading towards the small boy. He decided to just watch and see what
would happen.</P><P>"Oh
demon spawn... WAKE UP, TIME TO DIE!!" The supposed leader yelled
as he kicked the defenseless child.</P><P>Naruto
woke up startled and gasping for air, "Wha-whats going on!?"</P><P>"Your
death that's what!" A pink haired woman that the hooded man could
only describe as a banshee said as she stabbed the boy in the left
leg. He screamed in nothing short of excruciating pain. It was then
that the banshee decided then and there that it was time to silence
him... so she slit his throat. The man decided that enough was enough
and jumped down behind the mob and pushed his way through to the
front only to see the sight of the boy being kicked and stabbed
several times. He had had enough.</P><P>"People
tell me why exactly that you're trying to kill an innocent child?"
He said barely containing his anger.</P><P>"INNOCENT!
THAT THING IS NOTHING SHORT OF INNOCENT!" The banshee again
sounded.</P><P>"YEAH
THAT THING KILLED BY BROTHER AND WIFE!" One man shouted.</P><P>"<I>These
people are blinded by rage."</I>
The man thought.</P><P>"I
see then there is only one thing to do then." He said. Many people
started cheering, that is until the man put his hand on the stomach
of the pink haired one and she fell over dead.</P><P>"Hey
you idiot what did you do to her!" Another man yelled.</P><P>"This."
Was all he said before he tackled the man sat on his chest and
stabbed his neck with now revealed hidden blade. "Is there anyone
else that would like to die tonight?" He said in an eerily calm
tone of voice while releasing a rather large amount of KI (A/N
Killing Intent.) focused directly on them. Many of them literally
pissed them selves and ran while the others just simply ran.</P><P>"I
suppose I'd better get you to hospital." He said as he picked up a
passed out Naruto and took him to the hospital.</P><P>/Twenty
eight hour (SLAP!) SORRY SORRY! Two Days Later./</P><P>Naruto
woke up with nothing short of a terrible headache. At first all he
saw was white that was when realization dawned on him. He was in the
hospital. Again.</P><P>"Oh
Naruto-kun your awake, you've been asleep for two days."</P><P>Naruto
tried to greet the old man Hokage but found that he had no voice.</P><P>"I'm
sorry Naruto but the doctors said that when you throat was cut your
voice box was very badly damaged and that it would take at least five
months for it to heal." Sarutobi spoke with no little amount of
sadness in his voice. "But enough with the sad things, how would
you like to meet the person that saved your life."</P><P>Naruto
still a little down trodden simply settled for small nod as an
affirmative.</P><P>"Alright
you may come in now!" Sarutobi called out and no sooner that he
called out did a man come in that young Naruto could only describe as
scary. He was a man of average height, he also wore a hood that cover
the top part of his head but you could clearly still see his face and
from the looks of it he was only about twenty or twenty-one. His eyes
were a dark brown that had a very calm but stern look to them, and
his face was no different in the stern sense. The outfit he was
wearing was as white as the hospital itself except for his boots and
gloves that is witch were a leather brown color. The rest of well the
short and easy way to put it, he looked like he was about to start a
war, the reason you ask? Well he had a simple long sword strapped to
his left hip, a large belt around his abdomen that held several
throwing knives, and last but not least a short blade strapped to his
back positioned for easy access.</P><P>"So
this is the boy huh... yes he looks quite strong and has a lot of
potential. My name is Altair, and from what Hokage-sama has told me
you must be Naruto. I'm very sorry that I did not step in sooner than
I did I could have prevented most of your injuries." Altair said
sternly but with a hint of sadness in his voice.</P><P>"Yes
but down to business. Please sign here sir." Sarutobi handed Altair
a piece of paper and a pen and then he signed his name where he was
told to.</P><P>"Congratulations,
you are now a shinobi of Konoha and official guardian of one Uzumaki
Naruto and as suck your new name is Uzumaki Altair and here are the
new keys to your new apartment."</P>

</B>Jutsus</P><P>/In
the Hospital/</P><P>Naruto
just sat there completely stunned. After all who wouldn't be if
someone you just met and saved your life just adopted you right out
the blue! <I>'Did
Ojisan just say th-that h-he is m-my O-Ot-Otousan!?'</I></P><P>Naruto
thought wide eyed to himself again completely shocked that is
until...</P><P>"Ano...
Hokage-sama is my musuko alright?" Altair asked a little concerned
that his new son is just sitting there. "He isn't saying anything."
At that the Hokage flinched remembering Naruto's unfortunate
condition.</P><P>"I'd
hate to be the bearer of bad news Altair-san, but due to one of
Naruto's injuries it will be a few months before he is able to talk
again." Sarutobi answered in a sad tone.</P><P>"Ah,
I see well as long as he heals all will be fine I suppose." He said
with his normal stern voice however if you listened closely enough
you could here some sadness in his voice.</P><P>However
in one fell swoop the tense atmosphere was broken with a certain
blond haired future Hokage</P><P>tackling
his new Otousan and hugging him tightly, almost as if he let go he
would disappear forever.</P><P>"Okay
okay Naruto get off." Altair said trying to stifle a chuckle... and
failing miserably. Needless to say the aged Hokage was a bit shocked
that the man that he perceived to be another version Hiashi (A/N
Shudders) was actually showing some emotion. After a good thirty
minutes of happy tears from Naruto and a few more chuckles from
Altair they finally left to see their new home.</P><P>/Streets
of Konoha, The Shinobi District/</P><P>Naruto
and Altair were walking towards the complex that held their new home
with Naruto was getting many hate filled glares and no one seemed to
acknowledge Altair's presence. One unlucky villager had the gall to
throw something at him. Needless to say that didn't work...</P><P>/Flashback/</P><P><I>'So
from what the Hokage told me Naruto here has a demon sealed within
him, and one the most powerful to boot... I guess that's why the
villagers hate him so...'</I>
He wasn't able to finish the thought when he heard the call of..</P><P>"HEY
DEMON SPAWN TAKE THIS!!" A stray villager yelled as he threw a sake
bottle at the young blond. This however did not go unnoticed or
unpunished by his new Otousan. The bottle was caught and crushed.</P><P>"Naruto
stay here and let me take care of him." Altair whispered to his new
son.</P><P>Naruto
couldn't stop him before he left without a trace. The next thing he
knew his Otousan was next to him again telling him to hurry up. The
last thing he saw was a crowd of villagers around a dead man with a
stab wound in the back of his neck asking what happened to him and
others saying he just dropped dead out of no where. He turned to ask
his Otousan what happened when he just shook his head no and they
kept moving.</P><P>/Flashback
End/</P><P>After
a few more minutes of walking, and a bit of 'gentle persuasion' with
the landlord to lower the rent they got to their new apartment. It
wasn't anything that special to Altair, however for Naruto it
was.(A/N Living in an orphanage that hated you and on the street
would do that.) In the living room there was a large and slightly
curved couch in front of a coffee table and a strange box on top of a
stand, (A/N In Altair's POV it was at least.) there was also kitchen
connected to the living room the fridge was already fully stocked
with food meaning the Hokage was here. There was another strange box
(A/N Microwave) a stove and a dinner table. They made their way to
the bedrooms and found notes on both their doors that read.</P><P><I>Dear
Altair and Naruto,</I></P><P><I>I
the Hokage have taken the liberty of getting you new clothes I knew
what Naruto liked but you Altair I had no Idea... so I just got you
the same outfit you're wearing now.</I></P><P>At
this Altair simply grunted an approval and Naruto laughed inaudible.
(A/N Remember he still doesn't have his voice back that includes his
laugh.)</P><P><I>Also
I assume that you've found the apartment suitable to your needs?
Good.</I></P><P><I>Best
Wishes,</I></P><P><I>Sarutobi
The Third Hokage</I></P><P><I>P.S.
Altair I would like to see you tomorrow for skill and placement test
concerning your position as a shinobi.</I></P><P><I>'That
was certainly considerate of the elder one.'</I>
Thought Altair. "Musuko I would like you to go change clothes go to
bed." Was all Altair said before he turned in for the night... and
came back out to tell Naruto good night and mumbled an almost
inaudible I love you but Naruto heard.. that is before he went into
his room to change into some pajamas and falling into a very blissful
sleep.</P><P>/Three
Years Later/</P><P>It's
been three years now since that 'small' incident and Naruto hasn't
been happier. Over the course of two years Naruto was able to
accomplish one amazing feat... he saw Altair without his hood. Of
course after he did he decided it wasn't anything special, all it was
is that he had really short hair. One day however Altair had to
discuss something very important with our young blond friend...</P><P>/Flashback
One Year Ago/</P><P>"Naruto
what I'm about to tell you, you must never share with anyone else.
Not even the Hokage himself." Naruto could tell his father was
being a bit more serious then usual, judging by the slightly stricter
tone to his voice. "You see Naruto I'm part of a very secretive
organization, we only refer to ourselves as The Brotherhood. You see
we're an elite group of assassins bent on liberating this world of
people who commit evil deeds, and because I'm part of this group I'll
have to leave in a few years." At this Naruto started to get
slightly teary eyed. "Now, now don't cry Naruto. I'll only be
leaving after the first year of the academy is done, so I'll at least
be able to walk you there every day and I promise that I'll come back
to see you graduate." For the first time in years, Altair actually
hugged his adoptive son.</P><P>/Flashback
End/</P><P>Now
Naruto was six years old and it was his first day to the academy.</P><P>"Now
Naruto remember what I told you?" Asked Altair.</P><P>"Yes
Otousan, and it's to always follow the Shinobi's Creed." You see
over the years Altair has taught Naruto the way of the assassin. The
most important of witch was the teaching of the Assassins Creed.</P><P>However
since Naruto heard it he decided to make a Creed of his own, The
Shinobi's Creed. Also with a new way of life came a new look... and
some new equipment. Now Naruto was wearing a white trench coat that
went to his ankles and had the kanji for Creed on the back,(A/N Due
to the influence of Altair.) a black sleeveless zip up vest under it,
black ANBU style pants tucked into some shin high dark brown
boots,(A/N Think Altair's boots.) fingerless dark brown leather
gloves that went to about the middle of his forearm and the left one
had a hidden blade just like Altair's. Altair also gave him a katana
instead of a normal sword like his to hang on his left hip witch had
a black hilt with white wrapping and a normal golden guard while the
sheath was black as well, and again just like Altair he had a short
blade similar to his strapped to his back while Naruto's shuriken and
kunai pouch was strapped to his left bicep. However there was one
hidden piece to his entire outfit that catch anyone off guard... (A/N
Well besides it not being orange that is.) it is that all of it was
lined with chain mail.</P><P>"And
that is?"</P><P>"Always
use the shadows, never reveal your true ability unless necessary, and
never ever take the life of an innocent with out reason."</P><P>"That's
right now get going, good luck, and remember that first impressions
are everything."</P><P>"I
know I know Otousan. Don't worry so much." Naruto said walking off.
That is until...</P><P>"You
forgot your lunch." Said Altair with a blushing Naruto.(A/N Because
he's embarrassed.)</P><P>"Thanks."</P><P><I>'Sigh',
I'll never understand that kid.'</I></P>

Academy, The Shinobi District/</P><P>Naruto
was a bit nervous as he walked up to the reception desk of the
Academy. When the receptionist noticed him, she asked polity (A/N He
has his hood up, so that nobody will recognize him) "This your
first day sweetie?" Naruto nodded in reply as he did not know how
the receptionist would react to the sight of him.</P><P>"Your
class room is 101 with a Iruka-Sensei, don't worry he's a nice
man, just don't anger him", said the receptionist. With that in
mind, he decided to sneak into the classroom through the window.
<I>'What
better way is there to show them that they</I>
<I>are
amateurs'</I>,
he thought as he exited the academy.</P><P>When
he found the window to the right room, he noticed that all of the
seats were facing away from the from the direction of the windows.
<I>'Perfect'</I>,
he climbed in through the window and sat quietly at the back of the
room waiting for class to start (A/N I love showing people who are up
themselves their place).</P><P>A
few minutes later Iruka walked into the classroom, "Alright class
lets take a roll call to see if everybody is here."</P><P>"Aburame
Shino"</P><P>"Here",
replied a boy wearing a grey coat and sunglasses. This went on till
Iruka reached Naruto.</P><P>"Uzumaki
Naruto"</P><P>"Here
Sensei", replied a quiet voice from behind them, that caused the
rest of the students to jump out of their skin. When they had managed
to calm themselves down, they noticed that there was a bow wearing a
white coat sitting at the back of the class. Every one of them was
thinking along the lines of <I>'how'd
he get in, he wasn't in the room before we came in.'</I></P><P>Before
any of the nosier students could demand to know how he had gotten in,
Iruka started the lesson.</P><P>/End
of the Day, Streets of Konoha, The Shinobi District/</P><P>'<I>That
was a complete waste of time, all we did today was study the best way
to eliminate a target in a variety of situations without getting
caught, but some of the other students answers were just stupid,
especially the Uchiha's' </I>thought
Naruto as he walked home.</P><P>/Flashback/</P><P>"Alright
class, can anyone tell me what the best way is to eliminate the
target in a public place", asked Iruka.</P><P>"Yes,
Sasuke"</P><P>"You
use a jutsu such as the Great Fireball", said Sasuke.</P><P>"Wrong,
that would not only give away your position, but would also kill
anybody who is surrounding the target thus costing you your mission",
replied Iruka.</P><P>/Flashback
End/</P><P>As
soon as Naruto walked in the front door to his apartment, Altair
snuck up behind him and grabbed him in a headlock, "What have I
told you Naruto never let your guard down, so how was your first
day?"</P><P>"It
was alright, if a little boring", replied Naruto as he broke out of
Altair's hold on him.</P><P>"Well
you know it is necessary to become a Genin, now how about a little
training before dinner".</P><P>/Inside
Naruto's Mindscape/</P><P>A
deafening roar sounded inside of a dark forest as a primordial force
awakened. "<B>It
seems that I have a weak container that will just not do</B>".</P><P>/Six
Year Time Skip, The Academy, The Shinobi District/</P><P>Naruto's
time at the Academy was spent in much the same way, after his first
year at the Academy Altair did indeed leave for his homeland, though
Naruto did occasionally receive a letter every few months. He made
some friends and enemies at the Academy, the friends that he made
were Hyuga Hinata, Nara Shikamaru, Akimichi Chouji, Aburame Shino and
Inuzuka Kiba. He tried to make friends with the rest of the class but
they either believed that he was a demon child or hated him because
he was tying with Sasuke for the Best Student of the Year.</P><P>He
also noticed that over the past six years that his strength, speed,
senses, reflexes and stamina had greatly increased as he aged.
Another surprising discovery was that his appearance was changing
slightly. His hands appeared to be changing into claws, his eyes
gained a feral look, his canine teeth grew longer, his ears were
changing into a canine shape as well as sprouting white fur, but the
most shocking change was that nine white fox tails were growing out
of his spine. Now he didn't think that this was normal so he went
to the Hokage who out a seal on them that rendered them invisible,
the seal would be taken off when Naruto thought he was ready.</P><P>"Alright
class today is the day of the Genin exams, you will wait here until
you name is called then you will enter through this door here",
said Iruka as the class sat down.</P><P>This
went on until…</P><P>"Uzumaki
Naruto"</P><P>Naruto
entered the room where the test was being held. "Bunshin, Please".
Naruto created three bunshin.</P><P>"Replacement,
Please" Naruto switched himself with Mizuki-Sensei.</P><P>"Excellent
and finally Transformation", Naruto transformed into Altair.</P><P>"Congratulations
Naruto you pass".</P><P>"Alright
everybody who passed will you please come again tomorrow to meet your
teams, while I will see the rest of you next year", said Iruka as
the class left the room.</P><P>/The
Next Day, The Academy, The Shinobi District/</P><P>'<I>I
hope my team will be alright'</I>
thought Naruto as entered the room to see the rest of the students
who passed.</P><P>Iruka
suddenly appeared through the door right behind him. "Excellent,
now that you are all here, I will be telling you your team placements
now".</P><P>"Team
Seven will be Uchiha Sasuke, Sakura Haruno", a squeal was heard
"and Seta Akane, your Jonin Sensei will be Hatake Kakashi".</P><P>"Team
Eight will be Aburame Shino, Hyuga Hinata and Inuzuka Kiba, you Jonin
Sensei will be Yuuhi Kurenai".</P><P>"Team
Ten will be Akimichi Chouji, Nara Shikamaru and Ino Yamanaka, your
Jonin Sensei will be Sarutobi Asuma".</P><P>Naruto
asked "What about me Sensei?"</P><P>"You
failed, Dobe". (A/N Go on guess)</P><P>Iruka
sent Sasuke a glare "The reason that you are not on a team Naruto
is because that somebody specifically asked to train you".</P><P>"Why
does the dobe get one-on-one training Sasuke-Kun deserves it",
screamed the howler monkey with pink fur.</P><P>"Enough
Sakura, Naruto is getting one-on-one training because there was no
room left on any of the active teams", shouted Iruka back at
Sakura.</P><P>"Who
is my Jonin Sensei, Iruka-Sensei", Naruto asked.</P><P>"Your
Sensei is…"</P><P>Be
gentle this is the first time I have ever posted anything that I will
stick to, constructive criticism is welcomed, but people who have
nothing better to do then complain about everything are not welcome</P><P>Who
should Naruto's Sensei be, please tell me. I have an idea in mind
but I want to hear my reader's thoughts.</P>

is…," Iruka was interrupted before he could finish.</P><P>"Me," said a tall,
brown haired man who held a senbon in his mouth, "come along gaki,
I'll introduce myself when we get to training ground 6". Naruto
and his new Sensei left the classroom.</P><P>"Alright, for the
rest of you, your Sensei's will be here shortly," said Iruka as
he left the room to hand his reports into the Hokage.</P><P>'<I>Damn I missed his
graduation, oh well I'll just have to make it up to him tonight,'
</I>thought a white robed individual that was hiding outside the
classroom window.</P><P>/Training Ground Six/</P><P>"Alright gaki, I'll
introduce myself then I want you to do it, My name is Shiranui
Genma. My likes are senbon and improving my techniques, which include
senbon. My dislikes are people who are uptight and underestimate
others. My dream for the moment, is to turn you into are true
shinobi", said the now identified Genma.</P><P>"My Name is Naruto
Uzumaki, my likes are practicing my skills that my adoptive father
taught me and practicing genjutsu when I have the time. My dislikes
are are people who are arrogant because they have an ability or skill
that others do not have and finally my dream is to become head of the
assassination squad", replied Naruto.</P><P>"Ok now usually you
would be forced to do the bell test, which most Genin teams only have
a 33% chance of passing, however seeing as you do not have any
team-mates, I want you to sneak into training ground Seven and steal
Hatake Kakashi's Icha Icha Paradise without revealing your
presence", said Genma.</P><P>"But that's
impossible, Hatake is basically fused with that book," retorted
Naruto in outrage.</P><P>"Well its either that
or having to return to the Academy," Genma said slyly knowing that
would force the Blonde-haired gaki to agree. Naruto just nodded his
head to show that he agreed and jumped off into the surrounding
greenery in the direction of training ground Seven.</P><P>/The Hokage Tower, The
Shinobi District/</P><P>The Hiruzen Sarutobi
was at his desk facing the greatest enemy of all time (Paper Work,
how I hate thee) when he felt a presence enter the room, it was well
hidden but he wasn't a Kage for nothing. "Reveal yourself ," he
ordered. A white-robed individual suddenly shimmered into existence.</P><P>"Hokage-sama, I see
that you still haven't managed to defeat the dreaded paper work,"
mocked the individual.</P><P>"Altair? Is that
you?" asked a shocked Hokage.</P><P>"Of course it is, you
didn't think that I would return? How is my son going anyway?"
asked Altair.</P><P>"He is going fine,
though you should know that he has changed a little".</P><P>"What changes?"</P><P>"I think that the
Kyuubi has changed him on the genetic level as he now has superior
physical abilities as well as some fox-like physical attributes,"
said Hiruzen as he informed Altair of Naruto's enhancements.</P><P>"I'm sure that he's
fine, he's had them for nearly six years now, so onto the next
order of business, on my missons throughout the world I heard of a
very interesting man, a certain Yondaime Hokage, a Arashi Kazama (A/N
I know that the Yondaime is really called Minato but this is my story
so NNYYAAHH)," spoke a white-robed assassin in a eerily calm voice
that started to make the Hokage to sweat.</P><P>"R-really w-w-what
did you hear," asked a slightly scared Hokage, he did not once
forget how dangerous the man infront of him was.</P><P>"About his
description, he sounds remarkably a lot like my son doesn't he,
want to explain that to me".</P><P>"Naruto is Arashi's
son alright, but you must not tell him that, as Arashi has made a lot
of enemies in the other hidden villages, especially Iwa, they would
not give up a chance to kill him," Hiruzen said as Altair watched
him closely.</P><P>"Fine, but when he
becomes a Chunin I will tell him who his biological father is," and
with that last note Altair left the office and the Hokage let out a
breath that he didn't know that he was holding in.</P><P>/Traning Ground Seven/</P><P>'<I>Now where is that
silver haired teme, ah there he is,' </I>thought Naruto as he saw
Kakashi sitting in the middle of the training ground reading his
porno book. <I>'What a bloody pervert, hmmm maybe I can use this to
my advantage'. </I> (A/N Kakashi is going to be like Jiraiya in
this regard). Naruto decided that he would quietly make two Kage
Bunshins and have them Henge into Yuuhi Kurenai and Mitarashi Anko.
The clones would then go ahead and start to loudly make out with each
other just outside of Kakashi's radius of hearing, and when he came
over to investigate, the clones would the throw a large amount of
kunai (he would henge into one and hide amongst the many).</P><P>'<I>Where are those
moans coming from, I must know,' </I>thought Kakashi as he headed
in the direction of the sounds, what he came across was something
that he would remember for the rest of his days, a very naked Anko
and Kurenai WERE FRENCHING right in front of him. Suddenly a twig
snapped right under his foot and the two kunoichi faced him <I>'Oh
Bugger' </I>The two kunoichi the pulled an ungodly amount of Kunai
seemingly out of the air and threw them at him. Kakashi hauled ass ut
he was still struck by many of the sharp weapons.</P><P>/Three Minutes Later,
Training Ground Six/</P><P>'<I>I cant believe
that actually worked' </I>thought Naruto as he raced away from the
Scene of the crime. He could of sworm though that he heard somebody
scream MY PRECIOUS. Naruto returned to Genma who passed him and told
him to meet him back here in three days for training.</P><P>/The Uzumaki's
Apartment, The Shinobi District/</P><P>Naruto arrived home to
find that his door was slightly ajar, so he unsheathed his long sword
and knife. As he entered the apartment he saw Altair standing in the
middle of the living room.</P><P>"OTOU-SAN" cried
Naruto has he leapt and hugged Altair who hugged him back.</P><P>"Hey Naruto," said
Altair happily before he became serious, "Naruto I think it is time
that you officially joined the Brotherhood".</P><P>XOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXOXO</P><P>There we have another
