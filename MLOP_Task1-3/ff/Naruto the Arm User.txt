Naruto or Mar (put the two dots over the a) Heaven</p><P>"Damn I failed
again," Naruto says as he sat down on a swing in the academy
playground.</p><P>"You know you can
still pass… all you just need to do is get this one scroll for me,"
Naruto heard Mizuki said over his shoulder.</p><P>"Why should I? This
is my third failure… I don't think I should even become a ninja
now," Naruto said as he looked down.</p><P>"Aw come on Naruto
it's an easy pass… and you'll learn a super cool technique from
this scroll. Don't worry too much because it's a secrete way to
pass so don't worry if some ninja come after you," Mizuki said
hoping to raise Naruto's spirits.</p><P>"…Fine I'll do
it," Naruto said as he stood up and left the area.</p><P>"Hehehe finally time
to get out of this crappy village," Mizuki said as he disappeared
also.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So this is the
stupid scroll that Mizuki asked for me to bring," Naruto said as he
looked at a huge scroll in the Hokage's office.</p><P>"Yes it is Naruto…
but why would you need this?" Sarutobi asked.</p><P>"Gah… this is not
good must use tactics… <U>Orike no Jutsu,</U>(Spelling)" Naruto
shouted as he transformed into his girl form.</p><P>"Gahh…." Sarutobi
let out as blood squirted from his nose.</p><P>"K.O." Naruto
shouted as he took the huge scroll and left. "Why would anyone want
to keep everything in a scroll like this?" Naruto asked as he
continued on to his favorite spot in the woods.</p><P>"<B>Interesting…
the brat might learn something from this," Kyuubi said from her
cage. </B></p><P>"What's this…
Kage Bunshin no Jutsu? That seem's easy enough," Naruto said as
he continued reading the scroll. "Ehh how do I do this technique?"
naruto asked no one in particular as he channeled his chakra and
tried to complete his technique.</p><P>"<B>Baka… he's
just channeling his chakra not controlling it… at that rate he
won't be even able to create one clone… I wonder how he even does
his henge?" Kyuubi thought as she watched him continue. </B></p><P>"Gah this is
frustrating," Naruto shouted as he sat down after his 19th
try.</p><P>"<B>Try channeling
your chakra slower and not as quickly as before… Also mold your
chakra into your fingers more to bring out the technique," Naruto
heard Kyuubi say in his head. </B></p><P>"Ehh scary voice!!!
Oh well this is what people must say about trusting the voice inside
of you," Naruto said as he stood up and tried his technique again.
"<U>Kage Bunshin no Jutsu</U>," Naruto shouted creating 2 copies
of himself.</p><P>"Hey me," one of
the clones said in front of Naruto.</p><P>"Eh me?" Naruto
asked as he looked at himself.</p><P>"Yup I'm you and
he's you… we're all you!" the first clone said as he raised
his arms up to exclaimed his idea.</p><P>"…are you sure
you're me?" the real Naruto asked as he stared at the first one.</p><P>"Yup," the 1st
clone exclaimed as he went over to Naruto and put his arm around his
neck.</p><P>"Am I really related
to this guy?" the 2nd clone asked as he looked over at
the 1st.</p><P>"Oh well… time to
practice some more," the real Naruto said as he started to channel
some more chakra.</p><P>"Hmm this is a weird
scroll ehh," the 1st clone said as he looked it over.</p><P>"I'll say it even
has our name on it," the 2nd clone said as he pointed at
one section of the scroll.</p><P>"Ehhh you can't be
serious can you?" the real Naruto said as he created another clone
before rushing over to the scroll.</p><P>"We're serious
see," the 2nd clone said as he pointed to the part that
had his name on it.</p><P>"That's strange?
Who would send something to me?" Naruto asked as he started to read
the scroll.</p><P><I>Dear Naruto</I></p><P><I>Hey how's things
for ya… although I don't think I should really be asking you this
because of your situation. I'll save your situation for later. For
now let me ask you, have you ever had dreams where you are in a world
not of ours; something that is beyond reality that you want to visit.
Well if you are my son then you probably have experienced some of
those dreams… most likely over a 100 times. Well to explain why
I've been babbling on for a few sentences I'll just say that
those dreams are real. </I></p><P>"Ehhh?!?!?! You gotta
be kidding me," Naruto said as he stopped reading.</p><P>"That would be
exciting if we could go to that world ourselves," the 1st
clone said as he stood thoughtfully.</p><P>"Let's just keep on
reading. We might find something good," the 2nd clone
said as he urged Naruto to read on further.</p><P><I>Those dreams you
keep on having are of another world one called Mar Heaven. It's a
totally different world from where we, or you are right now. To
explain why I'm talking of this world called Mar Heaven… I'll
just say it now I want you to go there. Last time I was there, there
was a war going on which I participated in but the war ended in a
draw. Seeing nothing else I could do I left after the mourning of the
hero's that died in the war. I felt guilty just leaving the world
with nothing done so that is one of the reasons I want you to go to
Mar Heaven in case Chess comes back. Oh yeah I forgot to mention,
Chess pieces were the bad side to the war and the Cross guard was the
team I was in… basically the good side. We suffered many losses on
our side… and 2 deaths 2 strange but strong men an off worlder like
me and a farmer. Now about jumping this world to Mar Heaven use the
ring attached to the scroll. As for the 2 other Arm's attached use
the one that has a Wolf on it. I at least hope you can activate it…
if you can Rush should help you with everything else. To activate the
Arm though you have to channel your mana force something like chakra
into the chain and just call out </I><I><U>Dimension Arm: Rush</U></I><I>
and the rest should work. Well I just hope you can help me alleviate
the pain I've been feeling ever since I ran away… Make me proud.</I></p><P><I>P.S. I don't know
how to say this but… I was the fourth hokage that sealed the Kyuubi
inside of you… I am truly sorry and I know nothing I do will ever
get your forgiveness. Sorry for being such a selfish father.</I></p><P><I>From your Dad</I></p><P><I>Namikaze Minato.</I></p><P>"…So we do have a
dad," the 1st Naruto said in shock.</p><P>"Obviously how else
would we have been born?" the 2nd Naruto said.</p><P>"Hmm… I always
thought that I came from the stork like everyone else," the real
Naruto said making the 2nd do a face plant onto the
ground.</p><P>"Gah… how are we
even the same?" the 2nd asked before looking at the
scroll. "So I wonder where the 3 Arms are?" the 2nd
asked as he looked over the scroll.</p><P>"Maybe we have to
touch that circle?" the real Naruto asked as he went and touched
the circle at the middle of the scroll.</p><P>"Now how would that
be possible?" the 1st asked as the real Naruto touched
the scroll.</p><P>Poof "It worked,"
Naruto said as he saw a ring, some kind of chain, and a weird
bracelet. "So my father said to channel mana or something like that
into the chain like thing right?" Naruto said as he started to
channel his chakra into the chain.</p><P>"But the scroll said
mana not…" the 2nd clone said only to be stopped by
the real Naruto yelling.</p><P>"<U>Guardian Arm:
Rush</U>," Naruto yelled expecting something to happen. For a
second nothing happened until the chain started to glow before smoke
covered the whole area.</p><P>"Bah Minato it's
been 6 years since you used me so why now?" A voice came from the
smoke cloud. A few seconds later all three Narutos saw in front of
them a silver wolf twice as tall as Naruto and 3 times longer.</p><P>"It's a really huge
doggy!" the 1st clone shouted as he saw what was in
front of him.</p><P>"… isn't that a
wolf?" the 2nd clone corrected the first.</p><P>"Still looks like a
huge doggy," the 1st said as he stared at Rush.</p><P>"Eh? Where's
Minato? He's the only one with my arm so he's the only one that
could've summoned me," Rush said as he stared down at the 3
Naruto's.</p><P>"If you're talking
about Namikaze Minato he's my dad… although I just learned about
it today and it feels weird calling him my dad," Naruto explained
to the wolf.</p><P>"I see… then where
is Minato?" Rush asked once again.</p><P>"Umm… I'm not
sure about that… but if my dad is really the fourth hokage then he
is dead for all I know," Naruto said the last part slowly.</p><P>"I see, so Minato did
accomplish his dream before dieing," Rush said thoughtfully.</p><P>"His dream?" Naruto
asked in a puzzled tone.</p><P>"His dream was to
become the 4th Hokage which he did. I'm proud of that
boy," Rush said as he lifted his head in pride. "Boy if you're
his son did you ever have dreams of Mar Heaven? Also why do I smell
part fox in you?" Rush asked</p><P>"Well for the Mar
heaven part, yes I have been having dreams about that place… mostly
when I sleep during class," Naruto said as he rubbed the back of
his head. "As for the part fox… if I'm correct my dad sealed
Kyuubi inside of me which is a giant fox that… that… I stopped
paying attention after the 9 tailed fox part," Naruto said causing
everyone to fall on the ground.</p><P>"Baka… you're
just like Minato… man like father like son as they say," Rush
said as he shook his head. "So you wanna go to Mar heaven?" Rush
finally asked in a serious voice which sent chills down the 3
Naruto's backs.</p><P>"Can we?" the real
asked as the two others just stood there.</p><P>"I guess I can if we
have the Arm <U>Gate watcher clown</U>," Rush began saying.</p><P>"Can you use an Arm?"
Naruto asked in surprise.</p><P>"Well… normally
guardians can't use Arms… but I'm a special arm so I'm able
to use them. As for why… I'm not sure why but I think Minato
knew," Rush said as he put on a pensive face.</p><P>"Well my dad just
left us 3 arms… as you say one of them was you while the other two
are a bracelet and a weird ring," Naruto said as he showed Rush the
two remaining arms.</p><P>"That's it!!!"
Rush shouted as he looked at the ring in Naruto's hand. "<U>Monban
Piero</U>(Gate watcher clown)… Minato must have had another one…
which I can't believe," Rush said as he started to glow. "Another
reason why I'm a special arm is because of this," Rush said as
the light grew brighter causing the 3 Naruto's to close their eyes.</p><P>"What happened?"
All three Naruto's asked as they opened their eyes to see an
amazing sight in front of them. In front of them stood a man in a man
in a silver coat and bamboo hat. He was about 6 ft tall and had
yellow eyes which seemed to glow. (1)</p><P>"I see you're
amazed by my new appearance," Rush said as he extended his arm (a
body limb not the weapon). "Now give me the <U>Monban Piero</U>,"
Rush demanded which Naruto complied to. "We have company," Rush
said as he put his arm back looking towards the tree behind him.</p><P>"Who are you?"
Iruka asked as he came down from the tree.</p><P>"A friend of
Naruto's," Rush said as he pointed over to the 3 Naruto's.</p><P>"Is this a trick?
Because Naruto can't do a bunshin," Iruka said as he stood shell
shocked by the sight in front of him.</p><P>"How mean
Iruka-sensei… anyway this isn't bunshin it's <U>Kage Bunshin</U>,"
All three said as they gave a thumbs up position to Iruka.</p><P>"<U>K-K-Kage
Bunshin</U>?!" Iruka shouted in shock and surprise.</p><P>"Yup and it was
easy," Naruto said shocking Iruka even more.</p><P>"Well anyway Naruto…
Why did you steal the Forbidden Scroll?" Iruka asked as he punched
all three Naruto's on the head. Surprisingly all three stayed.</p><P>"How mean," the
real said.</p><P>"Iruka-sensei…"
the 1st clone said.</p><P>"Mizuki sensei told
us to steal the scroll and learn a technique from it," the 2nd
clone finished.</p><P>"How… never mind
that for now. Why would Mizuki ask you to steal…" Iruka began
only to jump back when Rush said jump.</p><P>"We have another
visitor," Rush said as he looked at the giant shuriken which stood
where Iruka was before.</p><P>"Well I see you found
Naruto for me Iruka," Mizuki said as he took off another shuriken
from his back. "Let's see you dodge this time," Mizuki said as
he threw the shuriken which went straight at the 3 Narutos.</p><P>"I don't think so,
<U>Weapon Arm: Moon Shards,</U>" Rush yelled as he extended his
right arm to his side. Soon the bracelet on his arm shined before
turning into rhombus like shards which floated around Rush. "Guard,"
Rush shouted causing the shards to converge in front of Naruto
forming a moon like shield, which deflected the shuriken.</p><P>"Nani? What kind of
weapon is that?" Mizuki asked as he looked at the shards breaking
up to surround Rush again.</p><P>"A weapon that will
defeat you," Rush said as the pointed his finger at Mizuki. "2
strikes," Rush said causing the shards to form 2 fairly large
rhombus's which went straight at Mizuki.</p><P>"Crap," Mizuki said
as he jumped up to dodge the attack.</p><P>"Stupid," Rush said
as he pointed his finger up to point at Mizuki's new location.
Receiving the new orders the 2 shards went straight for Mizuki's
new location.</p><P>"What kind of weapon
does this?" Mizuki asked as he jumped from tree to tree.</p><P>"Split," Rush said
causing the 2 rhombus's to go in different directions surrounding
Mizuki.</p><P>"You left Naruto
open," Mizuki said as he drew a 3 kunai's and threw them each at
a different Naruto.</p><P>"As if I would leave
Naruto open," Rush said as he extended his left arm towards Naruto.
"<U>Dimension Arm: Wind Cutter," </U>Rush said as the 3 kunai's
were sliced in half by some wind.</p><P>"Nani?" Mizuki
shouted as he saw the 3 kunai's deflected by wind.</p><P>"Time for me to
shine," Naruto said as he finally decided to take some action.
"<U>Kage Bunshin no Jutsu</U>," the three Naruto's shouted
creating more then a 100 copies of Naruto around Mizuki. "This is
payback Mizuki," the real Naruto shouted as all the clones charged
in causing serious pain for Mizuki.</p><P>A huge beating later.</p><P>"Looks like I wasn't
even needed for this battle," Rush said as he put his Arm's back
to where they were.</p><P>"That was actually
easy… especially with my clones," Naruto said as the clones gave
a shout of enthusiasm before disappearing. "So when are we going?"
Naruto asked as he faced Rush.</p><P>"Going, going where
Naruto?" Iruka asked as he felt something that was going to impact
him happen soon.</p><P>"Well… I figured
this world had enough of Naruto so I'm off to another one with
Rush's help," Naruto said as Rush put the dimension arm on his
index finger.</p><P>"You can't go…
what of your friends and everybody that cares for you?" Iruka asked
trying to get Naruto to have second thoughts.</p><P>"The only one's
that I consider closer to me is you and the Hokage… so I don't
have much bonds holding me in this world… if I can though I'll
try to return," Naruto said as Rush activated the Arm causing a
huge gate to appear with a weird clown on it.</p><P>"The dice says 2 so
only 2 can enter," a weird clown said as it stared at the 3 there.</p><P>"Come on Naruto let's
go," Rush said as the gate started to open.</p><P>"Wait Naruto, before
you go I have something to give you," Iruka said getting Naruto to
come over to him. "Close your eyes Naruto," Naruto complied and
soon felt something on his forehead. "Congratulations on becoming a
Konoha Genin… you better come back," Iruka said as he felt Naruto
hug him.</p><P>"Thank you
Iruka-sensei… I'm sure I'll be back," Naruto said as he
headed toward the gate.</p><P>"I wonder where we'll
end up," Rush said as he and Naruto entered the gate.</p><P>"Hope that world is
ready for someone like you Naruto," Iruka said as the gate
disappeared leaving him alone with Mizuki. "Hey where's the
scroll?" Iruka asked as he realized that there was no more scroll
here.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Where are we?"
Naruto asked as he opened his eyes to see a vast open plain in front
of him.</p><P>"I'm not sure also…
although right now that doesn't matter much… I need to just train
you right now so you'll be able to use Arms," Rush said as he
walked up behind Naruto.</p><P>"But I only have 1
more Arm left… and I'm not even sure what it does," Naruto said
as he pulled out the bracelet from his pocket. The bracelet had a
lightning bolt on it with yellow jewels encrusted on it.</p><P>"I haven't seen
that Arm in a long time. <U>Dimension Arm: Hirashin,</U>" Rush said
in awe as he examined the arm in Naruto's hand.</p><P>"What does it do?"
Naruto asked getting interested.</p><P>"Well this particular
Arm causes time to slow down and then the user is able to move at
insane speeds using the winds around him… sort of like a vortex to
a certain point," Rush said as he stared at the arm some more.
"Minato got this Arm when he was in Kaldea. It was made directly
for him so normally only he should be able to use it… although you
might be able to use it,"</p><P>"So how do I use it?"
Naruto asked.</p><P>"Well you have to
channel your mana into the Arm to get out the effect. To get a longer
effect you just have to just increase your mana stores which you can
do with training. As for the training don't worry I'll supervise
your training… but seeing how long you kept me out you have a
pretty large mana store," Rush stated.</p><P>"<B>That's all
because of me!" Naruto heard a voice inside of him say causing him
to</B> <B>stop still.</B></p><P>"Did you here that?"
Naruto asked Rush who just shook his head.</p><P>"<B>Only you can here
me baka… and as you should know I'm inside you," the voice said
again causing Naruto to scratch his head.</B></p><P>"Ok this is just
weird," Naruto said as he looked around.</p><P>"<B>Fine we'll just
have a face to face talk," the voice inside of him said before
Naruto passed out while Rush was holding onto his arm. </B></p><P>"Where am I?"
Naruto asked as he looked around.</p><P>"<B>We're in your
mind… and I've been living in here for 12 years," Naruto heard
a giant fox say behind huge bars. </B></p><P>"Who are you?"
Naruto asked causing the giant fox to growl.</p><P>"<B>Bah… didn't
you just read that you had me The Great Kyuubi inside of you?"
Kyuubi asked as she started to get annoyed. </B></p><P>"Kyuubi… who was
that again?" Naruto asked causing Kyuubi to facefault.</p><P>"<B>Haven't you
paid attention in class… oh wait you didn't… oh well all you
just need to know for now I'm inside of you," Kyuubi said as she
lied down on her paws.</B></p><P>"Are you always so
big?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"<B>I guess this form
is too big for a mortal like you… oh well I guess I'll show you
my other form," Kyuubi said as she started to shrink in size before
she turned into a human. She seemed to be around 18 years old in a
red white kimono. She was about 5ft 7in with a DDcup. Her hair was
red and waist length, as for her eyes they were a bright green.</B></p><P>"Are you going to
gawk at me all day?" Kyuubi asked causing Naruto to turn away while
blushing.</p><P>"Sorry…" Naruto
said as he stared at the ground.</p><P>"Well anyway I heard
from outside conversations that you are in another world… as I
heard from the wolf also you'll be training. So I decided being the
great Kyuubi I would help you train," Kyuubi said as she stood
prideful.</p><P>"That's so cool!!!!
A new world and 2 great sensei's this is the best day for me ever,"
Naruto said.</p><P>"Well you should go
back to your body now because I think Rush is worried about you,"
Kyuubi said as Naruto started to disappear.</p><P>"Thank's
Kyuubi-chan," Naruto said as he disappeared.</p><P>"Heh… Kyuubi-chan I
haven't been called that since… I was with my parents," Kyuubi
said as a light blush appeared on her face.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Naruto… Naruto are
you alright?" Naruto heard Rush say as he came to.</p><P>"Yeah I'm fine…
I'm just meeting everyone close to me," Naruto said confusing
Rush.</p><P>"Who?" Rush asked.</p><P>"Just another
sensei," Naruto said before turning to Rush. "So when do we start
training?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"Let's start now,
<U>Dimension Arm: Training Zone</U>,"(2) Rush said as a door
appeared beneath both of them sending both of them to another area.</p><P>"Where are we?"
Naruto asked as he looked up to see a distorted sky. Around him were
just mountains and seemingly nothing else.</p><P>"This is a sub
dimension that I have. Here time will pass slower then when we were
in world outside, perfect for training," Rush said as he walked up
to Naruto. "First we'll start with basic warm-ups, first 1000
push-ups then 1000 sit-ups then keep on running across the mountains
until you reach here again," Rush said causing Naruto's jaw to
drop.</p><P>"I can't do that!"
Naruto exclaimed in shock.</p><P>"Don't worry we
have all the time we need," Rush said as he sat down. "Summon me
when you're done… just do what you did before to summon me,"
Rush said as he disappeared in a puff of smoke, in his place the
chain from before.</p><P>"Sadistic training
bastards," Naruto shouted as he started to do the warm-up.</p><P>"<B>It's all for
your good," Naruto heard Kyuubi say.</B></p><P>"Maybe I can skip a
few…" Naruto began to say.</p><P>"<B>No, if you do
I'll put your body in excruciating pain," Kyuubi said as she
smirked in her cage.</B></p><P>"As if," Naruto
said as he stopped his push-ups.</p><P>"<B>All right, but
you asked for it," Kyuubi said as she sent some of her chakra
through Naruto's system causing some pain. </B></p><P>"All right, I'm
doing it," Naruto said as he quickly resumed his push-ups.</p><P>"<B>That's better
boy," </B></p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>5 HOURS LATER</p><P>"My body… I can't
move," Naruto said as he finished his last mountain run.</p><P>"<B>Heh I see you
finished your first ever real warm-up," Kyuubi said as she leaned
on the bars of her cage.</B></p><P>"Yeah… but if
that's a warm-up what's next?" Naruto asked as he slowly
started to feel better.</p><P>"<B>Might as well
summon Rush to see… I'm a bit curious also what's in store for
us in this new world," Kyuubi said as she started to let her
curiosity get the better of her. </B></p><P>"Should I lift my arm
and summon Rush... I'm not sure it's a good," Naruto began only
to be stopped by a burst of chakra from Kyuubi.</p><P>"Gahh I'm doing it,
I'm doing it… let's see," Naruto said as he weakly stood up
and took the chain out and shouted "<U>Guardian Arm: Rush</U>,"
Naruto shouted while channeling something other then chakra into the
chain as he did before.</p><P>"Hmm… you must be a
natural at Arm's," Rush said as he appeared in his human form in
front of Naruto.</p><P>"Heh thanks,"
Naruto said as he rubbed the back of his head.</p><P>"Anyway I guess I
should explain the weapons we use in Mar heaven," Rush said as he
took off 2 rings, 1 bracelet with a silver circle on it, and a weird
skull necklace. "Although I don't have all the types of Arm's
this should do enough for an explaination," Rush said as he
motioned for Naruto to sit down.</p><P>"What do you mean by
different types of Arms?" Naruto asked in clearly confused.</p><P>"Well as you know I'm
an Arm… to be exact a Guardian Arm. Guardian Arm's summon a
guardian of some sort to help you in combat. Normally you can't
move too much when you summon a guardian. Then there's the
dimension Arms. You've seen Gate Keeper clown and also you've
seen this one in action Wind Cutter," Rush said as he showed Naruto
a ring which was shaped in a normal way with a white crystal in the
middle.</p><P>"Do all Arm's have
different shapes?" Naruto asked as he noticed the subtle
differences.</p><P>"Yes… no two Arm's
ever tend to be the same," Rush said as he continued with the
explanation. "As I saying before Dimension Arm's can do two
actions that I know so far. One is to transport someone or something
to another place. The second is to use wind attacks," Rush said as
he put on the ring. "<U>Dimension Arm: Wind Cutter</U>," Rush
shouted causing a blade of wind to come out from the ring and cut a
bit of Naruto's hair.</p><P>"Hey don't do
that," Naruto said as he looked at the part of hair that was cut.</p><P>"Well now onto
another type of Arm… hmm which one to explain," Rush said a he
stared at the other ring, rhombus, and the skull necklace.</p><P>"How about that one,"
Naruto said as he pointed to the necklace.</p><P>"<U>Darkness Arm:
Nerve Chill</U>, An Arm that I don't like to use that often… it
causes the one affected to slowly lose control of their nerves and
eventually stop moving… although such arm's don't come without
a consequence. Whenever the affect of the Arm is on I can't move
for 1 hour leaving me seriously open and defenseless… only to use
on 1 on 1 duels," Rush said as he put the Arm away. "Almost all
Darkness arms have a negative consequence on the owner as they do on
the one targeted," Rush said as he explained to Naruto.</p><P>"Scary… so have you
ever used that Arm?" Naruto asked as Rush put the necklace on
again.</p><P>"Twice… the 2nd
time I used it I almost got destroyed," Rush said shocking Naruto a
bit. "Well moving on this Moon shaped bracelet is my own personal
Weapon Arm. A Weapon Arm is just like a normal weapon which can be
summoned out at a battle. As you saw before my moon shard Arm's can
be used offensively and defensively not many arm's do that," Rush
said as Naruto remembered the battle with Mizuki and the use of the
arm.</p><P>"Cool," Naruto said
as he tried to touch the arm.</p><P>"No touching for
now…" Rush said a he put the ring back on. "Finally this other
ring is one of the Nature Arm's I have on. Nature Arm's can allow
the user to attack with one of the elements or strengthen you up,"
Rush said as he put the ring back on. "As for how to use the Arm's
you got a pretty good sense on how to… just use your mana force and
channel it to your Arm…" Rush said.</p><P>"Ok… chakra and
mana so confusing," Naruto said as he stood up.</p><P>"Don't worry… as
for now we'll just try to start you off one the Hirashin since we
have not other Arms… although it should take you a long time to
master it," Rush began to explain only to notice Naruto not by him
anymore.</p><P>"This arm is hard to
use," Naruto said as he tried activated activating the Hirashin
again.</p><P>'That kid…' Rush
thought as he saw Naruto move a bit faster then normal 10 meters in
front of him. 'Just like Minato,' Rush thought as he saw Naruto
attempt to use Hirashin again.</p><P>"Gahh this thing is
tiring me out too much," Naruto said as he fell down flat on his
back.</p><P>"<B>You tried hard…
although how did you know how to use an Arm in the first place?"
Naruto heard Kyuubi ask.</B></p><P>'I don't know… I
just have this feeling for some odd reason,' Naruto thought as he
lifted the Hirashin above his face.</p><P>"<B>Hmm… let me
check your chakra system for you while you practice… I might find
something," Kyuubi said as she waited.</B></p><P>"Alright time to go
again," Naruto said as he put Hirashin back on. "<U>Dimension
Arm: Hirashin</U>," Naruto shouted as he moved forward a bit
farther and faster this time, although he could still be seen from
the naked eye.</p><P>"<B>Strange… truly
strange…" Naruto heard Kyuubi say. </B></p><P>'What's strange?'
Naruto thought to Kyuubi.</p><P>"<B>Well I found
something else in your chakra system other then chakra… it might be
what Rush said… mana," Kyuubi said as she scratched her head. </B></p><P>'Is that bad?'
Naruto thought.</p><P>"<B>Well it might
explain why you couldn't do bunshin… because of your high chakra
stores and this weird source which messes up your ninjutsu… that
must be why your Kage bunshin's didn't dispel from a hit from
Iruka," Kyuubi said as she. </B></p><P>"Interesting…"
Naruto said as he noticed Rush stand next to him.</p><P>"Well… you're
doing good so far why don't we take a break now?" Rush asked.</p><P>"No… not right now
I feel like I can do some more," Naruto said as he used Hirashin
again, only this time he went further and created a small red blur.</p><P>'That kid's going
to be great,' Rush thought as he saw Naruto continue on practicing.
"<U>Guardian Arm: Floating Sprite</U>," Rush shouted creating a
small blue ball which floated in front of him. "I want you to find
out what's been happening," Rush told the floating blue ball
which disappeared. 'I wonder if Chess is acting up again?' Rush
thought as he looked in Naruto's direction only to see him
sleeping. "I guess he's been doing enough today," Rush thought
as the sprite came back. "That was quick as always… report,"</p><P>"Phantom is still
down and Chess is moving slowly… other then that this world is at
peace for now… too peaceful," the sprite said.</p><P>"Good job," Rush
said as he dismissed the sprite. "I guess I should go now as well,"
Rush said as he disappeared also.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So what are we
learning here?" Naruto asked Kyuubi.</p><P>"<B>Well what I'll
be teaching you today is chakra control… then you might be able to
use that Hirashin Arm a bit better," Kyuubi said as she stood by
the bars. </B></p><P>"It's a bit weird
to have a teacher on the other side of some bars," Naruto said as
he looked over at Kyuubi in her feminine glory at the other side of
the cage. Looking at her closely Naruto began to wonder why he even
like Sakura.</p><P>"<B>Well since this
is your mindscape you won't be doing the exercise physically… but
you should be able to do it outside once you learn. To do it walk
over to the bars for further instructions," Kyuubi said as she
watched Naruto walk over to her. "Ok now I want you to focus your
chakra to your feet then walk up the bars… but I wonder why did you
walk so close to the cage where I can attack you?" Kyuubi asked.</B></p><P>"Well… you seem
nicer then any of the other villagers… besides why would a
beautiful person like you be dangerous?" Naruto asked causing
Kyuubi to blush a bit.</p><P>"<B>I see… real
honest of you… well continue on with the exercise," Kyuubi said
as she watched Naruto. 'You are definitely interesting… I just
hope you stay this way so when I get out of this cage I can make you
my mate… nobody in the demon world could have a will stronger then
yours which didn't break under the pressure, besides if he's cute
now I wonder what he'll be like when he's older,' Kyuubi
thought as she saw Naruto fall down.</B></p><P>"I did it and now I'm
too tired," Naruto said as he fell down sleeping.</p><P>"<B>I guess I should
congratulate you for finishing," Kyuubi said as she used her tails
to pull Naruto in and put him in a comfortable position next to her. </B></p><P>A/N: Well here's a
new story by me and I'm sorry for not updating Craftknight. My mom
got in the way of my typing so I can't type to the hours I usually
do. Well this idea just happened to be in my head so I wrote about
it.</p><P>1: Got the idea from
the Guardian Arm puss in boots or something like that. It's Ginta's
guardian in Phantoms match.</p><P>2: Decided to do the
training gate dimension arm only a bit different.</p><P>Well as for Naruto in
the other world I decided to put it 1 year before Ginta comes… I'm
still not sure what I should do. I definitely will make Naruto go
back to Konoha. Other ideas I have is to make Naruto meet with some
of the main cast, or meet another OC… please give me ideas… maybe
on other Arms I can make because I can't think of much creative
ones… well. Pairings definitely he'll have Kyuubi but might add
someone else tell me…. Well…</p><P>READ AND REVIEW…….</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>"Normal,"</p><P>"<B>Occasional
Kyuubi,"</B></p><P>"­<U>Techniques/
Activate Arm,"</U></p><P>'Thinking,'</p><P>Disclaimer: I don own
Naruto or Mar (put the two dots over the a) Heaven</p><P>"So we can finally
get out of this stupid training gate?" Naruto asked as he stared up
at the weird sky.</p><P>"You've been in
here long enough… although only 5 months have passed outside it's
been about 4 years in here…" Rush said as he lifted up an Arm.
(Note I know the other training gate arm is 60 days but I'm setting
this one to 10 days per day…. So don't screw me up or anything.
Also I never saw Ginta change that much while in the training zone so
Naruto will still be around 12 yearish…)</p><P>"So where are we
going to go now?" Naruto asked as he saw Rush activate the Arm.</p><P>"We'll probably
just go around and train some more. Being in this training area is
too taxing for me and you," Rush said as he disappeared along with
Naruto.</p><P>Outside.</p><P>"Actual grass
amazing," Naruto says as he lies down on the field.</p><P>"Come on we had grass
in the training zone also," Rush said as he looked around.</p><P>"True but that grass
felt artificial and strange… besides there's an actual sky to
look up to now," Naruto said as he pointed to the clouds.</p><P>"Bah let's just get
going now… right now we're close to the thieves guild of Luberia…
not a type you want to get close to with the Arm you have with you
now," Rush said as he looked over at Naruto only to find him
missing. "Great… mentally he should be 16 years old but he still
acts like a child," Rush said as he followed after Naruto's
scent.</p><P>With Naruto</p><P>"Hmm… where am I?"
Naruto asked as he noticed he was no longer in a grassy plain but in
a rugged mountain terrain.</p><P>"<B>Great can't you
just obey a simple command for once?" Naruto heard Kyuubi say in
his head.</B></p><P>"Why should I…
after all what point is there of not exploring by myself?" Naruto
asked as he went deeper into the mountainous territory.</p><P>"<B>Jump back,"
Kyuubi suddenly yelled causing Naruto to obey.</B></p><P>"See I follow
orders," Naruto said as he saw a lightning bolt strike where he
was.</p><P>"That's quite a
rare arm you have there," a voice said coming from the rugged area
around Naruto.</p><P>"What Arm are you
talking about?" Naruto asked as he scratched his head.</p><P>"The one around your
arm," the guy said before he jumped down with 4 others.</p><P>"Well Rush said this
arm was custom made… although I don't see how you knew it was
rare," Naruto said as he stared at the 5 before him. Apparently the
one talking was their leader. He had on a bandana which covered most
of his eyes with blond hair. On both hands were 2 rings 2 which
seemed to match with each other.</p><P>"Well why don't you
hand it over now. We have you surrounded," the guy said as he
raised his left hand "<U>Weapon Arm: Griffin Lance,</U>" the guy
said causing one of the rings to turn into a lance.</p><P>"Can I at least get
the name of the one attacking me?" Naruto asked as he got into a
defensive stance.</p><P>"Nanashi, leader of
the Luberia guild… now hand over that Arm or else we'll force you
to," Nanashi said as the others around him pulled out swords and
spears.</p><P>"I see… I guess I
should spar to test out my skills," Naruto said as the flow of mana
changed around him.</p><P>"Get him," Nanashi
yelled as he charged at Naruto with his men.</p><P>"Idiots…" Naruto
said as he waited for them to enter his range. "1 down," Naruto
said as he grabbed the closet crony and threw him to the side of the
area, slamming him into the mountain.</p><P>"Don't be so cocky
boy," another one said as he used his lance to deliver short quick
jabs at Naruto.</p><P>"I'm not being
cocky," Naruto said as he defended himself both verbally and
physically. "See," Naruto said as he caught the spear stopping
the barrage of attacks. He then pulled the spear causing the owner to
come straight at Naruto. "Take this," Naruto yelled punching the
man straight down knocking him out.</p><P>"If we all attack him
at once we should be able to corner him in this region," Nanashi
said as he advanced.</p><P>"Hai," the
remaining two cronies said as they charged at Naruto with weird
looking swords.</p><P>"Take this," the
two said as they continuously attacked forcing Naruto into a corner.</p><P>"We got you now,
<U>Nature Arm: Electric Eye</U>," causing another lighting bolt
stronger then before to strike Naruto. "Direct hit," Nanashi said
as he smirked only to frown when in place of Naruto there was a human
shaped log. "What happened, another Arm?" Nanashi asked as he
looked around frantically.</p><P>"No it's a basic
skill for a ninja," Naruto said as on the mountainous region on the
side.</p><P>"How's he doing
that?" one of the men asked while the others tried to shake off
their shock.</p><P>"No matter we'll
still take his arm," Nanashi said as he started to run up to
Naruto, somehow managing not to fall down.</p><P>"Well… you should
know I haven't even used my arm yet, so you should know you are
outmatched," Naruto said as he jumped off the side. "<U>Kaze no
Yaiba</U>," Naruto shouted causing a blade of wind to form slicing
the two cronies at the bottom. "Don't worry I didn't hit any
vitas so they should be alright," Naruto said as he looked at the
furious expression on Nanashi's face.</p><P>"Anyone who hurts one
of my Nakama should just die," Nanashi said as he jumped backwards
landing behind Naruto. "Die," Nanashi said as he brought his
spear down on Naruto.</p><P>"<U>Dimension Arm:
Hirashin</U>," Naruto said disappearing and appearing behind
Nanashi. "Look I didn't kill or seriously harm any of your Nakama
so can you just drop it right now?" Naruto asked as Nanashi turned
around. "Besides you were the one who started the fight," Naruto
said as Nanashi calmed down.</p><P>"I guess I should
judge a person's strength before attacking," Nanash said as he
withdrew his spear into a ring again.</p><P>"Just don't attack
me like that again…" Naruto said as he relaxed from his fighting
form. "I'll be able to heal your men a bit but I'm not at a
master's level at healing so don't expect complete healing,"
Naruto said as he went over to the two men he hit with Kaze no yaiba.</p><P>"You have a healing
arm also?" Nanashi asked as he went over to Naruto.</p><P>"Well… no but I
still can do this," Naruto said as his hand glowed a bright green
color, visibly healing the wounds on the men.</p><P>"How?" Nanashi
asked as he looked at what Naruto did with his mouth dropping low,
almost touching the ground.</p><P>"Healing ninjutsu…
a trade secrete," Naruto said peaking Nanashi's curiosity even
more.</p><P>"Can anyone learn
it?" Nanashi asked a bit of hope in his eyes.</p><P>"Maybe," Naruto
said as he put on a foxy smile.</p><P>"Gah just tell me…
if I learned a technique like that or how you walked on the walls it
would help protect my guild more," Nanashi said as Naruto stood up
finished. "Hey how about I invite you to my place… I'll get
you something to drink over there,"</p><P>"I won't teach you
my techniques but I accept your offer," Naruto said as he suddenly
jumped up in the air.</p><P>"Not fast enough
Naruto," Naruto heard Rush say before he was punched straight into
the ground.</p><P>"Gah…" Naruto
said before he blacked out.</p><P>"Who are you?"
Nanashi asked as he put himself in a defensive stance.</p><P>"Huh me? I'm this
guy's Guardian. Now the question is who are you?" Rush asked as
he picked up Naruto and put him on his shoulder.</p><P>"Nanashi leader of
the Luberia guild… I just recently invited him over to my guild for
a drink," Nanashi said as he stared at Rush.</p><P>"I guess he could
relax a bit. Show me the way Nanashi," Rush said as the other
cronies started to wake up.</p><P>"Ok mister…"
Nanashi said.</p><P>"Rush," Rush said,
"now pick up the pace," Rush said.</p><P>"I can see why your
names Rush," Nanashi said silently as he started to walk back to
his guild.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"I see the guild of
Luberia still attacks wanderers for their arms," Rush said as he
sat at a table with Nanashi.</p><P>"Hey we're thieves
so we have to live up to our reputation," Nanashi said as he took a
swing from a cup of what seemed to be an alcoholic drink.</p><P>"As a leader
shouldn't you stay away from alcohol?" Rush asked as he just
looked at the drink in front of him.</p><P>"Bah can't a guy
relax?" Nanashi slurred his question as he the alcohol started to
get to him.</p><P>"Why do people even
like drinks like this?" Naruto asked as he sniffed the drink in
front of him also.</p><P>"It loosens you up
and it makes you feel good," Nanashi slurred as his face had a red
blush on it.</p><P>"Ah captain I think
you should stop drinking," one of the men said as he looked at
Nanashi start to loose his hand eye coordination.</p><P>"Aw what are you
talking about me and these guys are having a great time see?"
Nanashi said as he stood up and started to walk in a drunken stupor
towards Naruto.</p><P>"Wow…" Naruto
just said as he saw Nanashi walk closer to him.</p><P>"Here drink up
Naruto," Nanashi said as he grabbed Naruto and his drink.</p><P>"No it's ok,"
Naruto said as he struggled to get out of Nanashi's grasp.</p><P>"No I insist,"
Nanashi said a he pushed the cup of beer into Naruto's face.</p><P>"What are you doing?"
Naruto asked as he suddenly felt really dizzy, "Oh look pretty
stars," Naruto said as he weakly grabbed onto Nanashi's shoulder.</p><P>"See I told yah it
makes you feel good," Nanashi said as the two walked around the
area.</p><P>"Underage drinking…
how… I don't even know what to say of it," Rush said as he
stared at the two who were causing a ruckus.</p><P>"A person who matches
the captain's drunken stupor… how scary," another man said as
he saw the two start brawling each other. "Make them stop," the
guy said as he suddenly realized that half the place started to get
destroyed because of the two.</p><P>"Bah so much people
yelling hurts my head," Naruto said as he punched the nearest
person who came to him.</p><P>"I agree… I wonder
where the two get their energy from?" another man said as he ducked
from a man thrown his way.</p><P>"Anyway I hope you
two can stop them because I'm going to catch some ZZZ's," Rush
said as he leaned back on his chair and pulled his bamboo hat over
his eyes.</p><P>"Ahhh that was my
leg," another man screamed as Naruto bit into his leg.</p><P>"They've gone crazy
bring them down quick!!!" another man screamed as everyone threw
themselves onto Naruto and Nanashi.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Aww what a
headache," Naruto said as he woke up in a messed up area. Chairs
and tables were broken while human bodies laid scattered around
everywhere.</p><P>"What happened?"
Nanashi asked as he too woke up.</p><P>"I don't know…
after you forced some of that stuff down my neck I blacked out,"
Naruto said as he rubbed his head some more. "It feels as if
someone threw themselves on me," Naruto said as he looked around
some more.</p><P>"Hmm… De ja vu?"
Nanashi asked as he looked at his members sleeping with worried looks
on their faces.</p><P>"That was a great
nap," Rush said as he woke up to see the two trouble makers awake
with most of the guild in shambles.</p><P>"So Rush what should
we do now?" Naruto asked as he slowly stood up holding his head.</p><P>"First get Kyuubi to
heal that headache of yours… then we'll continue exploring Mar
heaven for now," Rush said as he stood up.</p><P>"Hey before you go
I'll give you something for troubling you," Nanashi said as he
went to a room. "Here you go," Nanashi said as he brought back a
necklace which seemed to be like water. Constantly moving with little
air bubbles in it.</p><P>"What kind of Arm is
that?" Naruto asked as he touched it.</p><P>"A special one which
I can't seem to use… besides I'm not water user I'm a
lightning user," Nanashi said as he gave Naruto the necklace. "It's
a Nature Arm called Water Ring. Using it you should be able to create
water circles which can either restrict movement or be used to
attack," Nanashi explained.</p><P>"Cool," Naruto said
as he put the cool metal around his neck.</p><P>"Another Arm for your
arsenal… a nature one at that," Rush said as he observed the Arm.</p><P>"I hope I see you
again Naruto," Nanashi said as he put his hand out.</p><P>"Sure thing Nanashi,"
Naruto said as he shook his hand. "See ya," Naruto said as
Hirashin glowed before Naruto disappeared.</p><P>"That's sure one
amazing Arm," Nanashi said as he turned back to the guild. "Now
what to do about this mess," Nanashi said as he looked at the mess
in front of him.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So where are we
now?" Naruto asked as he stood upside down on a tree branch.</p><P>"Hmm… some kind of
forest I think," Rush said as he looked around.</p><P>"I know that…"
Naruto said as he jumped off from the branch and landed on the
ground. "But where is this forest?" Naruto asked out loud.</p><P>"It's in the middle
continent next to a town called Ridge(1)," a girls voice said from
somewhere in the woods.</p><P>"Who said that?"
Naruto asked as he looked around.</p><P>"Don't know and
don't care… I'm out of energy," Rush said as he turned into
his arm form.</p><P>"Don't leave me
alone with this creepy voice," Naruto said as he picked up the
chain.</p><P>"Creepy… I take
offense to that," the girl's voice said again a bit irritated.</p><P>"Creepy!!!" Naruto
shouted as he ran away from where he thought the voice was coming
from.</p><P>"Idiot," the voice
shouted as Naruto felt something hit his face forcing him to the
ground.</p><P>"Ow," Naruto said
as he rubbed his face and looked around for the suspect who kicked
him.</p><P>"That's what you
get for calling me creepy," a girl with green hair said in front of
him.</p><P>"Who are you?"
Naruto asked.</p><P>"Me I'm Mina now
who are you and what are you doing in my forest?" the girl asked as
she let Naruto stand up.</p><P>"I'm Naruto,"
Naruto said as he got a better look at her. She seemed to be his
height and his age. She had on a green t-shirt and green jeans which
matched with her green hair. "And what do you mean by your forest?"
Naruto asked as he stood up rubbing his face.</p><P>"As in I created this
forest with my magic power and it's mine to protect," the girl
said as she glared daggers at Naruto.</p><P>"Sorry… I just used
one of my arms to travel a distance and ended up here… this world
keeps on giving me new surprises," Naruto said the last part under
his breath as he assessed the situation in his mind.</p><P>"So what are you
doing in my forest and how did you even get in?" Mina asked again.</p><P>"I told you I used my
arm to travel but ended up in here… as for what I'm doing in this
forest you could say I'm looking for the exit," Naruto said as he
looked around some more.</p><P>"If that's so I'll
lead you out of here," the girl said as she led Naruto some place.</p><P>"Just wondering why
are you here alone?" Naruto asked as the two traveled.</p><P>"… I just have
something in me," Mina said as she continued walking.</p><P>"Something inside of
you? What do you mean?" Naruto asked as he felt he could relate to
her.</p><P>"…" Mina remained
silent as she continued walking.</p><P>"It's just that I
feel that we can relate after all I have something inside of me
also," Naruto said making the girl stop in her steps.</p><P>"Wh-What do you
mean?" Mina asked as she turned to face Naruto.</p><P>"I'm not sure I
want to tell you if you won't tell me," Naruto said as he
pressured her a bit.</p><P>"… fine I'll tell
you. You see I'm not from this world… the world I was from
previously had beasts roaming it with people who attacked not with
Arms but with another force called Chakra," Mina said making Naruto
just stare at her.</p><P>"Where does people
who could use that force mainly called Ninja?" Naruto asked making
Mina stare at Naruto this time.</p><P>"Yes… how do you
know?" the girl asked.</p><P>"Just continue your
story and then I'll tell you at the end," Naruto said causing
Mina to continue.</p><P>"I lived in a village
called Konoha with the first Hokage being my fater," Mina said
causing Naruto to just stare at her some more. "It was when I was 6
years old when a demon attacked me. I tried to defend myself but the
demon was too strong and I ended up serverly injured. Although I did
damage the demon enough it entered my body to recover but for some
reason stayed trapped. The demon didn't like that and used most of
it's power which escaped from me. The result was a tear in what
seems to be space and time sending me here. When the people saw me
they tried to help me but the demon's power somehow influenced me
and caused me to kill some of the people. Ever since then some how
word spread of me and I've been exploring until I found an arm
which worked perfectly with my bloodline. The result is this forest
in which you are in," Mina explained in a long story which
surprisingly Naruto understood a bit.</p><P>"What kind of demon
is it?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"It's a kitsune
demon that's what she said," Mina said shocking Naruto some more.</p><P>"Kitsune… can you
talk to her?" Naruto asked getting a nod from Mina. "Can you ask
her if she knows about Kyuubi?" Naruto asked only to see a black
aura come from Mina.</p><P>"Ahh run away she's
about to come out," Mina said quickly holding her head.</p><P>"Who's coming out?"
Naruto asked only to receive more screaming before a tall women with
black hair stood in front of Naruto. The surprising thing was that
the women had fox ears and 9 fox tails waving behind her.</p><P>"How do you know of
Kyuubi?" the women asked as one of her tails held Naruto down.<p></p><P>"Please don't hurt
him Luna," Mina said weakly as she struggled to stay standing.</p><P>"Shut up I need to
get some information out of him," Luna said as she brought him
closer. "So how do you know of Kyuubi?" the women asked again
her, tails squeezing Naruto.</p><P>"As to how I know her
she's inside of me so stop hurting me," Naruto said only it
caused the women to squeeze him tighter.</p><P>"You're telling me
my little sister is inside of you? Then I guess I can do this," the
girl said as she sent some of her energy into Naruto causing some
more pain for Naruto.</p><P>"Onee-chan?" Naruto
heard Kyuubi say as she appeared out side of Naruto in her human
form.</p><P>"Kyuubi? How did you
get sealed into this kid?" Luna asked as she picked up Naruto even
higher.</p><P>"Ah Nee-chan don't
hurt him," Kyuubi said as she defended Naruto.</p><P>"Why if I kill him
now you should be able to get free… unlike me whos stuck with this
girl," Luna said as she squeezed Naruto even tighter.</p><P>"Just stop it… I
decided for this male to be my Mate so stop it!!!" Kyuubi yelled as
she had a furious blush on her face while her red aura seemed to
match her sisters.</p><P>"Oh you seemed to
have gotten stronger little sister," Luna said a she put Naruto
behind her and flared up her aura some more.</p><P>"You've been gone
for over 50 years(2) so what do you expect," Kyuubi asked getting a
confused look from her sister.</p><P>"50 years that can't
be," Luna said as she stared at Kyuubi.</p><P>"It's true and I've
taken up the title as the new nine tailed fox," Kyuubi said as she
fanned out her tails behind her.</p><P>"I see you've
gotten stronger and are serious… what do you see in a man like
this?" Luna asked as she pulled Naruto closer to her face.</p><P>"Get away from my
man!" Kyuubi yelled as she hit Luna with one of her tails knocking
Naruto out of her grasp.</p><P>"You dare hit your
own sister? I guess I'll have to show you who the true 9 tails is,"
Luna said a she fanned out her tails and prepared to strike.</p><P>"Take this," Kyuubi
yelled as she threw out a blast of chakra at Luna while Luna did the
same.</p><P>"Stop," Naruto said
as he saw the two blasts connect.</p><P>"I'll win for my
mate!" Kyuubi yelled causing the blast to get stronger.</p><P>"Gah," Luna let out
as she saw the blast come at her.</p><P>"Stop fighting,"
Naruto said as he ran in front of the blast taking it full.</p><P>"NARUTO!!!" Kyuubi
yelled as she ran towards where Naruto was hit.</p><P>'That human protected
me, why would he even if I hurt him?' Luna thought as she saw
Kyuubi fretting over Naruto's limp form.</p><P>"Naruto? Naruto are
you alright?" Kyuubi said a she shook Naruto carefully.</p><P>"Why am I your mate
all of a sudden?" Naruto asked weakly before he passed out.</p><P>"You're alright
that's good," Kyuubi said as she hugged Naruto.</p><P>"Neh Kyuubi why do
you care for this man so much?" Luna asked as she looked at Naruto
wryly.</p><P>"He doesn't hate me
to a degree and he's just so cute… besides being with this kid
for 4 can really attach you to him," Kyuubi said as she gently
picked Naruto up. "Is there any place to rest?" Kyuubi asked as
she looked at her sister and her container.</p><P>"There should be…
Mina can you do it?" Luna asked as she looked at Mina.</p><P>"Sure…" Mina said
as she lifted her hands and the trees seemed to move until a giant
house was in front of them.</p><P>"Let him rest here he
should get better," Mina said as she tried to take Naruto from
Kyuubi only to be refused.</p><P>"I'll stay with
him," Kyuubi said as she gently laid him down in the house.</p><P>"You know Kyuubi I
guess I should say I'm proud of you for becoming this strong,"
Luna said as she appeared next to Kyuubi.</p><P>"Thanks… nee-chan…
but when you were gone I had to get stronger on my own so nobody else
would overtake our family place in the demon world. I'm just glad
to know that you're alive," Kyuubi said as she looked at her
sister from her place.</p><P>"But you know if
you're not careful I might steal your man from you…" Luna said
shocking Kyuubi some more. "Just to tell you Mina also feels
attracted to him because their situations are so similar… so
consider your self not the only one running for Naruto's heart.</p><P>"How unfair! Naruto's
mine and mine alone!!!" Kyuubi shouted only to see Luna next to
Naruto.</p><P>"He sure is cute,"
Luna said as she wrapped a tail around him.</p><P>"Ahh get away from
him," Kyuubi said as she tried to push Luna away only to find her
escaping with Naruto.</p><P>"I won't let you
escape," Kyuubi said as she chased after her sister and Naruto's
limp form dangling from Luna's tails.</p><P>"Steal," Mina said
as the wood below Luna sank down and she took Naruto into the
floorboards disappearing.</p><P>"Ahhh why is everyone
after my man?" Kyuubi asked as she searched around.</p><P>In another part of the
house.</p><P>"Hehehehe Naruto is
mine and mine alone," Mina shouted as she watched Naruto sleep.</p><P>Next day.</p><P>"Why is my body so
sore?" Naruto asked as he woke up only to find 3 women sleeping
around him. "I have a feeling my life is going to be stranger,"
Naruto said as he saw the 3 girls start to wake up.</p><P>A/n: I thought I would
make this story a bit more interesting by adding the elements at the
end of the story. Also as you saw Naruto received his fist Nature arm
from Nanashi which they will meet again in the war games. As for
everyone else I might have them meet at a later time. Right now I'm
planning on making this a harem but will it be bad to have the
Kyuubi's sister in it? It might seem weird. As well as the 1st
Hokage's daughter. Well right now I'm wondering if I should have
time skip to the war games period or more exploring… well tell me
what you guys think. As for the time I'm just putting it so I'm
like the god of time and I don't need to be specific.</p><P>1: the story doesn't
say a lot of names so I have to come up with some so don't be angry
at my uncreative names.</p><P>2: I'm changing how
time changes… twice.</p><P>Well READ AND
REVIEW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

Kyuubi,"</B></p><P>"­<U>Techniques/
Activate Arm,"</U></p><P>'Thinking,'</p><P>Disclaimer: I don own
Naruto or Mar (put the two dots over the a) Heaven</p><P>"Where are we now?"
Naruto asked as he looked around in the open area.</p><P>"Like I said before
this forest is next to a town called Ridge… although most towns
fear me this town is quite comfortable around me… thus they haven't
moved anywhere," Mina said as she led Naruto and the others to the
town.</p><P>"True… even when I
come out most of the people there just stare at me not with fear…
some even stare at me with lust," Luna said as she expressed her
discomfort.</p><P>"How come they are
not afraid of you?" Naruto asked as they neared the small town.
"Most of the people in Konoha just stared at me and literally
kicked me out of stores," Naruto said getting some killer intent
from Mina and Luna.</p><P>"That's not even
the tip of it. Every week a mob of villagers would come out and try
to kill him. All because of what I did," Kyuubi said a bit
saddened.</p><P>"That even was worse
then what I went under," Mina said as her hands started to shake.</p><P>"If I was in him I
would've just killed every single one of those bastards," Luna
said as a bit of black aura escaped from her. "Besides what did you
do to get sealed inside of Naruto and get hated so much?" Luna
asked.</p><P>"Once I was a 9
tailed demon I decided to go out and search for you… although while
searching for you I found your scent at Konoha. Excited I turned into
my full demon form which surprised the people in his town. I tried to
get away but ninja's kept on coming so I had no choice to defend
myself. Although once I did more came and soon I found myself facing
a giant frog. Before I knew it I was inside Naruto and have been for
over 16 years… although right now he is 12," Kyuubi said
seemingly getting tears from Luna and Mina.</p><P>"So sad," Luan and
Mina both said as they both took out handkerchiefs to wipe their
tears.</p><P>"We're here,"
Naruto said as they arrived at the first house on the outskirts of
town.</p><P>"Ahh it's Luna-chan
and Mina-chan!" somebody said before more and more people started
to arrive.</p><P>"…didn't you say
most people feared you two?" Naruto asked as the group was suddenly
surrounded.</p><P>"That's why I said
this town is comfortable with us… apparently it was because of what
we did," Luna said as she suddenly felt a bit too invaded. "Let's
just get some supplies and get going," Luna said as she jumped up
into the air followed soon by the others.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Does that always
happen?" Naruto asked as they entered the bazaar.</p><P>"Well… it was at
least 1 year after I came from Konoha when Chess was acting up. By
then I had made quite a name for myself thanks to Luna over here,"
Mina said as Luna scratched her head. "Anyway by that time the war
games were about to start and Chess tried to recruit me. When they
did I was at this village which was already being terrorized by
Chess. Obviously I rejected their offer to join chess and I beat
every single one of the men who threatened this village. After that I
created the forest that surrounded this town a bit protecting this
town. Because of that though this village now sees me a hero and this
happens," Mina said as a male appeared and tried to give her a
flower.</p><P>"We already told you
we're not interested," Luna said as she pulled Mina away from the
guy.</p><P>"Really popular,"
Naruto said as he sensed most of the guys and some girls giving him
glares.</p><P>"Ano… just
wondering but what are you doing with Luna nee-chan and Mina
nee-chan?" a little girl asked as she stopped Naruto.</p><P>"Well… I came here
by accident and they're leading me and Kyuubi here out," Naruto
said only to be stopped by Luna.</p><P>"We decided to follow
this guy right here so we'll be leaving this area for a while…
how long we don't know," Luna said receiving shocked looks from
everyone.</p><P>"Ehhh you can't
leave!!!" one the guys shouted s as they surrounded the group.</p><P>"Yeah you're are
hero's a girl said this time.</p><P>"If you leave who'll
protect us?" another girl said.</p><P>"I know you're
leaving because of those two aren't you?" a guy said as he looked
at Naruto.</p><P>"Why would you leave
with a puny punk like him?" another guy asked as he stared at
Naruto.</p><P>"Just pretend you
didn't here that," Naruto kept on whispering to himself as the
insults kept on coming.</p><P>"How about this if I
beat him then you stay," a guy said as he put his hand to his
necklace. "<U>Weapon Arm: Disc Blades,"</U> the guy shouted
causing the necklace to shine and be replaced by huge metal rings
which were around his arms.</p><P>"Right we should help
to, <U>Weapon Arm: Elbow blades,"</U> another guy shouted causing
long curved blades to extend from his elbows.</p><P>"Don't fight here
take it to the town ring," a girl said showing the way there.</p><P>"Should I?" Naruto
asked as he looked at the 3 girls.</p><P>"Just be sure not to
harm them so much… if Kyuubi's right then you should actually go
easy on them," Luna said.</p><P>"True… he did stand
up to something stronger then you," Luna said as she walked to the
ring.</p><P>"…I guess I don't
have a choice," Naruto said as he followed everyone.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Let's start,"
the guy with the disc blades said as he jumped up into the air and
threw them at Naruto. The two rings came at Naruto at blinding speeds
for most of the people around. "Got you," the guy said as the two
rings were an inch away from Naruto.</p><P>"Really… I thought
it would take forever for those rings to reach me," Naruto said as
he disappeared from sight from the crowd.</p><P>"Nani where did he
go?" the guy with the rings asked only to feel something hit him
hard in the stomach.</p><P>"You're open,"
Naruto said as he pulled back his fist, jumping back to avoid a hit
from the guy with the elbow blades.</p><P>"Shit he's too
fast," the guy said as he helped the disc guy back up.</p><P>"Come on now, I'm
not even warmed up," Naruto said in a taunting voice.</p><P>"I'll show you,"
the guy with the elbow blades said as he charged Naruto before
disappearing as well.</p><P>"Hmm pretty fast,"
Naruto said as he looked around trying to find the guy.</p><P>"I got you," the
guy said as he appeared behind Naruto and took a slash with his
blades. "I actually hit him," the guy said as he saw Naruto
slowly fall down. He was soon disappointed when he saw Naruto turn
into a log.</p><P>"Kawarami," Naruto
said while standing on his head.</p><P>"When did you?" the
guy began to ask.</p><P>"You shouldn't ask
question's like that when you're in such a dangerous position,"
Naruto said as he tightened his legs around his neck. "I should end
this now," Naruto shouted as he leaned backwards taking the making
the guy go backwards with him. Just as he was to land on his back
Naruto put out his hand and did a handstand throwing the guy up with
his momentum. "<U>Nature Arm: Water Ring</U>," Naruto shouted
causing a blue ring to form Naruto's hand.</p><P>"What's he planning
to do in that kind of position?" the guy with the ring arm asked as
he saw his teammate thrown up into the air.</p><P>"My 2nd
Arm, <U>Hirashin</U>," Naruto said as he disappeared and appeared
above the thrown man. "Ensnare," Naruto shouted causing the water
ring around him hand to shoot forward and trap the man. "That's
the only skill I know with this new arm for now," Naruto said as he
landed on his feet while the other landed on his back.</p><P>"Nice combo,"
Kyuubi shouted from the sidelines.</p><P>"That's his first
time with that arm right?" Luna asked as she looked surprised a
bit.</p><P>"Yup he got it
yesterday," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Amazing… even I
couldn't adapt to my Arms that fast," Mina said as she looked
amazed at the scene in front of her,</p><P>Back to the fight</p><P>"Hmph… I guess I'll
have to get serious… Duplicate," the ring man shouted as the 2
rings started to multiply like crazy.</p><P>"This is getting
interesting," Naruto said as he looked around at the floating
rings.</p><P>"Converge," the guy
shouted causing all the rings to surround Naruto before zoom towards
him.</p><P>"Fast," Naruto said
as he started to dodge the rings that tried to hit him. This lasted
for 10 minutes with Naruto still dodging not even breaking a sweat.</p><P>'What's with this
guy? If I keep this up my concentration will dull,' the ring man
thought as he continued the barrage of the rings.</p><P>"This is getting
old," Naruto said as he suddenly stopped moving as the rings still
continued moving.</p><P>"Baka," the ring
man said as the rings all headed towards Naruto.</p><P>"<U>Kamaitachi no
Jutsu</U>,"(I know this needs a fan lets just say Naruto can use it
regularly… after all he trained for 4 years + with Kyuubi in
ninjutsu) Naruto shouted causing the wind around him to blast the
rings back.</p><P>"What kind of Arm was
that?" the man asked as he looked at Naruto shocked.</p><P>"It wasn't an Arm,
it was ninjutsu," Naruto said as he formed a cross seal, "<U>Kage
Bunshin no Jutsu</U>," Naruto shouted creating 4 more of him.</p><P>"Nani!?!?! This has
got to be a trick!" the man shouted while the people watching the
fight could only gawk.</p><P>"Now you're going
down," all five Naruto's said at the same time. "Let's go,"
all five said before they disappeared from plain sight.</p><P>"This is a trick,"
the guy with the ring arm kept on saying as he looked around for
Naruto.</p><P>"The end," Naruto
said as he kicked him up. "<U>U-ZU-MA-KI NARUTO RENDAN</U>,"
Naruto shouted as he hit the man up and then delivered a strong kick
sending the man down. "My win," Naruto said as the 4 clones
around him disappeared while the man landed, knocked out.</p><P>"That boy is strong,"
some people murmured as they went in to help the two men who were
down.</p><P>"Amazing… now I
know why the two hero's are following him," another person said
as they saw Naruto go and meet with the others.</p><P>"We should get going…
I have a feeling we're not alone… and I don't mean the people
around us," Naruto said as he got a nod from Kyuubi.</p><P>"I agree… whoever
it is, is pretty strong," Kyuubi said as she held onto Naruto's
arm.</p><P>"So are you two
really coming with us?" Naruto asked only to receive additional
weight on his other arm.</p><P>"Of course we are…
after all living in the same place is so dull," Luna said as she
held onto Naruto's arm.</p><P>"Ah Onee-chan he's
mine," Kyuubi said as she tried to pull Naruto away.</p><P>"Let's just get out
of this area… I'll lead us out of here since we could get lost,"
Mina said as she formed a seal with her hands. "This way," Mina
said as they walked past the crowd.</p><P>"Wait," Naruto
heard one of the two guys he sparred say.</p><P>"What?" Naruto
asked as he looked at the two ragged fighters.</p><P>"We have never been
beaten before by anyone so this is just something for you to use to
protect our two hero's some more," the ring man said as he threw
2 gloves at Naruto. "It's weapon Arm call <U>White Flash</U> it
should match your Hirashin well," the man said as Naruto put the
gloves on.</p><P>"Why give me
something so powerful?" Naruto asked in a puzzled tone.</p><P>"Truth is that no one
seems to be able to handle the speed because of the magic power and
speed. The last person that used this was someone who looked like you
a bit. We don't know where he is now but he just suddenly appeared
in this town right before the war games," the man said causing
Naruto to stop and put on a serious face. "Well anyway the effects
should be like hitting from far away and forming some kind of blade
from the gloves. Although for some reason nobody could emulate the
effects," the man said causing Naruto to think some more.</p><P>"I see…" Naruto
said as he looked at the gloves some more. 'another memento from my
father,' Naruto thought.</p><P>"Let's go,"
Kyuubi said as she grabbed Naruto's arm and lead him towards Mina
and Luna.</p><P>"Finally time to
explore again," Mina said as they entered the forest and
disappeared from sight.</p><P>From the skies.</p><P>"So that kid has at
least 3 rare arms with him… maybe I should pay them a visit?" a
girl on a broom said as she went towards the way they went.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"We're being
followed by the same person as before," Naruto said as they exited
the forest.</p><P>"True… and she's
pretty strong," Kyuubi said as she suddenly got down in a defensive
position.</p><P>"She comes," Luna
said as her tails flared behind her.</p><P>"Who does she think
she is?" Mina said as she plants started to grow where she stood.</p><P>"I see there's no
point in hiding my presence," a girl said as she appeared in front
of them, falling from the sky. "Allow me to introduce myself, I'm
Dorthy a witch… if you want to live hand over your arms," Dorthy
said as she held out her hand.</p><P>"No," all 4 said
simply causing Dorthy to fall down.</p><P>"Just hand over your
Arm's and no one gets hurt," Dorthy said as she lifted her hands
up.</p><P>"I'll take care of
this," Mina said as she stepped forward.</p><P>"Resisting still…
then take this," Dorthy said as she jumped back and activated an
Arm. "Toto come out," Dorthy said as a rip appeared in the space
above her before a huge wolf came out.</p><P>"What can I do for
you master?" the wolf asked as it stared at the people in front of
it's master.</p><P>"I want you to go and
eat the girl over there," Dorthy said simply as she pointed as
Mina.</p><P>"Hai," the wolf
said as it bounded forward to Mina.</p><P>"<U>Weapon Arm: Wood
Hammer</U>," Mina shouted as a giant wooden hammer appeared in her
hands. "Take this!" Mina shouted as she brought the wooden hammer
down missing Toto by inches.</p><P>"What kind of
monstrous strength do you have?" Dorthy asked as she saw the crater
made by strength of the girl.</p><P>"She sure is scary,"
Naruto said as he just stared at the crater.</p><P>"This is nothing,"
Luna said as she looked at the sight in front of her, "If that
Dorthy girl doesn't do something quick then she's toast,"</p><P>"What did you teach
her?" Kyuubi asked as she saw the sight.</p><P>"You'll see,"
Luna said as Toto charged at Mina again.</p><P>"Toto stop playing
around and eat her," Dorthy said as she started to get agitated.</p><P>"Hai," Toto said as
he picked up speed.</p><P>"I see you're
picking up speed… not good enough, <U>Nature Arm: Wood Tower</U>,"
Mina said causing towers of trees to rise near Toto.</p><P>"Uh oh," Toto said
as he was hit by a tower causing him to fly up into the air.</p><P>"Toto return… I
guess I should attack," Dorthy said as she picked up Toto's arm
form and charged at Mina.</p><P>"Not a good idea
especially with all this wood beside you," Mina said as she started
to form some hand seals.</p><P>"I don't see what
good that would do," Dorthy said as she picked up her broom causing
air to surround her.</p><P>"(Don't know
Japanese much) <U>Wood ensnare jutsu</U>," Mina shouted as she
finished her seals. From the trees that were around Dorthy had roots
come out and restrict Dorthy's movements.</p><P>"How did that
happen?" Dorthy asked as she let go of her broom causing the winds
around her to die down.</p><P>"And that's
checkmate," Mina said as she walked back to the group.</p><P>"Not done yet,"
Dorthy said as she struggled to move her fingers. "<U>Weapon Arm:
Ring Dagger</U>," Dorthy shouted causing one of her rings to turn
into a dagger. Grabbing the tip of the dagger she threw it upwards
cutting some of the roots trapping her arms. "Zephyrus," Dorthy
shouted as she grabbed hold of the broom. "Payback," Dorthy
shouted as she cut the roots and trees around her with the wind
created from the broom.</p><P>"I'll take care of
this," Naruto calmly said as he stepped forward. "<U>Kanashibari
no Jutsu,</U>" Naruto shouted causing Dorthy to freeze momentarily.
"<U>Kaze no Yaiba</U>," Naruto shouted as he disappeared from
sight and appeared behind Dorthy.</p><P>"What did you do?"
Dorthy asked before cut started to appear over her body.</p><P>"You should know,
after all you control wind also," Naruto said as Dorthy passed out.
"Now what should we do with her?" Naruto asked as he saw her form
lying limp in front of him.</p><P>"Sadly if we just
left her here she would probably be taken advantage from some
pervert… although she did attack us," Kyuubi said as she stood
next to Naruto.</p><P>"Well I'm against
perverts so let's just help her until she can go on her own again,"
Luna said getting some agreement from Mina.</p><P>"Agreed… let's
set up camp here, I don't think I can stay awake for today,"
Naruto said as he drowsily looked at in front of him.</p><P>"Fine," Mina said
as she formed a seal with her hands causing the mansion from the
forest to appear in front of them.</p><P>"I guess I used too
much energy today," Naruto said as he started to fall backwards
only to be caught by Kyuubi.</p><P>"Well he did enough
today," Kyuubi said as she pulled him inside the house.</p><P>"Ah don't hog him
by yourself," Luna said as she chased after her sister and Naruto.</p><P>"sigh I guess I
have to take this girl in," Mina said as she dragged Dorthy into
the house then chased after the other two girls to find Naruto.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Where am I?"
Dorthy asked as she looked around to find herself in some kind of
house.</p><P>"I see you're
awake," Dorthy heard a voice say before turning to it. There she
saw the same blond from yesterday who had defeated her.</p><P>"Where am I and why
am I here?" Dorthy asked as she reached for her broom only not to
find it anywhere near her.</p><P>"Well you were
injured from yesterdays fight so we thought we would help you
recover, being the civil people we are," Naruto said as he moved
over to her side. "A few more minutes and you should be all
healed," Naruto said as his hands glowed a green color visibly
healing the wounds from the battle.</p><P>"How did you do that?
I saw no healing arm or anything," Dorthy said in amazement.</p><P>"Déjà
vu…" Naruto said as he finished. "That's something you should
ask Nanashi if you ever meet him," Naruto said as he pulled back
his hand and walked to the door. "Your Arm's are by the cabinet
next to you so you're welcome to leave anytime," Naruto said as
he walked out.</p><P>"Thanks for the
treatment I guess… just wondering how did you do those other
techniques without any Arms?" Dorthy asked as her curiosity
returned.</p><P>"That's a secrete,"
Naruto said as he left the room only to run screaming followed by
three girls screaming for him to stop.</p><P>"What an interesting
group," Dorthy said as she picked up her Arms and left the
building.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Well what now?"
Naruto asked as he exited the house while Mina made the house go down
into the ground.</p><P>"Well… why don't
we go look for some more Arms… there ought to be some in special
areas or something," Mina said as she looked around.</p><P>"True… that's how
you found your wood hammer," Luna said as she stretched a bit.</p><P>"Which way should we
go?" Kyuubi asked as her ears went up.</p><P>"Wanna just jump
again with Hirashin?" Naruto asked as he held up his arm.</p><P>"Sure why not,"
Kyuubi said as she held onto Naruto causing the other two to hold
onto him as well.</p><P>"<U>Dimension Arm:
Hirashin</U>," Naruto shouted causing all four to disappear.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Where are we now?"
Naruto asked as he asked from the side of what seemed to be a castle.</p><P>"Don't know but
seems like we're missing 2," Kyuubi said as she looked around.</p><P>"Did I screw up?"
Naruto asked as he looked around for Mina and Luna.</p><P>"Oh well this is
better for me, more time for me to spend with you," Kyuubi said as
she suddenly disappeared.</p><P>'Out of energy?'
Naruto thought to Kyuubi.</p><P>"Well damn… I guess
I do need my sister to keep me out of this blasted seal," Kyuubi
said from behind her bars. "I could do it myself but it would cause
extreme pain for both of us," Kyuubi said as she thought of another
way out.</p><P>"Hey what are you
doing there?" a guy asked Naruto. Naruto looked up to see a another
person above him staring at Naruto from a window. The person looked a
bit like Sasuke only his hair was pointed up just like Naruto's.
Below his eye he had a weird pattern but all in all he seemed ok.</p><P>"I messed up one of
my Arm's and ended up here," Naruto said as he looked down to see
he was higher up then he had expected.</p><P>"Oh really… you're
not with chess I can see that," the kid said as he stared at
Naruto's ear. "But you're not with the cross guard either… so
who are you?" the guy asked.</p><P>"Me? My name is
Naruto and I don't belong to any organizations," Naruto said as
he stared up at the guy. "Now who are you?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"The name's Alviss…
as for who I'm with, I'm with the cross guard," Alviss said as
Naruto recalled something about the cross guard in his dad's
scroll. "Now can you get off that wall so we can question you?"
Alviss said as more people started to appear next to Alviss.</p><P>"Sure if you can
catch me… I want to see your potential first," Naruto said as he
opened his arms and fell backwards.</p><P>"What is that guy
crazy?" a person by the window asked as he saw Naruto slowly come
closer to the ground.</p><P>"No he's planning
something," Alviss said as he saw Naruto go into a ball position
and start rolling backwards before landing on a roof. "Spread out
and catch him," Alviss said as the other cross guard member's
agreed and ran down the castle tower.</p><P>"What do you see
there?" a man asked Alviss.</p><P>"Nothing much Alan
sir only a kid with blond hair running from us," Alviss said.</p><P>"Oh really… blond
hair you say," Alan said as he started to rub his chin. "I guess
I'll go check this out also," Alan said as he took the cigarette
out of his mouth and crushed it on the window. 'Which one could it
be?' Alan thought as he slowly went down the steps.</p><P>Meanwhile with Naruto.</p><P>"You gotta do better
then that," Naruto said as he jumped from roof to roof dodging the
cross guard members who were still chasing him.</p><P>"What's with this
guy? He just keeps on running and jumping not even faltering… when
will he reach his limit?" one member asked as he sat down panting
heavily.</p><P>"Don't give up, he
might help us if we catch him," another member said as he brought a
ring up. "<U>Weapon Arm: Mythril Spear," </U>the man shouted
causing a blue spear to appear next to him. "Take this," the man
said as he threw the spear at Naruto who dodged it easily.</p><P>"Come on if this
keeps up how are you going to defeat Chess which I heard so much
about," Naruto said as he jumped onto another building and ran the
opposite direction.</p><P>"<U>Air hammer</U>,"
Naruto heard causing him to jump backwards to avoid a blast of air
directed to him.</p><P>"Oh ho someone with
skill I see," Naruto said as he stared at the man in front of him.
The man had white clothing mainly and had his hair put in a long
ponytails a bit longer then his shoulder.</p><P>"Who are you little
boy?" the man asked as he raised his hands ready to strike.</p><P>"Just someone
enjoying this world," Naruto said as he prepared to jump away only
to duck to dodge a hit from a pole.</p><P>"Why should we
believe someone with skills such as yours?" Alviss asked as he
readied his pole to strike.</p><P>"What you think I
belong to chess or something?" Naruto asked getting two serious
stares from the two. "Why would I belong to them? After all my dad
fought them and now I have to avenge his humility," Naruto said
causing Alan to drop his hand and put a fresh new cigarette in his
mouth.</p><P>"Tell me who was your
father?" Alan asked although he already knew the answer.</p><P>"Namikaze Minato,"
Naruto said with a huge grin on his face.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><p align="center">end</p><P>Rush: hey why didn't
I get a part in this chapter at all?</p><P>Me: Sorry… I just
didn't feel you were needed.</p><P>Rush: oh so you're
saying you don't want me in this story at all aren't you.</p><P>Me: no no just stay and
you'll be introduced a lot in the next chapter… you'll be out
the whole time while Kyuubi stays inside.</p><P>Rush: Really?!</p><P>Me: most likely.</p><P>Kyuubi: Hey what about
me then?</p><P>Mina: yeah you sent me
off to some weird place</p><P>Luna: I can't see my
precious Naruto.</p><P>Me: now now you don't
need to go kill me over it</p><P>All of them: Get him</p><P>ME: Noo get back
noooooo.</p><P>Naruto: The author
would just like to say a few A/n's now</p><P>A/n: well sorry folks
for not updating often I just got lazy. As for some other things… I
was thinking about starting another story… Ah stop it I know I
should stick to my stories such as Naruto a craftknight and this one
but I get new ideas each day… besides I don't get much reviews so
if I keep on writing something I'm bound to hit gold someday. As
for some things… I decided to do 1 or 2 more chapters of exploring
before the war games… the pairings will most likely be a harem but
I don't think I can add any Mar characters other then Oc's if I
do make another one tell me what you guys want from 1. a chess piece
Oc 2. A cross piece Oc 3. both of them. 4. none of them. Well now as
I said before the times I've changed them twice so don't go
blabbing and flaming me about them… and I do read my reviews and I
don't want to be killed hehehe.</p><P>Well READ AND
REVIEW!!!!!</p>
