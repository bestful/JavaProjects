Tokyo</p><p><i><b>The fox and her friend</b></i></p><p><b>Chapter 1</b></p><p><i><b>Under normal circumstances most kids would love their birthday, even more today was a great celebration seeing as how it's the day the 4</b></i><i><b>th</b></i><i><b> hokage defeated the kyuubi no kitsune. But it's also the day that the 4</b></i><i><b>th</b></i><i><b> died in doing so .so here's how the story goes, 7 years ago the kyuubi no kitsune attacked the village of kanoha, brave shinobi fought valiantly to hold it back until the 4</b></i><i><b>th</b></i><i><b> hokage came .when he arrived he came with that of a newborn baby, he then sealed the kyuubi no kitsune in the child's stomach, sacrificing himself in doing so, as he lay there his last words barely audible were spoken "take care of my son, he is a hero to the entire village tell him only about me when he is a chunin or upon his eighteenth birthday, along with everyone else give him my things and give him my name on that day, until then this is his name." with that said the 4</b></i><i><b>th</b></i><i><b> hokage the youngest to ever have been, died at the anbu's feet .the anbu then took the child and the paper to an old man. When he found who he was looking for he bowed and spoke 'here is the child'. The anbu said as he handed an envelope to the hokage. Sarutobi then took the envelope pulled out the letter and began to read when he finished he looked at the anbu and said "take the kid to the orphanage and tell them that by order of the hokage they are to take care of the child". With that said the anbu took the child and with one final word 'hai, hokage –sama'. The young anbu turned to take him to the orphanage "oi" the elderly man called to the dog masked anbu "you will be the boy's personnel guard along with asuma". 'Hai'. Answered kakashi, "I will tell them, he paused is this a mission?' the hokage turned to him, "yes, and you two will be paid for a b-rank mission". 'Okay hokage ,I will tell him, see you later' kakashi then shunshined in a swirl of leaves while sarutobi went to the office to get started rebuilding konoha and to put minato's belongings in the blood-seal safe behind minato's picture in his office .</b></i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The day was oct. 10th as Naruto ran down the back streets away from the festival, it was his birthday and this time the drunken mob wanted to 'finish the job of the 4th'. On naruto's Angry shouts arose from the crowd.</p><p>Get back here demon!</p><p>Why do you run from your fate?You will die!</p><p>Why do you chase me? I did do anything! The young blond screamed with tears streaming down his face wishing his anbu guard's weren't on an a mission at the moment but tracking down a missing ninja was a job fit for them. "Stop now demon"! Naruto made a sharp let turn into a alley and tripped on a trash bag, falling face first in the dirt. He sat up and watched as the crowd passed by shouting 'where is he ,he can't hide for long'! as he stood he heard another voice as a man closed in on him shouting "here he is"! he looked in horror as the crowed came back and blocked him in praising the one that found him. They then started to gather their weapons and fist to strike him. The first was from behind as a plank of wood connected to the back of his head</p><p>Time skip 30 min.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto had already passed out due to the pain and lack of blood. He woke in a sewer to find he had a hard time breathing he opened his eye's to see he was face first in a pool of water to the sound of a crying girl. He thought the drunks dumped him in a sewer; he then followed the sound and soon came to a large cage closed by s paper seal.</p><p>Inside the cage he saw a young girl about his age.</p><p>'Hey, you okay?</p><p>Receiving no answer and having never seen her before, he thought he had a chance to make a friend. He then squeezed in between the bars and approached the crying girl.</p><p>He sat down beside her and he heard a muffled 'I'm sorry'.</p><p>What do ya mean you're sorry?" she turned to him and looked him in the eye briefly 'It's my fault your life is this way, if I didn't go out that day, the man with the eye wouldn't have made me attack the village. So I'm sorry Naruto-san'</p><p>After about ten minutes of silence, well as silent you can get with sniffles and the dripping of water out of pipes Naruto not knowing what she means or who she is and why she knows his name but he never met her in his life said "I still did catch your name".</p><p>She said something inaudible. "What did you say, I didn't catch that?"</p><p>"You promise you won't run".</p><p>'Of course, and when I promise I always keep my promises.'</p><p>'okay, my name is kyuubi no kitsune.'</p><p>When he heard this he looked puzzled.</p><p>"Your parents named you after the demon fox?" She shook her head saying no 'I am the demon fox' when he heard this his brain finally took in her appearances he saw nine fox tails with black tip's swaying behind her, and two fox ear's with black tip's in her crimson hair .he immediately flushed with fear. She sensed this, saying with a pleading face 'please don't leave me here, she started crying 'promise I won't hurt you' Naruto was just about to break his first promise when he heard this seeing as how he could not, would not and didn't want to leave a crying girl alone he said "don't worry I won't leave "with that he walked over and hugged her. At that moment three things happened, kyuubi was relieved to have made a friend, Naruto smiled at this to, and as he looked at her tails he noticed that she was naked. He was then looking at here butt (which was quite nice in his mind) she then picked up on a couple of things 1.) He was nervous 2.)He was embarrassed and scared .and 3.)his checks were getting hotter by the second with a faint smell of blood .Naruto then fell to his knees as kyuubi said 'are you o.k., you have a nose bleed and your face is red '(secretly she admired the color). "I'm so sorry it won't happen again I was just looking at your tails and I saw your butt and it won't happen again. Please don't hit me." she looked at him with a puzzled expression "do you like them"? "What!" my tails do you like them? Well they're cool but you aren't gonna hit me? As he said this he started to look up and got a severe nose bleed seeing kyuubi in all her glory, and passed out due to loss of blood.</p><p>When he came to he was laying on the floor with kyuubi looking at him with her hair behind her back giving his eyes full access to her assets. He quickly averted his eyes from her "will you put some clothes on"? She looked at him puzzled at the question 'What is a clothes'? he sighed and looked at her "That's right here "he took his shirt off and gave it to her "hold this" he zipped his jacket half way up fully aware of the blush that sported their faces , taking back the shirt, "lift up your arms" as she did so, he put the shirt on her. As he saw her face they both thought the same thing .she/i doesn't like it. in kyuubis mind This shirt was clingy and restricted her movements. She wanted it off but was afraid that Naruto would get mad and leave her alone so she did her best to hide her annoyance. "so, kyuu-chan, you can you tell me why you attacked konoha?" kyuubi paused she was happy he gave her a pet name but didn't like to talk about that night but decided to tell him so he doesn't hate her 'sure naru-kun but please don't interrupt okay' when she got a nod she began 'well I didn't actually attack you see, I was trapped in a genjutsu called tsukuyomi made by mangekyou sharingan. I'll tell you about that later but i was manipulated by madara uchiha to destroy konoha for a reason unknown to me. But he forced me to attack and kill the people of your village. I was helpless and forced to watch as women and children were killed by my demon form. Then I was attacked by a small army of shinobi, from what I was hearing as I fought against the genjitsu and my captor, I heard them say something about holding me until their hokage the yondaime I believe got there. When he arrived madara fled releasing me from his genjutsu and I started to defend myself against the shinobi while moving back to my domain thinking that they would stop's was so scared when they didn't I thought they were gonna kill me then they all started to push forward forcing me back to the forest until a yellow flash appeared in front of me along with a giant toad. I remembered him from when my father took me with him to see the summons. he was the boss summon of the toads when the shinobi started to stop and back away I stood there holding my ground not wanting to feel weak but I still felt scared then he started doing hand signs and yelled shikki fujiin and summoned the death god the next thing I knew I saw black and fell asleep. The next day I woke up here." She said finishing the tale. After a few minutes of silence Naruto looked at her "so… where we are exactly I mean are we in the seal or in a sewer?" he asked with a puzzled look on his face. 'Well we are in what I call the mindscape, it is a place where the seal and your subconscious meet allowing me to talk to and see you when your unconscious or asleep' .As kyuubi finished telling him where they were, Naruto glanced at the seal and said rather nonchalantly "I think I can take down the seal and let you get out" thinking that since he was the jailer he had a key or something "you would do that"? Kyuubi was confused she was controlled to kill many people and destroy his village but he wanted her out 'well I think if you could learn the <u>shiki fujin technique</u> then you could reverse it , or maybe a seal master could release it, OH! I know if you rip the seal paper on the bars the actual seal should break and let me out ,but I think you would feel great pain with my chakra coming out of the seal' "well that seems simple enough" 'but are you sure I mean what will we saw if they ask who I am' "of course I'm sure you're my friend anyway and well tell them you ran away from the orphanage in a neighboring village and ran hear, then well go from there." he then reached up and started to pull the seal off, then said "besides you were controlled, it wasn't your fault ,oh, and don't hurt anyone". With that he ripped off the seal like a Band-Aid. Blinding white light filled the cage.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>_<i><u>Reality</u></i><i>_</i></p><p>Itachi had already sat Naruto down on a hospital bed remembering the events that followed up to this. <i>He, anko and kurenai had just gotten back from a mission when they heard yelling coming from an alleyway, he ran up to the crowd seeing Naruto about to be stabbed "what are you doing?" he yelled as a kunai was flung hitting the man with the knife in the arm causing him to fling his arm back and scream in pain, the crowd was attempting to run when large snakes surrounded them. 'w-we were ab-bout to k-k-kill the demon.' said a random man in the crowd, stuttering with fear. "what demon, I only see a little kid getting beat!" yelled an enraged anko when a hand went on her shoulder "calm down, I'm gonna take him to the hospital he looked at anko with a smirk, help kurenai 'interrogate them' she smirked and reminded her self to thank itachi for the "fun". "sure itachi she and kurenai turned to them as itachi holding a bloody and beaten Naruto jumped across buildings to the hospital smiled hearing the crowd's screams signifying that the girls were doing their job.</i></p><p>Itachi sighed and went to the bathroom closing the door behindhim<i> ' we just got promoted to his guards and this happens ,think I'll tell the girls he's o.k.' </i> he left when the seal started to glow and kyuubi's chakra pooled out and formed a girl. Kyuubi opened her eye's with one thought <i>'it worked'</i> she got under the blanket and pressed her lips to Naruto's and whispered goodnight . Itachi later returned to sleep in naruto's hospital room not noticing the extra lump on the bed</p><p>The next morning an Anbu went to check on Naruto. personally he didn't care for the brat but had to obey orders. He opened the door surprised at the site, his anbu captain was sleeping in a chair beside his bed "<i>well that's weird, oh well that just means I can go get breakfast".</i> When the anbu left itachi woke up to see a still sleeping Naruto . he glanced at Naruto and took in his appearance that had changed since he first met him, '<i>huh, his hair seems a bit brighter and longer and he seem's to have red hair hanging off the side of the bed'.</i> As itachi crossed the room he noticed the extra lump next to Naruto and noticed a strange yet powerful chakra signature, as he stood at the left side of the bed he bent down an attempted to grab the hair only to notice that it looked like a tail he cautiously stood up and leaned over to shake Naruto awake when a hand shot out of the blanket . '<i>what the?' </i>he immediately went to grab his sword's hilt when he heard a stern feminine voice as a red head sat up "don't you dare touch Naruto-kun you filth you call your self a protector of the village people yet you try to assassinate this boy after he was brought here"? he looked at her with disbelief a blush forming on his face<i> she's sitting next to Naruto</i> ,<i>naked and awake ,yet she didn't know that I was watching over him the entire night,he sweat-droped at the thought</i> he did the only sensible thing that his thirteen year old mind could think of at seeing a naked 12year old girl with a sizeable bust for her age, he fainted with a blush on his face.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Two figures can be seen hopping across buildings towards the apartment building. one of these figures has no shirt, well defined build and whisker marks on his cheeks. The other figure is wearing a black tee shirt that comes down to her mid-thigh, she has long crimson hair with black tips down to her mid back and a few extra "appendages" coming from under the shirt. they stopped at an apartment building and went in through a window "well, here we are my humble abode" kyuubi raised an eye brow in confusion,"whats an abode "? "never mind that ,i'll get you some proper cloths and we can ..go..get...some...food"as he turerned to kyuubi he saw that she was asleep in his bed ..not listening to him.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto then sat on the couch to think about what happened when he awoke<i> naruto was invited back into the world of the counsious seeing kyuubi and itachi playing cards the first getting mad at the later ,who was winning. "uhhhh hey ...how are things itachi" "nothing much ,just playing with your friend, don't worry your secrets safe with me i'll have somebody go to your house when she says she needs something and she explained everything". did she then said Naruto looking at kyuubi well i guess there's nothing to explain , kyuubi we need to go home itachi see you tomorrow". as they said there good byes parted ways Naruto couldn't shake the feeling he was being watched .</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>the next morning Naruto was startled by the sound of banging on the door as he got up he noticed he had some weight on top of him ,looking down he saw kyuubi laying on his chest deciding not to think about it he slipped from her hold and answered the door to the face of itachi and kurenai "hey 'tachi ,kurenai"." hey Naruto " was the response from both</p><p>" i asked kurenai to help you with your <i>friend</i>" Naruto looked at him with a reply some one would give on a Sunday morning at 8:00 " okay, well come back later i'm tired good day" and that was the end of that conversation as he shut the door and laid down to a couple more hours of sleep.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>so how was it . its been sitting on my computer for a bout 2 years now and i forgot about it till a week ago so tell me if anythings wrong and review ! they make me happy and yes this will have more to come.</p>
