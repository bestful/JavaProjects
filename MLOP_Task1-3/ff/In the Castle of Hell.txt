was being pressed against his face. Breathe. Yes, he should breathe
before thinking about anything else. He opened his lips and gulped
down air and sighed in content as his lungs worked automatically.
Something warm was pressed against his forehead as the cold thing was
removed.</P><P>"Get
Kyuubi-Sama and tell him that his kit is waking and seems to be
fine," a light, girly voice called. His blue eyes flashed open on a
whim. Above him was a blue eyed-blue haired… Demon, yes, demon.
"Ah, welcome to the Waking Realm, Kit-Sama."</P><P>"…How
long've I been out?" asked the blond as the woman helped him sit
up.</P><P>"Well, by
Earth standards, you've been <I>dead</I> two years, but here, in
Hell, you've only been unconscious for four weeks." Naruto gave
her an odd look. "Hell time is different from earth time. Two weeks
in Hell is one year on Earth because Hell's days are much longer."
Before Naruto could question any more, the double doors to the room
burst open, revealing… Wait, was that Kyuubi? Geez. Kyuubi wore a
pair of drawstring red sweatpants. That's all.</P><P>Kyuubi smiled,
brushing back a strand of his shoulder length red hair, his
rust-colored eyes shining joyfully. He held his arms out. "My
Naru~!" he chirped. Naruto smiled.</P><P>"Kyuu-Chan,"
he croaked.</P><P>Kyuubi's eyes
narrowed. "Someone get my baby some water!" he squawked. The
woman next to the sexy-god blond nodded and ran to the sink across
the room, filling what resembled a vase with water. She ran back to
Naruto and he nodded, not bothering to thank her. He tipped it back
like alcohol and set the vase-glass down. Kyuubi gave the demon woman
a look and she nodded, running from the room. She closed the doors
behind her and Kyuubi pounced on his blond Adonis. Naruto hugged
Kyuubi to him as the red head kissed his face all over. "Know where
we are, Kit?"</P><P>"No<I>pe</I>.
Enlighten me, Kyuu-Chan," teased the blond. Kyuubi snarled and
playfully bit the blond's ear. Naruto moaned.</P><P>"The <I>throne
room of Hell</I>," purred the demon. "That means that if I take
you here and now… Well, here at any time, we will forever rule over
Hell together and the only way we can change rulers is if someone
were to kill us… <I>At the same time</I>."</P><P>Naruto inhaled
Kyuubi's scent. "Sounds like," he let out a breathy moan as
Kyuubi nipped one of his hardening nipples, "I'll be stuck with
you," Kyuubi's hands tugged at the waist of Naruto's blue
drawstring sweatpants, "for a long fucking time, huh?"</P><P>Kyuubi's
fingers danced on the blond's face and he moved his body downwards,
sliding off Naruto's pants. He played with the edge of Naruto's
boxers, licking the blond's stomach. "Yup," mumbled the demon
and Naruto moaned again.</P><P>Outside the
Castle of Hell, demons were grouped up, waiting. They only dispersed
when they heard the two names.</P><P>"<I>Haaah…
Nngh… AHHHHHHHH! KYUUBI!"</I></P><P>"…<I>Fsh…
Ahhh… Haaanh… Uh- Naruto, you're still too tight…"</I></P><P>"<I>KYUUBI!"</I></P><P>Nodding, the
blue haired demon skipped down the stairs, camera in hand.</P>
