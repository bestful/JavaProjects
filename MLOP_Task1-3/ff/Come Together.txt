Hello! If you've read any of my other work and wondering why I
deleted them it's simply because… none of them had real endings!!
(nervous laughter)</B></p><P><B>Yuki:
WHAT?!? You deleted my story!!? I was the star!!</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Ya well deal! I'm ashamed with myself as it is!!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
Sweet this stories all about me!! And I'm a… keeper of the
forest? What does that even mean?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Well, you are like the people who protect and take care of the
forest!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
I'm a hippie?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Not a hippie! Just a person who loves nature and wants to protect it!
There's a difference you know!! </B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
I'm not a hippie, right?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Not a hippie!! And no! You aren't… how should I put this… FREE
enough. Like you always follow the rules! Ya know!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Phew! That's good to know!</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Well, on with the story!!</B></p><P><B>Disclaimer:
I own nothing except a computer, a key board, and Microsoft Word! So
DON'T SUE ME!!!</B></p><P>It
was a normal day in the forest of Konoha. Animals were frolicking,
nests were being made, angry protestors yelling at a line of
construction workers coming towards the forest with big heavy
machinery. Yep, normal day. At least normal since three days ago when
it was announced that half of the forest would be cut down to make
room for the new mall's parking lot. Of course the Keepers of the
Forest didn't like this one bit. For gosh sake they've lived
their whole lives protecting this forest and by God they weren't
going to give it up this easily!</p><P>"Get
away from this forest you horrible people!" yelled a protestor
which was encouraged with cheers.</p><P>"You
kill this forest, you kill life!!" another person yelled followed
by 'Ya's and 'Speak it's from the other people. The
construction workers were scowling at them and yelling get out of the
way but not one person moved.</p><P>"Listen,
we're just trying to do our jobs, now MOVE!" the construction
workers yelled. In response the there was more yelling and protests.
This continued late in tonight until the construction workers had to
leave and go home. This was followed with cheers from the protestors
until one stepped out and walked in front of them with a serious
expression on his face. He flipped his long red hair over his
shoulders as his face broke out into a fox-ish grin and his red eyes
gleamed with mischief.</p><P>"Great
job today! We managed to drive them out for a third night in a row!"
Kyuubi yelled cheerfully to the crowd who began cheering. Kyuubi cut
them off with a raise of his hand. "However, we must not let our
guard down! They will probably bring more tomorrow. We must stay
strong! But tonight we celebrate!!"</p><P>After
he finished the crowd broke off into their own little circles. As the
crowd dispersed three people walked up to Kyuubi. Well, two walked
and one flung himself at Kyuubi who caught him in a fierce hug which
the other returned.</p><P>"Kyuubi!"
the small blond boy squealed while clutching his brother.</p><P>"Naruto,"
Kyuubi said back with a small smile as he set the younger boy down
and ruffled his hair. He turned to face the other two. "Status?"</p><P>A
woman stepped forward. Two long pig tails with flowers braided in
were resting on her shoulders. She was tall and wearing a simple
dress with v-neck that sowed off her humongous…(cough) well you get
the point. She began to speak, "I have gathered enough herbs for
medication to last us years. Without this forest where would Konoha
get all of its medication! I mean seriously!"</p><P>"I
know!" the man next to her agreed. He turned back to Kyuubi, his
brown hair swaying freely. He, out of habit, lightly scratched the
scar on his nose as he began to speak. "We also gathered plenty of
food. Enough to last us months to come!"</p><P>"Good
work Tsunade, Iruka. These construction workers have no idea who they
are dealing with," Kyuubi said with a smirk. "We've lived on
these grounds for years. We know the land far better then any other
random individual!"</p><P>The
two left after a nod of their heads. After they had joined their own
circles Kyuubi turned to Naruto with a smile that was reserved for
him only.</p><P>"So
did you help them too today?" Kyuubi asked kindly. Naruto just
pouted.</p><P>"Ya
but it was boring!!" Naruto said childishly. "I want to be out
with the protesters like you!!"</p><P>"No
way," Kyuubi said simply much to the annoyance of Naruto.</p><P>"Why
not?!" Naruto yelled pouting, crossing his arms, and stomping his
foot. "I'm 15 years old!"</p><P>"Well,
ya act like a five-year-old," Kyuubi said with a smirk as he saw
his brothers attempt at a glare. "My answer is still no. You'll
get yourself hurt."</p><P>"I-I
hate you!" Naruto yelled as he turned on his heel and ran off into
the woods. The older boy just sighed and waved off the looks people
were giving him. He headed back to his rather large (like a house)
tent that he and Naruto shared ever since their parents died in a
horrible accident.</p><P>"Gosh
Naruto," Kyuubi sighed and sat down on his futon which was next to
a small fire place. He sat there and waited for his foolish brother.</p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Well, there's the prologue!! Tell me if you liked it!</B></p><P><B>Kyuubi:
God Naruto is so childish! I can't believe I have to deal with
hime!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
Hey!!</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Meh he won't stay like that forever. It's just 'cause ya baby
him all the time!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
SEE!!</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
See it's called tough love! You gotta let him pick himself up! If
he gets a broken leg you gotta let him </B><I><B>feel</B></I><B> the
pain!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
Wait wha-?!?</B></p><P><B>Kyuubi:
Oh I see! I'll try and use that sometime! Thanks!!</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
YAY!! We all learned something today! And guess what? I'm setting a
date for chapter updates!!! The next chapter will be put up on
February 2, 2008!! So keep an eye open!</B></p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>Narufan4ev:
YES!! I did it!! I stuck to the time!!! WHOAA!!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
That's not a big deal… authors have been doing that for ages. YOU
were just too lazy.</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
SHUSHIE or else I'll make this story ItaNaru or better yet…
ITASASU!! Mwahahahahahahahaha!!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
(grabs a surprised Naruto out of nowhere) You wouldn't DARE…</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Oh I dare AND I select truth!!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
WEL- Wai- Wha?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Anyways moving on… TIME FOR THE STORY!!</B></p><P>Naruto
ran as far as his legs could carry him not even worrying about
getting lost. He could easily talk the animals into helping him back
home. He always had the strangest, yet useful, talents along with his
brother. It wasn't long before Naruto ended up at a river. He
always seemed to end up here when he was angry. The tranquility in
the surroundings would always soothe him.</p><P>"Stupid
older brother," Naruto said childishly while dipping his feet into
the water. "He thinks he's SO cool just 'cause he can flip his
hair! 'Oh look at me! I'm Kyuubi and I can flip my hair like a
girl!' HMPH! Who does he think he is to tell me what to do?!"</p><P>He
just sat there seething for a while, muttering words along the lines
of 'stupid' and 'Kyuubi' (A/N bet you can't guess what he's
saying! ), until he arrived at a solution to his problem, "I
could just go fight on my own! I mean I'm turning 16 in like a
week! That definitely entitles me to some say in what I do!"</p><P>Once
he was done finalizing his 'brilliant' plan he stood up and
started walking until he realized he was going the wrong way he was
currently in Lost-ville. Population: Him.</p><P>"No
problem, I'll just ask an animal," he reassured himself and
started looking around. Not one animal. "Hm, that's weird. They
must've been scared away by the heavy machinery…</p><P>"I'll
just wait 'til morning and follow the sun east," Naruto said with
a shrug. "This'll show Kyuubi I can take care of myself!"</p><P>He
then proceeded to find a soft spot in the Earth to lie down on.</p><P>-
the next day – with Kyuubi –</p><P>Kyuubi
woke up from his slumber groggily. He looked around after remembering
yesterday and when he found no Naruto erupted into panic. He ran out
of the tent to see everyone already awake and ready to protest.</p><P>"Kyuubi-san!
Good morning!" a cheerful voice from behind him. Kyuubi turned to
see Iruka.</p><P>"Iruka
have you seen Naruto?" Kyuubi asked calmly.</p><P>"No,
not since yesterday, why?" Iruka said with a worried frown. Before
Kyuubi could answer Tsunade ran up from behind them with a serious
expression.</p><P>"Kyuubi-san!"
she came to a stop in front of both men and gave a quick nod to Iruka
before turning to face Kyuubi. "They've brought the police
force!"</p><P>"This
won't be good," Kyuubi said as he began to think of what to do.
"You two tell the others to hold their positions until I come back.
I'm going to take Hinata and Kiba to help me find Naruto."</p><P>"Yes,"
Iruka and Tsunade said simultaneously. The two quickly went back to
the others. Kyuubi went to find Kiba and Hinata. As he searched for
them he sighed, <I>I have a bad feeling about today…</I></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Sorry it's so short… I'm too lazy to type anymore…</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Why must </B><I><B>we </B></I><B>have such a lazy writer?</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
Maybe we're just unlucky?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
You know I'm standing right here…(eyebrow twitches)</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Yea and?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Don't MAKE me sick Tsunade on you!!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
(shivers from previous memories) I'll be good now… (gets into
fetal position)</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
You ARE evil…</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Thank you! Next up date will be 2/9/08, k? See ya then!! </B></p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><B>Narufan4ev:
I'm baaaack!! And really pissed off!!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
…</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
…</B></p><P><B>Itachi:
Whoa…</B></p><P><B>Kyuubi:
(snore)</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Well?!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
What?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Aren't you going to ask me something?!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Ok… will you start the story already?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Grrr!! I'll tell you why I'm mad!! I got kicked off of Youtube!!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
(blush) You didn't post </B><I><B>those</B></I><B> videos did you?!
(glances at a blushing Sasuke)</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
NO!! Those are for personal use only… but apparently I did some
copyright things or something!! They didn't even send me an
e-mail!! I mean seriously!!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Oh woe is you! Now can we get to the story?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Fine okay!</B></p><P>Naruto
woke to find himself in the middle of the woods underneath a rather
large tree. He jumped up into a panic mode until he remembered what
happened yesterday. He calmed down and stretched.</p><P>"Well,
no point hangin' around here,"Naruto said with foxish
grin in place. He looked in front of him to see the sun rising. "Time
to protest!"</p><P><B>BANG!</B></p><P>He
turned around and ran smack dab into the tree he was previously
sleeping under. He stood there rubbing his head furiously for a few
minutes.</p><P>"Ok
time to protest <I>after</I> I walk around the tree!" he yelled,
back to his hyper self. He then walked around the tree. He walked for
a while following the sun. He stopped a couple of animals asked them
for directions. He also stopped a couple of times to eat some berries
he deemed safe.</p><P>After
walking for a while he finally began to see light coming through the
thick trees. He rushed towards the light (<B>A/N: NOO Naruto don't
head towards the light!! LOL Sorry</B>) and was abut to rush out of
the woods when a surprising sight hit his eyes. He quickly ducked
back behind a tree. In the clearing before him was a line of seven
police cars. There apparently weren't any officers, as Naruto
noticed, so he was about to walk out and try to find his way back to
camp when a voice stopped him.</p><P>"Well,
look what we found, brother," a thick voice said.</p><P>"Look
indeed," a second voice replied.</p><P>-with
Kyuubi-</p><P>Kyuubi
along with Kiba and Hinata had been looking for awhile. Kiba and his
dog, Akamaru, had traced Naruto's scent all the way up to the river
but because of the water, couldn't trace anymore. Hinata then used
her special eyes, that all of her family members had, to see Naruto's
light footprints. Kyuubi even asked a few animals who had seen him.
They were on the right track!!</p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
I'm… tired… Come back next week and blablabla…</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
Ok someone's a little out of it…</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Meh!! (lays down and turns the other way)</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Ladies and Gentlemen… the author…(sarcastic)</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Meh to you too!</B></p><P><B>Kyuubi:
(starts to wake up) Hmm? What happened?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Meh to you too, Kyuu!! (hehe rhymes)</B></p><P><B>Kyuubi:
Well, that is just plain rude!! (stomps off) (Itachi runs after)</B></p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P><B>Narufan4ev: Okay I'm
not completely horrible! Here is chapter 3.5!! At it's real length!</B></p><P><B>Naruto: Well, if
ya-!</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev: No
chit-chat! To the story!!!</B></p><P>-with Naruto-</p><P>Naruto was scared of
what he would find he turned around. He could hear footsteps behind
him coming closer but still Naruto refused to turn around.</p><P>"If it isn't one of
those hippies who are protesting," the first voice said with
amusement. "And a girl? What, did you get lost?"</p><P>If there was one thing
Naruto hated more then going without ramen (which he had to do that
morning so he was already testy) it was being called a girl. He spun
around on his heel angrily to face a surprised police officer.</p><P>"I am NOT a girl! And
I did NOT get lost!!" he screeched. After his anger slightly dimmed
he took a good look at the two slightly surprised officers. The two
looked almost identical except one was older. The older one had pitch
black hair tied back into a loose ponytail, pale and flawless skin,
and blood red eyes (<I>Probably contacts,</I> Naruto added in his
mind). The younger boy had blue tinted hair that spiked up in the
back giving him an odd yet cool look, ivory colored skin also
flawless, and pitch black eyes that at the moment showed arrogance.
They both wore the official police uniform with a red fan symbol on
the back. One thing for sure was that these two were incredibly
handsome. The charm, however, was broken when the younger boy stepped
forward with a large smirk on his face.</p><P>"Well, someone's a
little testy today," the younger said arrogantly. "And if you're
not lost how come you're about a mile away from your 'town'?"</p><P>"Wha?! A mile?!
Kyuubi is going to be so mad!" said Naruto worriedly almost
forgetting his audience of two police officers.</p><P>"Kyuubi? The leader
of this little uprising?" The older inquired quietly breaking
Naruto of his worrying. "Why would he care if one of his
subordinates got lost?"</p><P>"First of all, this
no just a little uprising! It is a serious issue!" Naruto retorted.
"Second of all, Kyuubi cares for all of his subordinates! He would
always protect them!"</p><P>"Oh really?" the
older one asked mockingly.</p><P>"Naruto!" a new
voice erupted from the trees revealing a frantic red head. When he
saw his brother his face lit but then he noticed the officers and
scowled at them. "I'm going to ask you to step away from my
brother."</p><P>"No, actually I kinda
like standing so close to him," the younger brunette said moving
closer to the blond and placing a hand on tan cheek making Naruto
blush. "I think he's kinda cute."</p><P>"Don't you <I>dare</I>
touch my brother!" Kyuubi shrieked while running towards the boy
near Naruto but was caught around the waist by the older boy.</p><P>"Don't you dare
touch <I>my </I>brother," the older said calmly holding Kyuubi
tighter around the waist with a permanent smirk. "Has anyone told
you that for the legendary Kyuubi you're awfully pretty?"</p><P>Kyuubi flushed a red
only one shade away from his hair. "W-What did you say?! Let go of
me!"</p><P>"Hey!! Kyuubi!"
Naruto yelled and slapped away the other boy's hand to try and run
towards Kyuubi. <I>Tried.</I> He was also caught around the waist by
the other boy. He began to kick and thrash to free himself from the
strong grip. "You are so lucky I'm a pacifist!"</p><P>"Ya lucky," the
other boy said sarcastically while keeping a firm hold on the
thrashing boy.</p><P>"That's it! I
didn't want to have to do this but you've pushed me to my limit!"
Kyuubi yelled frustrated. "I'm gonna have to call him! Naruto you
know what to do."</p><P>He then proceeded to
put two of his fingers to his mouth and make a high-pitched whistle.
The other two brothers looked towards the forest to see what would
immerge next. They waited a few moments before they heard rapid
footsteps coming towards them. In a flash a red and gold fox leaped
out of the trees and towards the older brunette. The fox then
proceeded to bite the startled boy.</p><P>"Shit!" he yelled
as he released Kyuubi fro m his hold to clutch at his throbbing leg.
Kyuubi quickly jumped onto the fox's back and they rode towards the
younger of the two brunettes. The fox bit the boy's arm and
forcibly removed him from Naruto, who, once he was freed, also jumped
onto the fox's back (<B>A/N: By the way it's a large fox.</B>)</p><P>"Ow! Shit!" the boy
yelled as he clutched at his arm.</p><P>"You guys shouldn't
use such vulgar language!" Kyuubi yelled mockingly to the other
pair of brothers, his own smirk forming. Naruto blew a raspberry at
them as the two rode back into the trees. After the pain wore down a
bit, the two brunettes stood up straight. The fox didn't bite hard
enough to break the skin. Only enough for it to surprise them and
maybe leave a bruise.</p><P>"That was foolish of
them," the older said as he observed his leg. "They should've
finished us off if they could. Are you okay Sasuke?"</p><P>"Ya, how about you
Itachi?" Sasuke asked as he observed his arm. He got a nod in
response. "But you know what? Those two interest me…"</p><P>"Me too," Itachi
said as he looked back to where the three had run off. They then
turned around and started to head where their comrades were. <I>Maybe
we'll meet again, </I>Itachi thought to himself.</p><P><B>Narufan4ev: Yes,
that was all supposed to be chapter three! But then I procrastinated
and didn't start typing 'til it was really late… so I was
really tired…</B></p><P><B>Naruto: Wow, how did
you pass school again?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev: Hmph! I
would've gotten an A- in English if not for that stupid essay!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke: Ya, ya
whatever.</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev: Well,
meh to you AGAIN!! Expect the next chapter 2/16/08!! See you then!! </B></p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Okay I'm updating AND it's still 2/16/08!!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
That took you-</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
No talkie! These kind people have been waiting over-(looks at watch)
- 12 hours!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
Fine jeez-</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
SHH!! On to the story!!</B></p><P>Naruto
was clutching Kyuubi tightly around the waist so he wouldn't fall
off the back of the zooming fox, which was dubiously named Kyuubi Jr.
Kyuubi ranting about how Naruto shouldn't have run off when they
met Hinata and Kiba by an ancient looking tree. Kyuubi didn't want
them to be put on the black list too so he told them to wait here.
They were overjoyed to see Naruto safe and sound and they both hugged
him tightly (well Hinata did Kiba gave him a punch to the head). They
then all proceeded to go back to camp, Kyuubi and Naruto riding on
Kyuubi Jr. and Hinata and Kiba on Akamaru. As soon as they got back
to camp Iruka ran up to them.</p><P>"Kyuubi-san!
The police are pushing through!" Iruka said worriedly. Kyuubi just
spun around to the other three (plus Akamaru, Kyuubi Jr. had already
run off).</p><P>"You
three follow us," Kyuubi said urgently and motioned for Iruka to
give him details.</p><P>"It's
not just any old police force it's the Uchiha Squad!" Iruka said
frantically. That stopped Kyuubi in his tracks.</p><P>"Are
you sure?" Kyuubi questioned. Iruka nodded and replied, "Yes, the
symbol unmistakable."</p><P>"I
thought so, but I wasn't sure," Kyuubi said. "Naruto those two
police officers we ran into had to be Itachi and Sasuke Uchiha."</p><P>"Who?"
Naruto said blankly.</p><P>"Weren't
you listening in class when I was talking about the past and present
of Konoha?" Iruka asked angrily. Naruto just sweat dropped and
rubbed the back of his head.</p><P>"Um…
no," Naruto said with a sheepish grin. But before Iruka could go on
rant about disrespectful students, Kyuubi cut him off.</p><P>"(sigh)
Itachi and Sasuke Uchiha are the heirs of the clan," Kyuubi said
exasperated. "They're also known to be prodigies."</p><P>"Those
two girly guys?" Naruto said before erupting into laughter.</p><P>"You
shouldn't be talking," Kyuubi mentioned which shut Naruto up. It
was true he had a lithe figure because of his diet of mostly ramen…</p><P>"Hey!
You're the one with long, girly hair!" Naruto countered. That
stopped Kyuubi completely. No one, and he MEANS no one, insults his
hair. He spun on his heel and faced his brother who didn't back
down and they both glared at each other.</p><P>"I'll
have you know my hair is perfect no matter what length and-!"
Kyuubi was cut off from his rant by Iruka.</p><P>"You
two stop fighting now!" Iruka ordered the two bickering brothers.
They both stopped right away. The expression Iruka was not one to be
ignored. Man, he can mean sometimes. "You have to protect this
forest remember?!"</p><P>"Uh,
right yes of course," Kyuubi said hurriedly and clearing his
throat. He began to walk again. "Hinata and Kiba you should join
the lines."</p><P>"Yes,"
the two answered in unison and ran to the lines.</p><P>"Okay
like I was saying, they are known prodigies and very dangerous,"
Kyuubi spoke professionally once again.</p><P>"Meh,
whatever," Naruto childishly answered. "If I stooped to such a
level as fighting I could've taken them."</p><P>"I'm
sure," Kyuubi said as they came to a stop in front of a long line
of Guardians. "Well, Naruto. You get your wish. Wanna try out that
new technique I showed you?"</p><P>Naruto's
eyes lit up and a huge smile was plastered onto his face. "Do you
mean it? Seriously?!"</p><P>"Sure,
knock yourself out," Kyuubi said and ordered for the lines to move
back as Naruto stepped forward. The police were about to move forward
when Naruto made a series of fast hand seals. When he finished he
slammed his hand into the ground and as he raised it vines erupted
from the ground making a wall and blocking off the stunned police.</p><P>"How
was that Kyuubi?" Naruto said excitedly as he maintained the amount
of chakra needed to hold the technique.</p><P>"Good
job! Now just keep concen-" Kyuubi was cut off however.</p><P>"Katon:
Gokayou No Jutsu!" there was shout from the other side of the wall.
Just like that the wall burst into flames. Naruto stood and watched
in horror as the wall burnt to the floor. On the other side stood
than the two Uchiha prodigies.</p><P>"Well,
well. We meet again," Itachi said in his higher-then-thou voice.
Naruto just stared at where his great wall once stood…</p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
And there you are! An update as good as good can be!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
But the question is… is good really that good?</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Well, it's certainly not great now is it?</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Well… it's better then bad!</B></p><P><B>Kyuubi:
That is true…</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Kyuubi!! You're back!! (glomps Kyuubi much to the anger of Itachi)</B></p><P><B>Kyuubi:
YAY! HUGS!!</B></p><P><B>Itachi:
Okay now let go of MY fox! (pulls on one of Kyuubi's arms)</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
You wait your turn! (pulls on Kyuubi's other arm)</B></p><P><B>Itachi:
He's mine!</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
NO Mine!!</B></p><P><B>Naruto

Woo-hoo…</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:

Well, quite frankly…</B></p><P><B>Naruto:

Well, don't you find talking to me interesting?</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Not particularly… </B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Well, I feel loved…</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
Fantastic!! Now onto the story!!</B></p><P>Kyuubi
stared as his brother slowly lowered his head. Kyuubi knew this was a
signal. He knew what was coming next and he quickly ordered the lines
to move backwards. He quickly backed up along with them all the while
staring at his brother.</p><P>"You
people have gone too far… Killing this forest for your own selfish
desires," Naruto said quietly before his head snapped back up to
show one of fury. His whiskers now more defined and his previously
blue eyes, now blood red and slitted. "I WILL NOT STAND FOR IT!"</p><P>He
then launched himself at Sasuke at an alarmingly fast pace. He
slashed with his newly formed claws at any part of the Uchiha he
could reach. Sasuke blocked as much possible against the demon,
slightly startled at the new attitude.</p><P>"Well,
so much for pacifist," Sasuke said sarcastically while blocking a
new blow from Naruto. "But he is cute when he's angry."</p><P>"Shut
up you, asshole!" Naruto yelled slashing out at Sasuke's face
which was blocked.</p><P>"It
was just a few vines. What are you so angry about?" Sasuke asked
calmly.</p><P>"It
was NOT 'just a few vines'! That was LIFE! That was something
that lost its life because of you! For no reason at all!" Naruto
attacked with new vigor and aimed a powerful kick at Sasuke.</p><P>"It
was a plant nothing more. What a stupid reason to fight for, idiot."
Sasuke blocked the kick with his forearm, then caught Naruto's leg
and pushed it so the blond would fall backwards. Naruto quickly
balanced and lunged himself at Sasuke.</p><P>"You
black-hearted-!" As Naruto was about to throw a punch Itachi
quickly came up behind and landed a hit onto Naruto's neck to knock
him out (he slowly changed back) and he collapsed into Sasuke's
arms. Before he fell fully unconscious he muttered, "Ass-holes…"</p><P>"Sasuke
I'm pretty sure egging him on wasn't the best idea," Itachi
said helping lift the blond fully into younger boy's arms.</p><P>"Meh,"
Sasuke shrugged and started to turn around before they heard a shout
from behind them.</p><P>"Naruto!
Where are you taking him?!" Kyuubi yelled while running towards the
three. As he ran he quickly performed hand seals and vines shot from
the ground. They were about to grab Naruto when a silver-haired man
wearing a half mask stepped in front and took the hit instead. Kyuubi
pulled him anyways. "I don't want it to have to come to this but
give Naruto back or we'll keep… this silver-haired guy!"</p><P>"Hmm,"
Itachi made a thoughtful expression. "Nah, Kakashi can take care of
himself."</p><P>"You're
horrible! Don't you even care about your subordinate?!" Kyuubi
questioned angrily.</p><P>"Hey,
we didn't order him to jump in front of Naru-chan here," Sasuke
said with a small smirk and motioning towards the unconscious boy in
his arms. The two then turned fully around and began to walk away.
Not even listening to Kyuubi's yells.</p><P>"Don't
worry Naruto I'll get you back!" Kyuubi yelled us the two boys
disappeared off into the distance. When he couldn't see them
anymore he turned angrily on his heel. "I knew I shouldn't have
let him fight! He obviously wasn't ready! I am such a push-over! I
should've punished him for that disappearing act he pulled-!"</p><P>"Sounds
like you really care about him," said a quiet voice. Kyuubi seemed
startled by the sudden interruption. He turned around to see Kakashi
being dragged along by a vine.</p><P>"Oh!
I'm sorry. I don't want to have to do this to you. No creature
should be imprisoned," Kyuubi said with an apologetic smile. "I
just… want my brother back so much."</p><P>"It's
fine. I've definitely been through much worse," Kakashi with a
curved eye, signifying that he was smiling. He then began to look
around at the area. "This place is almost like a real town."</p><P>"It
is a real town. A very peaceful town too," Kyuubi said with a
gentle smile. "Our ancestors have been even before Konoha. Naruto's
and my great-great-great grandfather Sarutobi the Wise started it."</p><P>"So
that makes you practically royalty," Kakashi pointed out.</p><P>"I
prefer not to have such a title. That would make me higher then my
comrades," Kyuubi stated. "Right now they only come to me for
advice and occasionally leadership."</p><P>"Hmm,
interesting," Kakashi said. They continued to walk down a line of
tents until they came to a small one right at the end of the line.</p><P>"Here
we are. This is an extra tent we keep for new-comers until they can
buy, make, or find their own," Kyuubi stated and lead Kakashi in.</p><P>"Find?"
Kakashi asked with a raised eyebrow. Kyuubi just shrugged and then
proceeded to light a small fire and unroll a sleeping bag from the
corner.</p><P>"I'm
sorry but you'll have to stay in here. I will send someone to take
care of you," Kyuubi said and shuffled out.</p><P>"Man,
they treat prisoners well," Kakashi said while collapsing onto the
sleeping bag.</p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
It is done!!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P><B>A/N:
Hi everybody. I'm really sorry about this but because I am sick I
will not be able to post a chapter this week. I'm really, really
sorry because I know my other chapters haven't been the longest but
it's taking all my will power just to type this up… If it makes
you feel any better I couldn't even go to my friend's sleepover
she invited me to! Once again I'm really, really, REALLY sorry
about this and I hope none of you catch something like this. Next
week's chapter will be very long, k? I promise!</B></p><P><B>-Narufan4ev</B></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Sorry about last week, but here ya go! A new chappy!!</B></p><P><B>Naruto:
Finally…</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Hey! I found a Pop-tart in my backpack!! YAY!!!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke:
Wow random much…</B></p><P>-with
Naruto-</p><P>Naruto
woke to a warm feeling. He was completely surrounded by warmth and
decided to burrow deeper. He wanted to go back to sleep and his
sleeping bag has never been this warm- wait a second! He shot up and
found himself in a strange room and more importantly a strange room.
He quickly scrambled out from under the covers, lost his balance, and
landed with a soft 'thump' on the hard wood floor beneath him.</p><P>"Where
am I?" he asked no one in particular while rubbing his backside.
Just then his memories began to flash back behind his eyes. He
remembered his wall being burnt down and being extremely angry then…
everything went black. But he remembered being carried away by-
"Sasuke!"</p><P>Just
then the door opened and in came the brunette himself with a smug
look on his face when he saw Naruto was awake and glaring at him. "I
see you're up."</p><P>"What
am I doing here you- you-!" Naruto just couldn't find the right
word to describe this very aggravating person.</p><P>"Bastard?
Asshole?" Sasuke offered setting down a tray of food he brought
with him.</p><P>"I
would never say that!" Naruto yelled stubbornly.</p><P>"You
didn't seem to mind when we were fighting," Sasuke said taking a
seat in front of the blond.</p><P>"I
don't fight, remember? Hello, pacifist?" Naruto said while
rolling his eyes. "And my brother called you guys prodigies!"</p><P>Then
in the blink of an eye Naruto had Sasuke by the collar of his smirk
leaving Sasuke to raise his eyebrow. "But I'm not above threats…
now let me go or else you'll wish you weren't born!"</p><P>"Ya,
whatever. I've had that feeling before. It's not that bad,"
Sasuke said with a forming smirk and he pried the tan hand off his
shirt and clutched it in his hand. "Got any better threats?"</p><P>"I-I-I-"
the smaller boy stuttered out quite surprised at the brunettes
reaction. To cover it up he glared at the taller boy wrenched his
hand out of his grasp.</p><P>"That's
what I thought, all bark and no bite," Sasuke said sitting back
comfortably. "But I suppose it was a nice try. Maybe if you had
more of a killer's intent…"</p><P>"Hmph,"
Naruto answered back to him. "It's sounds as if you're going to
train me our something."</p><P>"Who
knows but for now eat," Sasuke said pushing the tray towards
Naruto.</p><P>"I
would never take anything from you," Naruto said with a pout and
turning back to the wall beside the bed, arms crossed. However, he
took a glance at the tray of food. "But just to clarify, what is
it?"</p><P>"Chicken
noodle soup, jello, bread and crackers, and some water," Sasuke
said to an appalled Naruto.</p><P>"So
you chopped up a chicken, threw its flesh into a pot of oil, broth,
and noodles and then you ground up the bones of a cow, and served it
all to me on a silver platter?" Naruto said all the while gagging.
"Sounds tempting, but no thanks. But I will keep the bread and
water."</p><P>"That's
all you're gonna eat?" Sasuke said with a raised eyebrow.</p><P>"I
won't eat the flesh of another being," Naruto said indigently as
he grabbed the bread and crackers. He was about to put the bread in
his mouth when he paused. "Was this made with eggs?"</p><P>"Yes,"
Sasuke stated and watched as the blond dropped the bread and crackers
back onto the tray. "Are you vegan?"</p><P>"Yes,
I am. And I'm proud of it!" Naruto said as he grabbed the water
and quickly drank.</p><P>"Wow,
it's gonna bee hard finding you something to eat," Sasuke said as
an after thought.</p><P>"Ya,
so you should just let me go," Naruto said with mock sigh.</p><P>"Nope
we need you to lure Kyuubi out of the forest," Sasuke said with a
shrug.</p><P>"Do
you actually think that would work?" Naruto said with a blank
expression. "Kyuubi knows that I would give up my life for that
forest so good luck with that!"</p><P>"Hn,"
was all that Sasuke said before picking up the tray and walking
towards the door. "I'll try to find something for you to eat."</p><P>"Hmph,"
Naruto said childishly.</p><P>-in
the forest-</p><P>-Iruka
POV-</p><P><I>I
hate that man, </I>I thought as I left his tent for the fiftieth time
today. I mean what is his problem?!</p><P>It
is so aggravating when I go in and try to actually start a
conversation and he just spurts out perverted nonsense! And then he
has the audacity to order <I>ME </I>around?! Iruka stopped just to
stomp his feet angrily. <I>Darn! Darn! Darn! I just want to punch
something!</I></p><P>"Oh,
Iruka-chan!" called a voice from the previously left tent making me
shudder. I turned around and stomped back into the tent.</p><P>"Yes,
Hatake-san?" I said with barely suppressed anger to the
white-haired man and that irritating curved eye. <I>And who said he
could use my first name!?</I></p><P>"I
was just wondering if I could get an extra pillow and blanket? It's
pretty cold," Kakashi asked, his eye glinted as he continued on.
"By the way do you have any meat?"</p><P>"Um,
no I don't have any meat," Iruka ground out. <I>How many times do
I need to tell him we are a vegan community!?</I></p><P>"Oh,
then why are you so flat?" he asked as his eye curved.</p><P>"Wai-Wha-?"
I stuttered but then blushed furiously when I caught onto his
meaning. "You PERVERT!"</p><P>"So
you do?" Kakashi said with ock wonder and smirked (well you could
tell by his eye). "I wonder if it tastes good."</p><P>That
caused me to turn completely red. "You- you-you-!"</p><P>"Ahaha
you're so cute when you're embarrassed!" Kakashi said with a
curved eye. That <I>infuriating </I>curved eye!</p><P>"I <I>really </I>hate you," I said bitterly and stormed out of
the tent in a huff. <I>Darn him! Darn him to heck!</I></p><P><B>Narufan4ev: Well, there you go! Man for me that was really long!</B></p><P><B>Naruto: That was barely long!</B></p><P><B>Sasuke: Ya! You just </B><I><B>barely </B></I><B>got past 1,000
words!</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev: Okay so it's a little on the shorter then you were
expecting side </B><I><B>but </B></I><B>I wasn't even going to add
in that whole KakaIru part until next chapter!</B></p><P><B>Naruto: (shakes head disappointingly) You sicken me…</B></p><P><B>Narufan4ev: (runs off to emo corner) WAAAHHH!! Naruto hates me!! </B></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><p><b>Narufan4ev:
I know, Iknow. Where the hell have I been?</b></p><p><b>Naruto:
Yea! It's way past afternoon now!</b></p><p><b>Narufan4ev:
What? So I like to sleep in on weekends! Sue me!</b></p><p><b>Sasuke:
Maybe we will…</b></p><p><b>Narufan4ev:
Um… (backs away slowly)</b></p><p>-with
Kyuubi-</p><p>Kyuubi
was in turmoil on the inside. He wanted his brother back and he
wanted him back NOW! He couldn't sleep without Naruto's constant
jabbering and his life was awfully dull without their bickering and
making up. He pulled at his red hair in frustration.</p><p>"What
am I going to do?!" Kyuubi yelled in distress. "Naruto wouldn't
want me to give up the forest but that's exactly what they want me
to do! And they apparently can get by without Kakashi…"</p><p>Then
it clicked in his mind. <i>What if he's a spy?!</i> With that in
mind Kyuubi quickly stood from his sitting position and rushed out of
his tent.</p><p>-Sasuke
POV-</p><p>I
walked down the hallway to the blonde's room holding a tray with
new food he'll hopefully find acceptable. I don't even know why I
care anyways. He's just a prisoner; here until they've relieved
their debt or served their purpose. I don't really care about the
prisoners anyways. I mean, Uchiha Sasuke, take care of anyone but
himself? That's unheard of! But there was just something about this
blond… I slowly came to a stop in front of his room and opened the
door to see him sitting in the corner looking at nothing in
particular. His sapphire eyes carried a distant look like he was in a
different world at the moment.</p><p>"What
are you doing?" I asked with caution just in case he was doing some
weird hippie ritual or something. Hey, you never know. He seemed to
snap to attention at my voice though and focused his eyes on. I would
be lying if I said I wasn't slightly unnerved by his eyes that
seemed to look into my soul.</p><p>"Hm?
Oh I was just thinking," he said absentmindedly taking his eyes
away from mine. However, he peered at me suspiciously when I walked
farther into the room. "What are you doing here anyways? Why would
the 'Uchiha prodigy/prick' care about a lowly prisoner? Why don't
you just get a guard or something for my meals?"</p><p>"Well,
I'm the only one who knows you're vegan and we don't want you
starving now, do we?" I answered making the excuse up totally in an
instant. Who said I really understood myself? He looked up curiously
at the tray, buying my excuse. "I brought miso ramen."</p><p>"M-Miso
ramen?" Naruto said unsure as he stood slowly from his position.
Did I insult him or something? What if it's like a banished food or
something? Or so sacred they aren't allowed to eat it?! Wait it's
ramen what am I thinking? The next second I found myself lying on my
back on the floor with the tray knocked off to the side, and the bowl
of broth and noodles sitting in the hand of the blond currently
sitting on top of me. He seemed to take no notice of me however and
kissed the bowl of ramen. Yes, he <i>kissed </i> it. "Oh ramen! I
haven't seen you for three days! Why must you continuously run from
my grasp? You are the light in my eyes, the spring in my step, the-!"</p><p>I
sat (laid) there, in this incredibly compromising position, listening
to Naruto's 'Ode to Ramen' for a good 15 minutes until I
decided enough was enough. "Excuse me?"</p><p>"-your
taste that of the food Gods! Hm?" he finally looked down to see me
underneath him and, blushing darkly, quickly scrambled off of me
leaving me to sit and dust myself off. "Sorry, it's just I
haven't had ramen in three days!"</p><p>"Yea,
yea whatever, just never do that again," I said crossing my legs
and fighting the blush that almost came to my cheeks. "I'm glad I
actually found a food you like."</p><p>"Hey
you know why don't you just tell the cook I'm vegan and be done
with it?" Naruto asked bringing up the earlier topic in between
huge gulps of broth.</p><p>"The
cook wouldn't be used to cooking vegan dishes and you're so weak
and vulnerable that if I told one of the guards to bring your food
who knows what those idiots would do?" I said with a shrug as
Naruto spluttered and choked on the noodles he was just swallowing.</p><p>"W-What
did you just say?!" I can take care of myself, thank you very
much!" Naruto said with clenched fists.</p><p>"And
you being a pacifist and all you probably wouldn't even hit them if
they tried to have their way with you," I continued getting really
pissed at the non-existent guards who even dared to come into my
imagination… and have their way with the blond… Whatever! You get
the idea; I was really pissed off at them!</p><p>"You know self-defense and just randomly beating someone up are two
different things!" he yelled furiously, a dark blush appearing on
his face. I looked at him with a smirk and got my knees. I slowly
started to crawl towards him which took him aback if the dropping of
his chopsticks and his blush growing said anything.</p><p>"Oh
really, then why don't you show me some of your moves," I said
seductively stopping right in front of him and touching his thigh
gently. His breath hitched and just sat there staring. I gave him
another smirk and lent back away from him. He seemed to regain some
consciousness as he glared embarrassed at me. I couldn't stop the
chuckle that left my mouth. "That's what I thought, idiot."</p><p>"Y-You
just took me by surprise!" he yelled and quickly picked up his
chopsticks and continued to eat (eww) in a huff. "Why would you
care anyways?!"</p><p>I
just shrugged and sat there smirk still in place. When he realized
that he wasn't getting an answer he hurriedly ate his ramen. When
he finished I took the bowl, laced it on the forgotten tray, and
stood to leave. As I opened the door I said to him, "You get two
meals a day and two showers a week. I suggest you get some sleep."</p><p>"Hmph!"
was his only answer.</p><p><b>Narufan4ev:

1: Make them go away! Make them go away!! (cowering)</B></P><P><B>Naruto:
Right… on to the story!!</B></P><P>Kyuubi
stared at the scene in front of in surprise and slight amusement.
<I>Well, this wasn't what I was expecting, </I>he thought. He was
expecting to see Kakashi sitting on his sleeping bag, maybe in a
bored reverie, and reading that book he seemed to like a lot. But
what he was absolutely not expecting to see was Iruka lying on top of
Kakashi (quite promiscuously) with pillows and blankets surrounding
them.</P><P>-Flashback-</P><P><I>Iruka
heatedly carried two large pillows and blankets towards his most
hated person's tent. He could barely see over the pile but he made
it anyways. As he quickly opened the tent he wasn't paying
attention to the ground where there was an innocently placed rock.
Iruka suddenly found himself falling towards the ground, pillows and
blankets flying everywhere. He closed his eyes and waited for the
oncoming hit.</I></P><P>"<I>Iruka!"
there was a shout from the side as Kakashi scrambled forward and
cushioned Iruka's fall with his own body. Iruka's eye's flew
open when he heard a soft grunt underneath him instead of hitting the
ground. He looked down at Kakashi who looked back up and into his
eyes. "Are you okay?"</I></P><P>"<I>U-Um
ya-" Iruka said blushing and stuttering as he began to pick himself
up. But then someone else entered the tent.</I></P><P>"<I>Kakashi
I want to talk-" Kyuubi cut off however when he saw the position
the two were in.</I></P><P>-end
flashback-</P><P>"I-It's
not what it looks like!" Iruka assured hurriedly as he scrambled
off of Kakashi who sat up with a slightly disappointed face. "I
tripped and-and-"</P><P>"It's
alright you don't have to explain to me," Kyuubi said kindly.
"You're older then me I'm sure you know what you're doing.
You're free to pursue any relationship you deem worthy."</P><P>"I-him-we're-
It's not like that!" Iruka yelled embarrassed and flustered. "I
tripped, he caught me and that's all!"</P><P>"Ok,
ok Iruka. I understand," Kyuubi said calmly. "I came in here to
ask Kakashi some questions. May we have privacy?"</P><P>"Y-Yes
Kyuubi," Iruka said and stood up to leave the tent. Once he left
Kyuubi turned to Kakashi with a serious face. "First of all, Iruka
is like a father to me and if you dare hurt him I'm not too
peaceful to not be able to hurt you."</P><P>"I
understand, and I have no intention of hurting him," Kakashi
answered with as much seriousness as Kyuubi. Kyuubi observed for
minute to see if he was lying before he nodded his approval and took
a seat in front of Kakashi.</P><P>"Good,
now I have some questions for you."</P><P>"Ask
away."</P><P>"Are
you or have you ever been a spy?"</P><P>"No."</P><P>"Why
did you jump in front of Naruto?"</P><P>"To
protect the heirs."</P><P>"I
only wanted Naruto."</P><P>"Yes,
but they need Naruto," Kakashi said. Kyuubi perked up at this.
<I>Finally we're getting somewhere.</I></P><P>"What
could they possibly need from my brother?" Kyuubi inquired.</P><P>"I'm
sorry but that is confidential information but I can say he has a
purpose," Kakashi stated while his visible eye curved into an
upside down u. "And I have suspicions that young Sasuke-chan has an
interest in your brother!"</P><P>"What
gave you that idea?!" sputtered Kyuubi.</P><P>"Well,
while they were fighting I noticed Sasuke never attacked and just
blocked," Kakashi stated. "Trust me. I was the one to help train
him and he's more of a 'kill now, ask the dead corpse questions
next' kind of person. That is unless he didn't want to actually
hurt the person."</P><P>"That's
the exact opposite of Naruto," Kyuubi said.</P><P>"I'm
pretty sure he didn't even notice himself. Poor kids' probably
confused out of his mind!" Kakashi cackled gleefully.</P><P>"I
can tell you really care about him," Kyuubi said. Note the sarcasm.</P><P>"Don't
let the laugh fool you! I really do care a lot about him!" Kakashi
giggled. "It's just so much fun teasing him! He's like my own
personal soap opera!"</P><P>"Uh-huh,
well I just wanted to ask you a few questions," Kyuubi said with
finality and stood from has spot. "With that good night and I hope
you're comfortable."</P><P>"Wow
this is like the best prison ever," Kakashi said with awe. "I'm
in a nice comfortable sleeping bag, I have a brunette cutie waiting
hand and foot on me, and people are even wishing me good nights! I
never want to leave!"</P><P>"Well,
I'm glad you feel that way," Kyuubi said letting some amusement
into his voice as he left and headed towards his own tent. <I>Now
that that's settled, a way to get Naruto back…</I></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
There you are! Brilliant I know!!</B></P><P><B>Naruto:
Ya, keep telling yourself that…</B></P><P><B>Itachi:
Okay I am getting really pissed off! I haven't shown up for like 16
chapters!!</B></P><P><B>Sasuke:
There are only 8…</B></P><P><B>Kyuubi:
And when is the ItaKyuu gonna start?! I'm getting impatient…</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Soon, dear Kyuubi, soon…</B></P><P><B>Itachi:
Well, make it SOONER!</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Okay, okay!! (starts rewriting chapters quickly)</B></P><P><B>Sasuke:
Well, next chapter will be up… is there a 31 in March?</B></P><P><B>Naruto:
I don't know.</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Wait… (to the internet!)… YEP!</B></P><P><B>Sasuke:
Okay! Then the next chapter will be up 4/12/08, right?</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
That sounds about right! Just look for it on a Saturday! See you
then! </B></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 11</h3><hr><br>Narufan4ev: Okay don't kill<P><B>Narufan4ev:
Okay don't kill!! For I have an offering!</B></P><P><B>Naruto:
Ya sure you do…</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
No, I'm serious!! An extra long CHAPTER!!WHOA!</B></P><P><B>Sasuke:
We shall see…</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Hmph, bastard…</B></P><P><B>Sasuke:
Thank you.</B></P><P>A
sigh slipped past Naruto's lips as he turned over on to his side
for the 15th time in a half an hour. Why was Naruto so
restless you ask? Well, quite frankly… he was bored. He had been
there for a day now and nothing had happened! <I>I mean not even
torturing?! Aren't they even going to question me? </I>Something<I>?!
</I>Naruto sat up suddenly with another dramatic sigh. <I>Wait why do
I have a bed? Shouldn't be like chained to wall or something?</I><B>(A/N:
Kinky ) </B><I>I wouldn't expect anything less from these guys…</I></P><P>Naruto
pouted before getting rid of the idea. It's not like he'd ever
been a prisoner before so how would he know? He stood from his bed
and sat on the ground cross-legged. He always could concentrate
better when he was closer to the ground… He sat on the cold stone
ground and leaned on the light blue wall with his eyes closed in a
meditative state.</P><P><I>Okay,
escape plan… well as far as I know I'm in… a building… of
sorts. And I don't know how far away from the forest I am… and
I'm basically screwed… fantastic, </I>was what was running
through Naruto's head at the moment. He opened his eyes with yet
another sigh. He slumped against the wall and let his head slump back
as he thought of different plans. He snapped out of his reverie when
he heard footsteps coming down the hall. They weren't Sasuke's
because first of all: Sasuke didn't wear high-heels and second,
Sasuke wasn't that light. He snapped to full attention when his
door opened with a creak. I stared at what I saw.</P><P>A
girl with shockingly pink hair and bright green eyes popped her head
through the doorway. They stood (and sat) there staring at each other
for before a frown appeared on the girl's face. She stepped fully
into the room to show that she was wearing a maid's outfit and had
a small figure. She eyed was more over before she huffed angrily.</P><P>"<I>You're
</I>what <I>my </I>Sasuke-kun's been paying so much attention to?"
she said angrily. "Ugh, what's so special about you!?"</P><P>"Um,
who <I>are </I>you?" Naruto asked a little put off. I mean it's
not like he wanted to be here anyways and she comes up yelling at
<I>him</I>? What the heck?</P><P>"<I>I
</I>am Sakura Haruno, future wife to Sasuke Uchiha and don't you
forget that!" she said glaring at him and exaggerating every word
with a point of her finger. "But I wouldn't expect some savage
boy to know any of that."</P><P>Okay
<I>that </I>threw Naruto over the edge. This (female dog in colorful
language) had the <B>audacity </B>to call <I>him </I>a savage when
her own voice resembled that of a monkey?! Hoe dare she! Naruto
jumped to his feet angrily. "<I>What </I>did you just call me?"</P><P>"Hmph,
you heard me savage," she just didn't know when to stop, did she?
"I don't see why Sasuke-kun doesn't just burn down the whole
forest. All I've learned about you people is that you're slackers
who lie around the forest. You don't even have money!"</P><P>"Listen
lady I don't know what your problem is but I think you need some
medication for so go away and come back when it's gone," Naruto
said, anger bubbling up inside him. This girl was about one word a
away from being beaten- I mean having a serious scolding… one so
hot it'll burn her to a crisp!- no wait…</P><P>"What?!"
she screeched making Naruto wince at the pitch. He had very sensitive
ears. Sakura was basically fuming now.</P><P>"I
don't need this right now… I'm in a very foul mood and you're
really testing my patience and my beliefs," Naruto said simply as
he calmly sat back on the floor. <I>Okay Naruto, go to your happy
place… happy place…</I></P><P>"I
still don't see what makes you so special other then your extreme
rudeness," Sakura hissed. Naruto just scoffed at her statement and
was about to answer when the rooms door opened once again to reveal
Sasuke carrying a tray. Sakura turned towards him with puppy eyes
clung to his arm in an instant, not spilling the food. "Oh,
Sasuke-kun! You should've heard what this <I>ingrate</I> said to
me! He was so horrible!"</P><P>"Hn,"
was Sasuke's reply as he set the tray down in front of Naruto. It
was the normal meal of miso ramen, water, and some vegan bread (store
bought). Naruto smiled up at him and began to eat. Sasuke just
smirked back at him, wrenched his arm from Sakura's vice grip, and
sat down in front of him.</P><P>"Um,
Sasuke-kun what are you doing?" Sakura asked stunned. He just
looked up at her with a blank expression.</P><P>"Oh,
ya Sakura they need you in the kitchen or something," he said as an
after thought before turning back to Naruto completely ignoring her.
She stood there stunned looking between Naruto and Sasuke before
glaring at Naruto, stomping out of the room and slamming the door
shut. "(sigh) So annoying…"</P><P>"What
is her problem?" Naruto asked through mouths of ramen. "I mean
she comes in here yelling at me for being here! What the heck?"</P><P>"Ya
she's just a little weird. I don't know why she hasn't been
fired yet, she hardly works anyways," Sasuke said tiredly.</P><P>"And
apparently she's your future wife so you'd better watch out,"
Naruto continued with a giggle and moving onto the bread.</P><P>"Ya,
she's delusional along with most of the girls around here,"
Sasuke said. Naruto's ears perked at this.</P><P>"So
where are we?" Naruto asked as if it was an everyday question.
Sasuke glanced at him with a smirk.</P><P>"It
would defeat the whole purpose of not having windows if I told you,"
Sasuke said.</P><P>"What,
why?!" Naruto whined.</P><P>"It's
a precaution. We don't know what kind of powers you guys might
have," Sasuke said leaning back on a wall and closing his eyes.</P><P>"Whatever,
I probably don't need it anyways!" Naruto said childishly and
glancing at Sasuke's still form. His dark bangs were covering his
closed eyes and his chest went up and down showing he was in deep
relaxation. Naruto could tell it wasn't very often Sasuke let his
guard down just from looking at his eyes… Naruto blushed when he
realized he had been staring and quickly tried to start a
conversation. "So I can see why you hang out in here if everybody
is like that."</P><P>"Yep,
so far you're the least annoying person so far, other then my
brother, and that's saying something," Sasuke answered opening
one eye a crack and a hint of a smirk on his face again. "And plus
there aren't many boys around here my age. So it was either this or
hang out with Itachi who is always busy."</P><P>"Must
be lonely," Naruto commented.</P><P>"Nah,
I'm used to it and plus tormenting you is fun," Sasuke said as he
stood up and picked up the empty tray.</P><P>"HEY!"</P><P>"See
ya later," Sasuke said before winking teasingly and leaving the
room with a rather miffed and flustered Naruto.</P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Once again I am so sorry this is late but don't you fear!! NEVER
AGAIN!!</B></P><P><B>Sasuke:
I bet she won't last.</B></P><P><B>Naruto:
I'll take that bet!</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
You're all against me!!</B></P><P><B>Sasuke:
Ya and?</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
WAAAAHHHH!! (runs out of the room crying)</B></P><P><B>Naruto:
Well, come back here 4/26/08 (hopefully)!</B></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 12</h3><hr><br>Narufan4ev: Well, here I am once again… writing this story… and for what<P><B>Narufan4ev: Well,
here I am once again… writing this story… and for what? Repeated
comments (cough</B><B>dragonfire04</B><B>cough)!
Seriously people! I didn't want to be one of those authors who
don't update unless they get 5 comments or something but if I have
to resort to that… I'll do it! Hey, reviews are a commodity these
days!</B></P><P><B>Naruto: Wow, you're
desperate aren't you?</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev: Yes, yes
I am.</B></P><P><B>Sasuke: Hmm, I like
the way you think…</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev: (le
gasp) Did you just COMPLIMENT </B><I><B>me?! </B></I><B>Are you sick?</B></P><P><B>Sasuke: No, I'm
just that evil.</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev: Oh,
okay! Oh and by the way if ANY of the comments are repeating, they
don't count! Well, onto the story!</B></P><P>Kyuubi was a mess. His
once perfectly combed and shiny hair was now tangled and dull. His
healthy tan color seemed to have dulled to a pale yellow and his eyes
were dilated and sunken from lack of sleep. The tent around him
seemed to be reflecting his inner turmoil because it was utter chaos
with papers crumpled and thrown away and the fire place's ashes
unswept and scattered to the winds. The only thing untouched by the
chaos was Naruto's sleeping area which seemed to be waiting for its
owner. Kyuubi, at the moment, sat on his own sleeping bag crouched
over a piece of paper he was scribbling on and mumbling to himself.
An aggravated growl erupted from his throat as he crumpled up the
paper and tossed it over his shoulder.</P><P>"Ugh! They'll
expect me that way!" he growled as he grabbed a new piece of paper
from a stack next to him and began writing once more. Suddenly his
tent opened in the front to show Tsunade peering in and frowning when
she saw the state Kyuubi was in. Kyuubi winced at the light that
poured into the room. "What? Can't you see I'm busy?"</P><P>"Kyuubi… have you
been neglecting sleep?" she asked as if it wasn't obvious and she
took a step inside closing the flap. Kyuubi glared at her.</P><P>"Of course I have! I
have to make a plan to get Naruto back because apparently nobody else
cares enough about him to help!" Kyuubi snapped.</P><P>"Of course we care!
How could we not-"</P><P>"Then why aren't
you helping?!" Kyuubi shrieked and clutched at his locks
frustrated. "Grrr I'm so angry! You're all hypocrites! You say
you want to help but you do nothing! Nothing for Naruto! Nothing for
me! Nothing after everything we've done for you! Nothing-!"</P><P>Tsunade quickly hit a
pressure point on his neck making him pass out and forcing him to
sleep. She effortlessly caught his small body and let out a sad sigh.</P><P>"I'm sorry
Kyuu-kun… we really do care and you just don't see that we're
all suffering," she murmured to the softly breathing boy as she
laid him down. "But don't worry… we'll make a plan."</P><P>-- a week later—</P><P>--with Naruto—</P><P>It had been too long
since he had seen his brother, and it had taken it's tole on
Naruto. At the moment he was way too grumpy for anything. Not even
the sweet taste of Ramen in his mouth could sooth him. And the daily
visits from Sakura now weren't helping. Everyday she'd come in
and lecture him on how '<I>she would be the heir of the Uchiha
family, don't you know?!</I>' and how '<I>isn't Sasuke the
hottest thing that ever touched the Earth?! I'm surprised it
doesn't burn up in flames from having him walk!</I>' oh and the
ever popular '<I>Eeeeeee!! OMG Sasuke is SO hot and sexy it should
be a crime!</I>'. Naruto was starting to get the feeling that in
Sakura's warped mind he was somewhat of a 'girlfriend' to her,
so he was guessing she must be pretty desperate for attention because
all he did during her little speeches was stare blankly at the wall
as if trying to drill a hill through it with his eyes. But it seemed
that every time this happened he was rescued by Sasuke and Sakura was
sent away. In fact they had gotten closer over this week and Naruto
could even make him <I>laugh!</I> Yes, that's right laugh. It was
one of the few things that he liked about being here. And he was
noticing a lot more stuff about Sasuke…</P><P>1: Sasuke hates sweets.</P><P>2: Sasuke hates fake
people.</P><P>And most of all 3:</P><P>Sasuke was lonely.</P><P>From what Naruto could
Sasuke's family wasn't very close-knit. It was all work and no
play and Sasuke's only real friend was his brother, which means he
had a serious brother complex. Every other word that came out of his
mouth was about his brother. Not that Naruto was much better. Even
though there were kids his age around him most of his childhood and
he had friends he still looked up to his brother most of all. In
fact, most of his childhood was spent stalking his brother. Though at
first it annoyed Kyuubi he soon began to give in to the adorable
puppy eyes Naruto blasted him every time he would complain.</P><P>Anyways, Naruto found
himself feeling sorry for Sasuke not matter how much of a prick he
was. And plus he brought Naruto ramen everyday! But there was one
question Naruto could not answer himself: If Kyuubi comes to rescue
him, could he let himself leave or stay and try and help Sasuke?</P><P>Just then an alarm went
off in the hall and Naruto turned towards the door in surprise as it
slammed open and there were three silhouettes all looking towards
him.</P><P><B>Narufan4ev: Well,
there you are.</B></P><P><B>Itachi: It's
short… why is it so short? Because it lacks… a good author…</B></P><P><B>Sasuke: Oh BURN!
(high-fives Itachi)</B></P><P><B>Naruto: Well, I
thought it was… wait I don't get this chapter what's going on?</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev: (sigh)
Yes, I know it's short but I had to do something today and well I
didn't have time to type so here you go! And I have something that
will make you feel better! I might (MIGHT) put…putinalemon!</B></P><P><B>Naruto: Wha?</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev: (blushes
deeply) I might put in a lemon… possibly…</B></P><P><B>Itachi & Sasuke:
Eeeeeeeeeee!! Yay! We're gonna have SMEX! (dancing around giddily)</B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev: I said
MIGHT! I don't know if could actually write one without dying of
blushing so much… well anyways give me 5 reviews and I shall give
you a chapter! Bye!</B></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 13</h3><hr><br><P><B>Narufan4ev:
Ok, this story is… goingonhiatus! (ducks under computer desk
avoiding sharp items being thrown) </B></P><P><B>Sasuke:
Yeah, they really couldn't tell by the fact that you haven't
updated in, what? 8 months? </B></P><P><B>Narufan4ev:
(breaks out crying) You all must absolutely HATE me by now! I'm so
sorry but I really need to revise this story or something because I
feel like it's going nowhere at all! And there are tons of spelling
errors, time issues, CHARACTER issues, and all that fun intimidating
stuff. And there's also </B><U><B>What Happens On the Bus, Stays on
the Bus</B></U><B> that needs to be written, and really could any of
you really say that this story is absolutely brilliant? And I'm
talking seriously here. I love the plot, really I do, but the story
itself is pissing me off and I can't let this go on any further!
I'm revising the entire story! I won't take it down but if you
have it alerted expect some new-old chapters coming out or something!
That's all I have to say and I'm really, really
reallyreallyreally REALLY sorry! (reads old chapter A/N) Wow, was I
really that bitchy…? </B></P>
