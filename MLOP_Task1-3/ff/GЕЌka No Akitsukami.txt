This is my first foray into writing fan-fiction. I'd like to give a shout-out to every one of the authors whose stories made it into my favorites, especially <b>.TheEleventhEspada</b> for being one of the first fanfic writers I've read, <b>brown phantom </b>for getting me into the Naruto Fandom, and <b>Legend of the Kyuubi </b>for posting this fiction challenge. All of you helped inspire me to finally write something of my own.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Please, review and criticize me. Let me know what you like about it and tell me what I do wrong, but don't flame. That's just useless, it doesn't state what you do wrong or how to improve, and you can't even roast a marsh-mellow over internet heat. So don't waste everybody's time.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Disclaimer: </b>I claim absolutely <b>NO </b>ownership of <b>Naruto</b> or any other manga/anime/franchises/products that may be mentioned within this fiction.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Gōka no Akitsukami, the Emperor of Hellfire</b></p><p style="text-align:center;">The night of October 10th was, for many people of the Elemental Nations, an ordinary night. Civilians stumbled into bed. Night-shift workers worked to earn their keep. And ninjas of all ranks carried out their missions…</p><p style="text-align:center;">"Hold the Line! The Hokage's on his way!"</p><p style="text-align:center;">…but for the ninja village of Konohagakure no Sato, it was a nightmare.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Uchiha Madara, the ancient head of the Sharingan-wielding clan of ninjas, thought to be dead, had arrived to the village, seeking revenge. When he was convinced that a peace treaty between his clan and the Senju clan, one of the few that could equally match their power, would lead to their enslavement, he tried to incite war. His battle-weary clan, which had been fighting the Senju for generations, spurned his ideas, calling him a war-mongerer and accepted the treaty, helping to found the shinobi village of the Leaf. Feeling betrayed and cursing his family for being "weak-willed cowards", the unstable Uchiha left the new village and swore revenge. Soon after he came back to challenge the Shodaime, or First Hokage, Senju Hashirama. And to ensure victory, he held the head of the strongest Biju clan, created by the Ten-Tailed demon Juubi before its defeat by the Sage of Six Paths, within his thrall: The Kyuubi no Youko, or Nine-Tailed Demon Fox.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Using the power of the Eternal Mangekyou Sharingan, obtainable only by stealing the eyes of your sibling, he managed to over-power the Kitsune's will and bend it to his whims, wielding it against the head of his rival clan. But even with the strongest of the Tailed Demons at his beck and call, Madara was defeated, thought to have perished. The unstable Uchiha managed to survive, severely weakened however, and bided his time throughout the years, waiting for another chance at revenge on his clan.</p><p style="text-align:center;">And soon that chance came, when the Jinchuriki of the Kyuubi, Uzumaki Kushina, gave birth.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Taking advantage of her weakened state, Madara killed her and released the Biju back into the world. He would've killed her son as well had the Yondaime Hokage not arrive, but by then the fox was already running rampant.</p><p style="text-align:center;">So now here the ancient shinobi was, watching the Kitsune he managed enslaved yet again rampage through the village. It was all he could do to keep from cackling as the fox used its tails as giant sledgehammers on the ninja. That is until the Yondaime arrived again.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">A large plume of smoke preceded the arrival of Gamabunta, the giant boss of the ninja toad summons. With skin the color of fire and a blue trench coat, the giant gave off the impression of a Yakuza boss, especially with the giant tanto and tobacco pipe he wielded, not to mention his mannerisms and accent. Upon his head were three individuals.</p><p style="text-align:center;">One of the people upon the toad's head was an aging giant of a man. With a long mane of white hair, a horned head-band with the kanji for "oil" engraved on it, red paint on his well-defined face, and an ensemble of red robes, sea-green vest and pants and wooden <i>geta </i>sandals, he reminded everyone of a flamboyant <i>kabuki</i> actor. This man was Jiraiya the Toad Sage, one of the <i>Densetsu no Sannin</i> or "Three Legendary Ninjas", named for surviving a battle against Hanzo the Salamander during the Third Shinobi War. Looking upon the destruction with a grimace, he turned towards his companions.</p><p style="text-align:center;">One of them was his teacher, Hiruzen Sarutobi. He was the retired Sandaime Hokage after his teachers Hashirama and his brother, the Nidaime Tobirama, passed from this world. Nick-named "The Professor" for his knowledge of the ninja arts, Jiraiya felt that the old man should have stayed back. With an aged face that sagged with wrinkles and a pointed beard of white, he was dressed in an all black suit that was reminiscent of samurai with it's armored plating. In his hands was a Bo staff, which was actually the summoned Monkey King Enma, transformed.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Between the two was Jiraiya's pupil, Namikaze Minato, the Yondaime. Given the name "Kiroi Senku" or "Yellow Flash" for his high-speed jutsu, he was a tall blonde man with eyes like an ocean. Dressed in a leaf-green jacket and pants with a matching flack vest and headband, he was covered in a white cloak that had blood-red flames stitched into the bottom end. In his arms was a bundle that kept squirming and sniffling. This bundle was actually Namikaze Naruto, the child borne to him and Uzumaki Kushina. With a forlorn look etched into his face, to addressed his fellow warriors. "well, this is it. It's been honored to know all of you."</p><p style="text-align:center;">"Damnit, Minato. Let us do this! We lived long enough lives, you're still young!"</p><p style="text-align:center;">"Surely there's a better way. Summoning the God of Death…"</p><p style="text-align:center;">Both Jiraiya and Hiruzen pleaded, respectively. Neither one wanted to see what was considered the greatest of the Hokage's so far waste his life. Alas, the blonde shook his head.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"Sorry, but I have to do this. I've found no other alternative to fight this thing, and how can I ask my people to do something I won't do? No, this is necessary." Minato replied.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"You're going to feed yourself to the fucking <i>Shinigami!</i> Just to seal this fox into your <i>own son!</i> Nobody should make that kind of sacrifice! What would Kushina say!" Jiraiya roared. He wasn't mad at his student, far from it. He was immensely proud of his attitude and sense of loyalty. He just didn't want to see such promise snuffed out, damnit!</p><p style="text-align:center;">At this Minato couldn't stop himself from shedding tears. Yet, he still managed to smile. "She would probably rip out every hair I have on my body and then castrate me for even considering it, calling me the biggest moron she's ever met while doing it." Trying to lighten the mood, he joked and laughed, though it sounded like he was in pain.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"<b>Heads up, tadpoles. The fur-coat spotted us!" </b>Gamabunta bellowed out a warning. Indeed, the "fur-coat" stopped using the Hokage Monument as a scratching post to glare at this new challenge. Minato looked right into it's eyes, seeing something wrong. Kushina said that whenever she communicated with the beast in her mindscape, its eyes were a mixture of amusement, contempt and pride, all wrapped around a shining glint of intelligence. So why did its eyes seem so… empty right now?</p><p style="text-align:center;">"We're running out of time. Tell everyone who's still fighting to retreat and evacuate the wounded. Do not leave anyone behind! Go!" Steeling his resolve, Minato barked out the commands, his voice leaving no argument. The two kage-level ninja before him gave the Yondaime one last look before leaving. One filled with regret and worry.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"Thanks for helping me with this, boss." the blonde addressed the boss summons, who looked up at the human with mournful eyes. Even one of the great summons of Konoha would miss this young man.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"<b>I wouldn't be much of a boss if I didn't help my subordinates, tadpole. Ma an' Pa'll miss ya, ya know." </b>He bellowed in reply before pointing his tanto at Kyuubi and charging, Minato starting to go through hand signs at a blinding pace after fastening Naruto to Gamabunta's head with seals.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">At the same time, Madara was gnashing his teeth in frustration. He completely forgot about this kind of situation! He has waited close to a century in order to exact vengeance, and he would be damned if he let some upstart youngster ruin it with seals! Focusing onto where he knew that blonde fool was, he warped onto the giant frog's head.</p><p style="text-align:center;">For all of their strength and powers, the Kages of the five strongest hidden villages are still human. And every human is prone to making mistakes. So it would be understandable that Minato, riding a giant toad that's trying to not be a demon god's lunch, the screams of the dying and wounded, and then having to avoid the blade of an insane man that just <i>phased into existence in front of him</i>, would mess up the sequence of hand signs for summoning the Shinigami. Though what he <i>did </i>summon absolutely shocked even Madara and Kyuubi into a stupor.</p><p style="text-align:center;">For when Minato activated the mismanaged jutsu to finish this fight, the ruins of the monument dedicated to previous Hokages spontaneously exploded into a shower of molten rock. Rising from the ashes and magma was a construct that scared everyone who gazed upon it. It was taller than the two giant creatures standing atop of one another. Made of obsidian and other volcanic rocks, it had the shape of two giant doors, held together by statues of decaying corpses. Carved into the rock were thousands upon thousands of various demons and human mutations, each one with an expression of either pain, insanity, satisfaction or ecstasy. As the construct started to bend outward, every one witnessing the spectacle found that it was a gate that led into a world of fire. A raging inferno engulfed everything that could be seen inside the gate. When the doors were fully opened, a voice older than the Elemental Nations sounded from everywhere and nowhere at once.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"<i><b>Foolish mortal, that who has summoned the </b></i><b>Gōkumon, </b><i><b>we have deemed you worthy. That which you wish to banish shall be."</b></i></p><p style="text-align:center;">With those words, giant chains made of rock, steel and bone launched out of the blaze, wrapping themselves around the demon fox, scorching it wherever it touched. Bellowing out in pain and rage, the Kyuubi lashed out at everything in range, before glaring at the Yondaime. Suddenly one of its tails lashed out and wrapped themselves around Naruto, ripping the wailing infant from the seals that held him to Gamabunta.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"This cannot be! I refuse to allow this!" Too shocked to even notice the world around him, Minato was too slow to prevent Madara from taking his head off. With his summoner's death, Gamabunta was dispelled back to Mt. Myobouku. Ripping off his mask to incinerate the fallen Hokage's corpse with Amaterasu, The insane Uchiha turned his gaze to Kyuubi. Focusing as much chakra as he could, Madara used his dead brother's eyes to try and send the Biju to an isolated dimension. The key word being <i>tried</i>.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"<i><b>Foolish mortal! Your interference has sealed your fate! Return to the void as you were meant to be!"</b></i></p><p style="text-align:center;">With growing horror, Madara found that his precious brother's eyes were useless. No, worse than useless. His chakra was being leached from his body out of his eyes much too fast for him to survive. And to his fury, the Kyuubi was still being dragged into the <b>Gōkumon</b>,its infant captive screaming for help. Focusing what was left of his chakra, the ancient shinobi forced his will to overcome the demonic chains before his head exploded. Both Kyuubi and Naruto, caught within the influx of conflicting powers, started to glow with an unholy brilliant light. With one final scream in a shockingly feminine voice, both the Kitsune and infant disappeared, the chains that held them falling to the ground. With a sudden crash, the <b>Gōkumon </b>closed and exploded with the force of a volcano, incinerating anything and everything within a five-mile radius.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">Within the evacuation center just outside of the blast radius, Jiraiya, Hiruzen and the survivors looked out into the destruction of what was once their home. With everyone of them in a shocked stupor, it was Jiraiya who broke the silence.</p><p style="text-align:center;">"Wha-… wha-… what was that?"</p><p style="text-align:center;">"I honestly have not a clue. And to be honest, I don't think I want one." was his only reply.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">Pain.</p><p style="text-align:center;">That was the first sensation that assaulted the Kyuubi's mind: a dull, aching throb that was permeating throughout her body. Accompanying that nauseating ache was a sense of foggy confusion. A slideshow of screams, flashing fire, toads and obsidian chains danced around behind her eyes. It took the nine-tailed vixen a few minutes to piece together what those images meant. When she did, she jumped up in belated shock. An action that resulted in a squeaking lump of <i>something</i> tumbling off her back.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Whipping around so fast that a few rocks were launched by the wind, the Kyuubi found a small, squiggling babe with a silky blonde mop of hair, sniffling and scrunching its face. Before the kitsune could do anything, the small baby let lose an ear-raping screech that caused her to flinch, badly.</p><p style="text-align:center;">This pissed off the nine-tailed fox to no end.</p><p style="text-align:center;">No, let's ignore the fact that she's a veritable goddess in power compared to the baby. Nevermind how she was bested by a mere human in her species' birthright, resulting in her being sealed into two different humans in a span of <i>fifty years.</i> Her freedom at the expense of her second jailor's life, who managed to worm her way into her heart, only to be enslaved by an illusion yet again and almost banished into <i>Hell?</i> Inconsequential! Right now she's nothing more than a target for this little <i>insect's </i>wailing voice!</p><p style="text-align:center;">Enraged by the small child's audacity to cry at her after all she's been through, the Kyuubi raised her paw and began to swing it down on the child when it opened its eyes. The moment those cerulean irises opened, she froze in shock. She knew of only one person that had eyes like that: an insufferably clueless blonde man with a heart of gold and the speed of lightning.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Lord Inari, this was the spawn of Minato and Kushina!</p><p style="text-align:center;">For a few seconds the fox was frozen in shock, mortified in how she almost killed Kushina's child. With a long, shaky breath, she lowered her paw to the ground, before guiding one of her tails to be dangled in front of the child, akin to a gesture of peace. Noticing the strange, fluffy appendage, the baby quieted down and started to reach towards the dangling tail. Unknown to both, her tail and his hands suffered a cut, releasing a small amount of their blood.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Thus, a bright, blinding flash of crimson engulfed them both as they made contact.</p><p style="text-align:center;">If the fox were to describe the pain, she would compare it to that of the searing chains that almost dragged her into Hell.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Yelping in shock and agony, the nine-tailed fox tumbled backwards into a large rock, scattering debris everywhere. Opening her eyes, she spotted her blonde companion, screaming in sheer agony. Before her eyes, the child started to change. A set of three parallel scars seared themselves onto both of his cheeks, giving off the impression of fox whiskers. His chubby little fingers and toes started to lengthen, the nails blackening and sharpened to resemble her claws. And his chest…</p><p style="text-align:center;">The nine-tailed vixen could see, hear and <i>feel</i> her chakra searing the kanji for "Red Eyes" onto the child's chest: <i>Akame.</i></p><p style="text-align:center;">The frigid, heart-wrenching god known as Despair wrapped its fingers around Akame's heart. This was the first time the fox witnessed such an event, yet she knew what this phenomenon entailed. Every bijuu's clan lore held a passage that described this event: two souls irrevocably connected to one another as a result of an awesome event, bound through blood, chakra and pain into a sacred pact. Anything and everything the two would experience held influence over the other, so much so that should one pass from this world, the other would soon follow.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Glancing down to her chest, Despair clenched her heart and shattered it completely. For on her chest was the kanji for "Maelstrom": <i>Naruto.</i></p><p style="text-align:center;">She was now, totally and irrevocably, <i>doomed.</i> Her life was forfeit. This weak, pathetic babe cannot survive in her world. He would be slaughtered, devoured by a random beast on a mere whim, taking her soul with him! All of her struggles, her triumphs, her power, crashing down around her because of a mere human <i>child!</i></p><p style="text-align:center;">Overcome with grief and despair, Akame lifted her head, preparing to voice her pain throughout the sky, when she caught sight of the horizon. The sun was halfway through its descent, bleeding into great, crimson swath on the skyline. That particular hue reminded her of a certain red-head: incredibly brash and hot-headed to the point of stupidity, stubborn enough to move a god-damned <i>mountain</i> from its base, with an indomitable spirit with enough charm and inspiration to warm her way into the fox's heart.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Kushina…</p><p style="text-align:center;">Taking pause to reminisce on her late friend, a strange fire sparked in her. That loveably brash idiot wouldn't let this problem bother her. Hell, she'd of probably charged right into the Shinigami's domain to tell him off for it. And the fact that it was with her son of all people…</p><p style="text-align:center;">Thus, Akame had made a decision. She would raise this child, nurturing him into a veritable god among humans, strong enough to survive, Hell, even <i>thrive </i>inside this harsh world. A warrior with enough drive and power to make a permanent mark in history.</p><p style="text-align:center;">It's what Kushina would've wanted.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Turning to the still-wailing Naruto, Akame grabbed him with her tails, nestling him into her abdomen and focused. Smelling something strange, Naruto acted on his instinct and started to nurse. Ignoring the rather unpleasant feeling, Akame really took in her surroundings for the first time. A sudden, barking laughter soon escaped her lungs.</p><p style="text-align:center;">Of all the places to end up in, it was here. The sight of her first sealing. The Valley of the End.</p><p style="text-align:center;">The irony was not lost on her.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p style="text-align:center;">Job hunting and college enrollment is absolutely brutal in terms of literary inspiration. Despite that, I am satisfied with this chapter. Whether or <b>you </b>are is a different story, however. You can't please everyone.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p>Welp, it's time for me to admit it.</p><p>I have absolutely no fucking drive to continue this fic.</p><p>It is very painful for me to realize this, as it is the first fiction I've ever attempted, and it had so much potential for me to work with. Which makes it all the more sad that my muse has completely shit on me regarding this story.</p><p>I'm going to have to abandon this fic.</p><p>Now, this does not mean that I'll give up entirely, oh no. I do have the inspiration for a new fic that came to me in a strange, but <i>awesome</i> dream. And as the scant few reviews I've gotten in <i>Violet Moon,</i> I apparently have a knack for writing porn. So you can look forward to that, at least.</p><p>Maybe someday I'll give this story challenge another go, but for now, consider it <b><i>dead</i></b>.</p>
