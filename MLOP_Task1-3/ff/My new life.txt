Well my life has just gotten a lot stranger. It actually started this morning when I did my usual routine of getting out of bed and getting ready for school, being a junior in high school is already hard enough without the constant sword training and shuriken throwing that I have to do every day after school "Damn my Sensei I've been training for six</p><p>years and he still won't take it easy on me" I said to my reflection in the bathroom mirror. I reached over and grapped my tooth brush and began to brush my teeth being extra careful brushing my larger than normal canine teeth after I had finished that part of the routine I went to my room to get my clothes "Let's see I've got sword practice again so I need my padded clothes today" I said pulling out my</p><p>soft padded black shirt and black pants that provided minimal protection against my sensei's powerful blows. I slipped the shirt on and pulled my long hair out and began to tie it in the traditional sword style, in my family I'm the oddball when it comes to hair, my hair has an unnatural color combination that even baffled doctors my hair took my mothers color of black but for some reason my hair had</p><p>taken another color with it, red and silver streaks had dominated certain areas of my hair mixing neatly with the black to give it a (in my parents opinion) unique look. I finished pulling my hair back and tied it looking in the mirror I laughed slightly at myself even tied up my hair still flowed down my back almost past my waist, looking at my clock I saw that I still had about thirty minutes left before my bus</p><p>arrived so I sat down with one of my favorite manga books Naruto. Just as I had finished the part where Naruto returns to the village after finding the seventh Pain and convincing him to trust Naruto with the future my alarm went off telling me that my bus would be arriving in exactly seven minutes, I grapped my backpack and wooden sword and ran to the door my parents were at work and wouldn't</p><p>be back until at least 9:00 p.m. so I knew I had to make supper again later but I would worry about that after I had gotten back from school and practice but what I hadn't expected was what was waiting for me on the other side of that door.</p><p><b>Nightmareblader: again sorry it's short but next will be longer promise.</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p><b>Nightmareblader: hey updated faster than Expected and as promised it's alittle longer and no flames please this is just how I write </b></p><p><b>Nighmaremistress: Hi I'm Nightmarebladers girlfriend I'm sorry that we haven't said their names yet but we want different names beside our original character names but we'll think of a way to get them in here soon promise</b></p><p><b>Nightmareblader: Don't own Naruto but that doesn't stop me from writing storys</b></p><p>Everything had been going fine this morning when I got up to go to school but what I saw when I went outside was definitely not what I had been expecting to see, my yard was gone the driveway gone tool shed gone even the flagpoles out front were gone and in their place were rows after rows of giant trees. I began to look around the surrounding area "This, this is definitely not where I</p><p>live" I said to myself as I walked around my house trying my best to figure out where I was and how I had gotten here where ever here was. Sudden movement to my left alerted me that I was not alone running into my house I grapped my very sharp samurai sword that my sensei had given me on the begining of my sixth year of sword training he had sharpened it to the point of grade A</p><p>sharpness he proved it to me when he cut thru a thick log of oak as if it were butter, I never knew why he had sharpened it but as I tied it's sheath around my waist I knew I couldn't complain about why he had anymore in fact I was a little happy that he had also sharpened my entire collection of swords but no matter how sharp he made the others he would always remind me on how sharp the</p><p>samurai sword was compared to the other weapons and then tell me to only use it if I seriously needed to. Grapping my ninja attire I quickly pulled it on and strapped on my 32 shuriken holster on my leg and the long and short swords that also were part of my outfit the long sword strapped to my back while the short sword strapped to the back of my waist so in one fluid motion both swords would</p><p>cross causing serious damage to whoever decided to charge at me, walking into the kitchen I slipped on my black mask which covered the lower part of my face which I had copied from master kakashi off of Naruto. Walking back to my door I carefully peered out to see if someone had come up to my porch but seeing no one I decided to do a little investigating. Pushing thru a thick brush I immediately</p><p>heard laughter coming directly from in front of me "Alright sounds like someone is having fun up ahead" I said to myself as I drew my short sword not knowing if it was friend or foe. Carefully looking around the tree that I was using as cover I saw a group of men standing around a girl that they had apparently been hitting and kicking because she was curled up in a ball all bruised up and bloody.</p><p>My temper began to rise at the sight before me but remembering the wise words of my sensei I slowed my breathing and silently slipped out from behind my tree and went for the first man quickly saying a quick prayer for forgiveness I dispatched him by slitting his throat, I let him drop softly and went for the next one then the next until I had killed each one leaving only me and the girl in front of</p><p>me. Bending down I brushed her red hair out of her face and was greeted with sudden whimpering as I tried to get her to look at me "It's ok I'm not going to hurt you I just want to help" I said, evidently my voice reassured her that I wouldn't hurt her because she slowly turned towards me and looked me in the eyes "W..will you not h..hurt me?" She stammered slowly rising up and also</p><p>showing that she had no clothes on what-so-ever. I felt my temperature go up and knew my face had to be going red, I removed my ninja shirt and gave it to her "Here cover up before we continue talking" I knew it was big enough to cover the majority of her body so I turned around to give her a minute luckily I had put on another shirt underneath the first so I wasn't naked from the waist up.</p><p>Looking at the downed enemie I decided to raid them for anything useful or at least a map that would tell me where I was when I suddenly heard her grunting in frustration and turned to find her putting the shirt on upside down. Sighing deeply I grapped the shirt and carefully pulled it off her and flipped it around closing my eyes so I wouldn't see her naked I directed her on how to put the</p><p>shirt on "Ok my eyes are closed so I can't see so listen to what I say first put your head and arms thru the big hole then put your arms thru the two small holes on the sides, ok now put your head thru the top" Feeling her hair brush against my chin I knew that she had finally gotten it on but what happened next was a complete shocker for me. Right as I was opening my eyes she was real close to</p><p>my face and began to kiss me.</p><p><b>Nightmareblader and Nightmaremistress: Read and Review</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p><b>Nightmareblader: New chapter</b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: Please enjoy</b></p><p>"She's kissing me! She's kissing me! Why is she kissing me?" I screamed in my head, after several seconds she pulled away from me and looked me in the eye "Wa..was that enough of a payment for this?" she asked me pulling slightly on the shirt I gave her. I couldn't answer, my lips were still tingling from her kiss but after a couple of seconds what she said finally made contact with my brain</p><p>"Payment? You thought that you had to pay me for the shirt?" I asked her a little surprised. She nodded a very deep blush beginning to show on her face "Isn't that what most men want if a woman can't pay for certain items?" I shook my head quickly "No! I wasn't going to make you pay for that shirt I have more back at my house" A sudden rumbling noise got my attention, I watched as the girl</p><p>grabbed her stomach and began to look like she was about to faint "Whoa there you're in no condition to be staying out here any longer come on I'll take you back to my house I can fix up your wounds and get you something nice to eat" I said holding out my hand for her to take. Cautiously she reached out and took my hand never taking her eyes off my swords, smiling softly I tried my best</p><p>to reassure her that nothing was going to happen "I promise I'm not going to do anything to you trust me" she took her eyes off my swords and back to my eyes giving me a slight nod she allowed me to pull her up and head back to my house, halve way home she collapsed and I had to carry her the rest of the way. Stepping up to my door I carefully opened it and twisted slightly so that I could get</p><p>in without bumping my arm or hitting her against anything, she looked around the room we were in which was the kitchen. It was a little dirty but it was easy to clean so I would do it later. Carrying her to the living room I set her down on the couch and turned to go get the first aid kit out of the bathroom closet, upon returning I found her looking at one of my sister's stuffed animals. I watched</p><p>her as she played with the small stuffed fox carefully brushing its tail like it was alive, I coughed to get her attention she looked up at me and gave me a small smile and laid the fox down on the ground. Walking over to her I knelt down removed my mask and lay my swords and shuriken pack behind me, I then opened the first aid kit pulling out the peroxide, bandages, and wrapping I set</p><p>them aside and began to examine her wounds, taking extra care not to hurt her anymore than what she had already been thru I poured a little bit of the peroxide into its lid and pulled out a cotton ball. Placing the cotton ball into the lid to soak I began to ask the girl questions while I placed Band-Aids on her not so serious cuts "So... what's your name?" I asked placing another Band-Aid on her</p><p>left arm and getting another one for her left cheek. She flinched suddenly making me think that I had accidently pulled a Band-Aid slightly off when I was smoothing it down; I looked up at her and saw she had a worried expriesion. Thinking that she didn't want me to know I smiled at her and said "It's okay you don't have to tell me if you don't want to" she looked at me rather surprised giving me a</p><p>good chance to really look her over. Her hair was a deep blood red color it reached past her shoulders and ended just at the middle of her back, her skin didn't have a single blemish in sight nor freckles, but it was her eyes, her eyes are what really got my attention they were a dark red like her hair but with a small hint of gray around the edges her pupils were not round instead they were</p><p>slits just like a foxes. "You have beautiful eyes" I said picking up the cotton ball and giving it a slight squeeze, she began to turn a little red from my compliment. Knowing how the peroxide was going to sting her when I wiped the cotton ball over her more serious cuts I held my hand out to her so she could squeeze it if the pain was too much for her to take. She looked at my hand then at me, I</p><p>gave her a reassuring smile hoping she would trust me. After what felt like hours she finally took my hand "Now this is going to hurt for only a little while but it will be over in a couple of seconds if it hurts to much then just squeeze my hand" I gave the cotton ball one more squeeze before placing it on the cut on her shoulder. She hissed loudly and began to thrash around until for some reason</p><p>she brought my hand to her mouth and bit hard. I grunted through the pain and continued to wash the wound, after several minutes of me washing and her biting she finally let go of my hand and turned her head away from me allowing me to start laying thick bandage pads on it I had noticed that it had started bleeding again after her little thrashing moment. She finally looked at me again and</p><p>stared at my arm blushing as blood flowed down it from the puncture wounds she had left on my hand, I patted her head and said "It's ok you didn't hurt me that bad" I grapped some bandage wrappings and rolled it around my hand, holding it up for her to see "See I'm fine nothing to worry about" but right then as I looked at her something wasn't right anymore something about her was</p><p>different. Looking her over I noticed features that looked like they fit her perfectly, now sprouting from her head was a pair of fox ears and six fox tails that curled around her body as if protecting her.</p><p><b>Nightmareblader: We've decided to use our original character names</b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: Couldn't think of anything for names so were sticking with original names</b></p><p><b>Nightmareblader: READ AND REVIEW</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p><b>Nightmareblader: This is actually an embarrassing chapter because I wrote little bit of this on how me and mistress met each other at a convention</b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: I was running around outside when I tripped and feel right on top of Nightmareblader, we were both dressed as Kitsune and decided to start a conversation on our favorite manga,anime,music,and cosplaying. After finally realizing that we had been talking for almost an two hours I suddenly realized how hungry I was I decided to go find a snack machine because I was low on cash</b></p><p><b>Nightmareblader: But I didn't let her I offered to take her somewhere to eat and guess what she wanted</b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: CHICKEN my favorite </b></p><p><b>Nightmareblader: So I took her to Kentucky fried chicken and ever since then we've been dating, writing, and making comics</b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: Enjoy this chapter along with this information</b></p><p>Needless to say I was stunned never had I seen something so beautiful as to what was sitting in front of me right now. "Your...you're a kitsune?" I asked still stunned by her beauty, she nodded slowly and tried to stand up but with a sudden growling noise from her stomach she fell back down completely drained of any energy left. Jumping up I quickly ran to the kitchen and</p><p>looked into the refrigerator and pulled out a bowl with some leftover chicken from last night, running back into the living room I gave her a fat leg and watched as she first smelled the chicken than devoured it cleaning the bone spotless. Looking up at me with hungry eyes I smiled and gave her the bowl it still had two thighs and a breast so I knew she would enjoy it heading back</p><p>into the kitchen I grabbed a cup and filled it with some tea, feeling the other items I knew it wouldn't be long before it got too warm inside and begin to spoil the food and drinks. Walking back into the living room I arrived just as she was cleaning the last bone off the chicken breast, I handed her the glass of tea which she slowly sipped it as I went back into the kitchen and</p><p>found a chair that I could use, sitting down beside her I watched as she finished the tea and relax on the couch. We sat like that for at least thirty minutes before she looked at me and said "Harumi" I turned to her confused "That's my name Harumi" "Oh, well that's a pretty name" I said scratching the back of my head. She looked at me for a while then</p><p>spoke "Are you going to tell me your name?" "Oh sorry I forgot to tell you its Koushi" I said sticking my bandaged hand out to her, instead of taking my hand she leaned up and kissed my cheek. When she pulled away I felt the place on my cheek it was still warm from her kiss "Wh..what was that for?" I asked her, she gave me a sly look and said "That's what a vixen always</p><p>gives her mate when she's happy" I nodded my head a little "Oh ok that make sen...MATE wait did you call me your mate?" I asked her picking myself off the ground; she giggled at me and grabbed my bandaged hand. Unwrapping it I expected to see blood stains but instead there was now a tattoo of a six tailed fox its tails reached up my arm and disappeared under my shirt</p><p>sleeve "When a kitsune finds someone they want to live the rest of their live with we mark them when our love for that person is high" I stared at the tattoo then turned to her "But we just met how could you love me so strongly?" She blushed and started to fidget a little "Well it's just...when you saved me like you did I knew you were someone who would defend me well. And</p><p>not only did you defend me but you took me to your home started to heal me and gave me your food, and from the way you treat me I know you must have a good heart and are willing to risk your life to defend people so any other vixen would of fallen in love with you like I did." I nodded my head slowly taking in everything she said "So let me get this straight you fell in love</p><p>with me because I not only saved you but also brought you to my home, was healing your wounds, gave you food to eat, and have qualities that you like?" she nodded showing me that I had reapeted everthing that she had said. I stood up and slowly walked into the hallway and leaned against the wall I needed to think about what I had just learned since technically this meant that</p><p>I was now in a way married to Harumi. Looking down the hall to my room where my weapons and clothes were I knew I needed to decide on how much clothes and weapons I was going to need before we leftfor a new place to stay since those people I killed probably had friends nearby, suddenly I felt Harumi's arms wrap around my waist turning towards her I saw she was a deep red.</p><p>Fearing that she may have developed a fever I felt her forehead "Are you ok you feel slightly hot" I said wondering if I should grab a cold rag or give her some medicine "mark me" she said turning her eyes to me, I looked down at her slightly surprised at what she had just told me to do "What?" I asked her she began to turn even redder "Remember what I said about you and me being mates?"</p><p>she asked I nodded rubbing my hand over the tattoo like mark I now had "Well I..I might of li..lied about it a..a little" she said, her temperature was starting to get worse "What do you mean I have the mark to prove that I'm your mate so what's wrong" I asked beginning to sweat a little from the heat she was giving off "Yes youhave my mark but I don't have yours and the longer I don't have it</p><p>the worse I will get" she said. Her temperature was getting worse I didn't know what to do I was beginning to panic "Why are you getting so sick?" I asked trying to get her to lean on me for support "W..we only mark if our love is returned if it's not then our bodies go into an extreme feeling of regret that couldkill us" I looked into her red eyes so scared and full of pain "Please tell me what to do" I</p><p>told her, she leaned against me and but her head on my shoulder and whispered "You have to mark me just bite my neck and I will be marked as yours" I nodded and bent my head over to bite when she interrupted me "But if you leave your mark on me then you and I will forever be mates"I'm guessing she must of expected me to pull away from her because she held on tight to my shirt, but</p><p>without a single thought I pulled back my lips to reveal my sharp canines and plunged them into her neck. I held for a couple of minutes and pulled back, she looked at me surprised and felt her neck. Just as the puncture wounds healed and her temperature returned to normala tattoo began to form on her neck it was smaller but reveled a fox with eight tails circling around her neck it's tails</p><p>meeting with it's face "Why does my mark have eight tails instead of six like yours?" I asked tracing the tails with my fingers. Still shocked about what I had done she didn't answer me right away then looking up at me she said "This might be a bit of a shocker for you but when I bit you your blood tasted like a kitsune's" directing her to my room I sat her down on the bed "But I'm a human my</p><p>parents are human how do I have kitsune blood?" I asked, looking around I found a picture of my parents and gave it to her to see. She looked the picture over and handed it back to me "You look nothing like them though" she said, I brushed my hand thru my hair "Well the only thing I see different about me and them is the fact that my hair is really long and is black,red, and silver" she stood</p><p>next to me and turned me to the mirror next to us "I still don't see any resemblance" she said. I stared at my reflection stunned, I was completely different from what I looked like this morning, My ears were now red and silver fox ears and eight black tails with silver stripes swung lazily behind me "Wha..what happened to me?" I asked her looking closer at my reflection to see that my sky blue eyes</p><p>were now a dark red color and were slited. "When you claimed me as your mate you must have drunk some of my blood which in turn awakened your true form" I still couldn't believe my eyes me a kitsune it was just too much too take in. I reached up and felt my new ears the fur was so soft I then reached behind me and pulled one of my tails around to me "Harumi you still never explained why</p><p>I have eight tails instead of six like you" she looked up from my sketch bookshe was looking through "Oh a kitsunes strength is based on how many tails they have" she stood upand turned around so that I could see her six tails. Suddenly my clock beside my bed went of startling Harumi and me, looking at it; it said 8:30 p.m. "Damn it's already 8:30, man time flies can't believe I forgot that it ran on</p><p>batteries tho" I had completely forgotten that my clock ran on batteries when the power goes out but right then I didn't think the power would be backon for a long time. I looked at Harumi and saw her still shaking a little from the alarm, smiling at her I pulled her towards me and hugged her. She let out a little squeak but slowly returned the hug "It's late how about I find something for us to eat</p><p>and we can go to bed" I turned to go to the kitchen but didn't notice the very deep blush that had appeared on her face after Ihad mentioned us going to bed together. Stepping into the kitchen I navigated myself around the large room and opened the refrigerator to try and find something for us to eat when I noticed a faint chill coming from it.</p><p><b>Nightmareblader: So another chapter done </b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: Read and Review</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><p><b>Nightmareblader: Nightmaremistress will be writing this chapter she wants to give it a try and may do it again if she gets good reviews</b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: There's going to be a lemon but be nice it's my first one, well it's also my first time writing on here so still please be nice</b></p><p>"Cold air? But that's impossible there isn't any electricity around here" I said to myself, standing back up I saw other appliances beginning to work again. The microwave dinged, the TV flicked on, and the ceiling fan in the kitchen began to spin again. Looking around still confused I suddenly remembered somthing "I was wondering when dad would finish that prototype</p><p>generator" I chuckled to myself, my dad loved to make things that used alternative fuel to make energy I remembered that he had attached a few solar panels to the roof of the house last week, he designed them to switch to the reserve power when there was no more light outside. Suddenly I was knocked down by Harumi as she ran into the kitchen and lounged at me</p><p>"Koushi what's going on why is it so bright in here all of a sudden?" she asked, I looked up at her and smiled "It's ok this is called electricity it powers my house" she looked at me calming down then suddenly blushed our faces were just mere centimeters away and my face was getting hotter so I knew I had to be blushing too. Slowly our faces came closer I could feel her</p><p>breath on my face, she closed her eyes and seemed to be waiting and I knew exactly what it was she was waiting for. Closesing the gap between us I felt her lips connect with mine, we lay on the floor for a couple of minutes kissing only stopping for a quick breath before continuing. Reaching up I ran my hand thru her hair scratching behind her ears making her moan in ecstacy,</p><p>she pulled out of our kiss and grapping my hand she placed it on her right breast I squeezed softly as she gasped with pleasure. She leaned back over me and we continued to kiss as she started to push my shirt up but as soon as my bare back touched the cold kitchen floor I began to shiver, she stopped and sat back up with a soft whimper as I started to get up but that</p><p>whimper quickly turned into a gasp of surprise as I picked her up bridal style and carried her to my king size bed. Laying her down I grabbed the bottom of the shirt I let her have and pulled it off her, her breast were small but I didn't care she was just too beautiful pushing her down softly I lay on top of her as we continued our tongue war. Breaking the kiss I slowly began to</p><p>make my way down her body to her sensitive area, arriving at my target I saw that she was already wet. I gave it a test lick listening to her moan louder before diving my tongue into her tasting her sweet juices as she began to buck her hips as if trying to get more of my tongue into her. Grabbing her hips I held her still as I continued my assault on her as she moaned out</p><p>my name, "Ah..Koushi Mmm...please I'm about to AH KOUSHI!" she suddenly screamend as her juices splashed on my face. I lapped up the sweet liguid as she rubbed her hands thru my hair tugging gently on the tips of my new ears, pulling myself back up to her face she was a deep red I smiled and pulled her closer to me listening to her soft breathing. Seconds later she turned</p><p>my face towards her and whispered "Please Koushi I..I want you inside me" Nodding my head I flipped us over so she was on top, slowly she pulled my pants down and threw them on the floor then began to pull down my boxers freeing my erect penis. Turning back to me she licked around the base causing me to jerk a couple of times, she then began to lick up and down it's</p><p>length before positioning herself above it. Grabbing it she directed the head into her warmth, slowly she decended allowing it to feel her up before hitting a barrier. Looking at her I asked "Your a virgin?" she nodded blushing "Yes so please be gentle" I smiled at her and reaching out I gripped her small hips and quickly but carefully thrusted into her. She let out a strangled cry</p><p>as I tore thru her hymen a little bit of blood dripping out of her flower, I waited intill the pain had subsided then with a nod from her began to move making her moan with pleasure as I thrusted in to her, after a couple of minutes I felt a low growl build inside my chest before looking at harumi and flipping her over making her gasp at the new position that we were in "Oh</p><p>yes...yes Koushi this feels so..so good ah oh kami I can't ah I can't hold it AHH" she cried out as she went thru her second orgasm her juices flowing down her legs and drenching my tool providing better lubrication. Taking advantage of this I speed up causing her to moan even louder, I leaned forward kissing her neck not slowing down even a little "Your so beautiful Harumi</p><p>I'm happy that you wanted me as a mate I promise to always look after you and keep you safe" I grunted slightly feeling my limit quickly approaching before pulling out of Haurmi and flipping her onto her back and thrusting into her again. I played with her breast taking the left into my mouth and sucking slightly before doing the same to the right her moans becoming short gasps</p><p>as I pleasured her breasts, my body reached it's limit and I shot my load into her causing her to cry out again, I slipped out of her as I lay beside her panting hard from our fun, we lay there for a while listening to the other breathing before we both drifted off to sleep with our arms wrapped around the other.</p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: So how was it? </b></p><p><b>Nightmareblader: To me it was just perfect </b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: thank you dear (Blows kiss to Nightmareblader)</b></p><p><b>Nightmareblader: (Blushing) Read and review</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><p><b>Nightmaremistress: Hey Nightmareblader is busy with another story right now so I'm writing this one</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>I squinted slightly at the morning sun as it pierced thru the open shades in my room, feeling a little groggy I sat up only to feel something heavy laying on top of me. Looking around I saw what it was that was keeping me from moving, Harumi had wrapped her arms around me and was using my chest as her pillow while each of her tails were interlocked with six of mine leaving the last two to wrap around us keeping us close to the other, I suddenly remebered what had happened last night and I meant what I had said to her I would never let anyone hurt her. Laying back down I wrapped my arm around her body giving her a slight squeeze she sighed in her sleep and snuggled closer to me a small smile on her lips, I listened to her breathing her</p><p>small body rising and falling with each breath. I was the luckiest guy in the world right then being the mate to someone so beautiful and unigue. My thoughts were suddenly broken when I heared someone coming down the hall, I reached beside my bed and pulled a shuriken out of a bag and readied myself to throw it. After a couple of seconds the intruder walked into the room and completly stunned me, because walking in with a tray of food and completly naked was Harumi. As I looked at the Harumi that had just walked in the Harumi next to me woke up, I felt her move and looked down at her "H...Harumi wh...why is there another you?" I asked as the other Harumi laid the food down on the bed near me. The Harumi beside me looked up</p><p>yawning "This is just my shadow clone I was too tired to get up and make breakfast so I created one" suddenly the Harumi standing beside the bed disappeared with a loud poof. I watched the smoke dissolve then came to a sudden realization "Shadow clones? Th..thats in Naruto's universe but...but how did I end up in his universe?" I asked myself as Harumi sat up and pulled the tray over to us. After breakfast I slipped on some shorts and began to search for something for Harumi to wear, we finally decided on a gray shirt that had the kanji for silent on it and a black pair of pants that had the kanji for fox going up it's left leg she insisted I stay in the room with her as she put the clothes on but first we had to remove the band-aids I found out</p><p>Kitsunes have extremly fast healing abilitys. When we had removed the last bandage she swayed her hips seductivly and gave me a little peck on the cheek then grabbed one of my tails and began to stroke it slowly which made my legs feel like jelly "Ah so your weak spot is your tails" she said grabbing another and stroking it, I quickly twisted around as she reached for another and began to tickle her, she fell back on the bed laughing as I continued to tickle her stomach and sides "I surrender" she said holding her hands up, I stopped and looked down at her blushing face smiling she looked at me then suddenly brought her face up to mine and licked my cheek. I blushed and suddenly found myself doing the same to her, she moaned as my tongue</p><p>went up her cheek and things might have gotten hotter if I hadn't remembered what we were doing "Later if we find a good place" I said sitting on the edge of my bed as she stood up with a whimper and began to put her clothes on. I later had a little bit of diffaculty with my clothes mostly because of the fact that I now had eight tails and had to find a way to get my pants on while providing as minamal damage as possible, but luckly Harumi provided an answer to my problem. I wagged my tails happily thru the small hole up near the waist of my pants as Harumi directed me on our disguises "Ok now all you have to do is visualise the body then supply the needed chakra" Said Harumi after I had tried several times to do a henge so that we could</p><p>disguise ourselves, it turns out we were close to Konaha it would only take an hour to get there at least according to the map I swiped off the dead bandits in the woods. After several minutes of practising I had finally done a perfect henge, nothing special all I did was make me look like my normal self nothing else Harumi did the same but did change her eye color to blue like mine. After we had finished packing up the needed supplys and weapons we decided that my house needed to go so Harumi performened a jutsu that I wasn't familiar with but effectively destroyed the entire house, as much as I didn't want to I knew that it had to be done the last thing I needed was someone finding it and taking stuff that could be used against people.</p><p>Walking thru the woods we came upon a road that I immediatly knew that would lead us to Konoha's front gates we took several breaks even tho we knew we didn't have to we just wanted to and talked to several people that we passed, one happened to be a weapons dealer and knowing that we would need money I offered him one of my old knife that had a hook at the tip and a very sharp blade. He handed me several bills and a few coins but judgeing from Harumi's shocked face it must of been alot of money so I let her keep a hold of it, the man attemted to buy some of my other weapons including my samurai sword but I guickly denied his rising offers and left before he tried to raise his offer any more. Around afternoon time we arrived at the</p><p>large gates but before walking up to the guards post we tried to make ourselfs look more ninja like, I pulled on my mask and placed my shin guards and arm guards on and tied my hair back while Harumi put on my extra mask and guards but also slipped on a pair of silver fingerless gloves that I gave her to complete her look. Looking at Harumi I smiled at her even in that outfit she still looked very cute I held out my hand to her to take which she gladly did and we walked up to the gates hand in hand. I saw the guards as they sat up in their chairs which meant they must of seen us, one was wearing glasses while the other had what looked like a long toothpick in his mouth that I knew was deadly because I saw him use it once in one of the manga</p><p>books I read, both were wearing the Konoha headband and Johnin vest "Who are you state your business" said the one with glasses as we walked up to them "My name is Koushi and this is my wife Harumi we wish to speak to the Hokage" the men looked at each other for a minute before the one with the toothpick stood up "Alright follow me and no funny business we have ninja all over the place and won't hesitate to kill you nor your wife" he said as he led us thru the gates. As we walked thru the village I couldn't help but feel the villagers staring at us, not that I could blame them I mean here were two people dressed in ninja attire clothes with no headbands while one is carrying a large blade on their back and a samurai sword on their waist</p><p>and the other has a long sword on their back and a short sword on their lower back. Nearing the Hokages tower a small girl bumbed into me and fell backwards I looked down at her as she looked up at me, I knelt down and saw tears at the corners of her eyes reaching into my shuriken pouch I pulled out a little stuffed white dog with black ears and a little pink tonge sticking out of it's mouth, I had picked it up along the road while we were taking a break from walking I was going to give it to Harumi but she had my sisters stuffed fox so I kept it never know when it would come in handy. The girl looked at the stuffed dog then at me "Go on you can have it" I said as I handed it to her, she took it and looked it over then began to giggle I smiled as I</p><p>helped her up and watched as she ran to a woman nearby who had been glaring at me I noticed she had a headband and some markings on her face telling me she was not only a ninja but part of Kibas clan who were known for their well trained ninja dogs. When the girl got to her the woman knelt down and looked the dog over before looking at me and smiling, I nodded then turned to Harumi who was watching me "Your good with kids" she said as we continued following our guide "Yea it comes from being a brother to two sisters" I told her as I took her hand again I didn't notice as she ran a hand over her stomach. "I have to concratulate you on what you did back there I was sure that Luna would of torn you apart if you made her daughter cry"</p><p>said our guide as we entered the tall building, after several floors we finally arrived at the Hokages office our guide knocked on the red door before we heared a grunt inside "Come in" said an old voice behind the door, our guide opened the door and allowed us to enter. As we entered we saw an old man who I knew was Sarutobi behind a desk that was covered with papers and documents he looked tired but was alert as we entered the room "You two are not from around here are you?" he asked as he blew out a puff of smoke from the pipe in his hand. "No sir we just arrived today" I said as me and Harumi removed our mask he motioned towards two chairs that were in front of his desk, as we sat down Sarutobi pushed a pile of papers out of the way</p><p>so he could see us "So what business do you have for me?" he asked putting his pipe back in his mouth. Me and Harumi exchanged glances before nodding "We wish to live here in Konohagure" I said as we grabbed the each others hand, Sarutobi raised an eyebrow at our reguest but he quickly lowered it and reached into a drawer on his desk "Guess I can't blame you we are a rather popular village" he said as he pulled out two papers and handed them to us with a pencil "All you have to do is write down your names and last names and what your good at judging by your responce it can help you attain a job here in our village" I looked over at Harumi as she wrote her name but stopped at the last name spot she looked up at me and I nodded</p><p>my head, during our traveling we had decided to use Kitsine as our last names but I didn't know if it would be a good idea to use it in a village that the Kyuupi no Kitsune had attacked. Thinking it wouldn't matter I nodded to Harumi and wrote Kitsine on the line, next was the age line I didn't know if age mattered or not so I just used my original age seventeen, the last line was for speacialty with my six years of training under my sensei I could easily be a teacher because sword training wasn't the only thing he taught me his teachings went from breathing techniges to the pressure points of the body how to make medicine from certain herbs fix broken bones without a sling and how to defeat opponets without inducing fatal injure's. I had</p><p>taught myself some of the jutsu's from Naruto thru a fan book that had several different kinds and tho I was slow I could still complete the full hand sign without error that came with three years of practice, and lastly was my shuriken throwing, in my sensei's eyes I had mastered it but I knew I still needed somemore practice. Looking back at the line and knowing what was best I wrote taijutsu,ninjutsu,and genjutsu teaching, sword training, shuriken throwing, medicine, medical, and body knowledge. Finishing the paper I looked at Harumi's and saw she had wrote the exact samething like mine but before I could ask why she had done it she handed Saratobi her paper than took mine and gave it to him to, he looked them over than nodded his</p><p>head "So you both studied the samething hmm well we could always use more teachers or people to train the genin, me and Harumi stood up and bowed "It would be our honor to help you lord third" said Harumi as we stood back up. Saratobi pulled out a stamper and stamped both our papers than reached into a cabnet behind him and pulled out a scroll and a key "This is for you, it's directions to your new home and also has your headbands and Johnin vest's sealed inside both of you will count as Johnin for now and get Johnin pay untill I give you your intsturctions" he said as he handed the scroll to me and the key to Harumi "So if thats all your dismissed" he said pulling a piece of paper off the largest stack and start reading it. Harumi</p><p>turned and opened the door but as we walked outside I thought of something and stuck my head back in "Excuss me lord third but why don't you use shadow clones for this job" I asked than closed the door, halfway down the hall I heared poofing noises of doppelgangers being made. Walking beside Harumi I took her hand again and asked "You wrote what I wrote so we wouldn't be separated didn't you?" her only answer was her kissing my cheeck and running out the door laughing, I sighed but smiled as I ran after her.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>Nightmaremistress: ok read and review please</b></p>

We woke up at 8:00 a.m. and began to explore the large house, it had everything that we would need a kitchen, living room, two bathrooms, a basement, guestroom, and a training dojo around back. After we finished exploring the house we went into the kitchen where Harumi made us a large breakfast of pancakes and eggs, after breakfast we slipped on our vest and put our headbands on our left legs before heading out into the</p><p>village. We stopped by several places getting some clothes here and there and grabbing some more ninja tools from a weapons shop. Later we went to a dango shop and ate lunch,and as we were just finishing I saw Anko walk in and order fifty dango's and a green tea, we left quickly when she started demanding a contest to see who could out eat her. Later I saw Shikamarus dad along with Ino's, and Choji's they were standing beside the gates of Konoha apparently getting ready for a mission, deciding to avoid any contact from the higher up ninja we decided to</p><p>head to the Hokages monument to relax for a little while before supper. Laying back on a bench we found at the top we allowed our invisible tails to wrap around us and hold us closer as we watched the clouds lazily float by, Harumi looked back at me and smiled "I told you no one would be able to see them" I smiled back wrapping my arms around her and resting my hands on her stomach which she quickly interlocked her fingers with mine "Ok ok I believe you I just didn't want to be walking through a village with our kitsune nature flashing about for all to see" our tails, ears,</p><p>and eyes were invisible to all who weren't either a kitsune, hanyo, or any other demon so we could walk through the village with no one noticing two demons in their village. Suddenly my stomach let out a loud rumble making Harumi laugh and me laugh as well, I closed my eyes and had an Idea "Hey lets stop by a ramen shop for supper" suddenly I felt her weight disappear and her hands slip from mine I opened my eyes to see her drooling "Heh I guess that's a yes?" I asked laughing at the way her face looked "Oh yes please Koushi, pretty please I haven't had ramen in so</p><p>long come on come on lets go hurry up" she said running towards the village. I sighed got up and ran after her untill I saw she was standing next to a fence her tails wagging in exitement I pulled out a map of Konoha and found Ichirakus ramen shop It was just down the road on the left "Ok Harumi let's go get some ramen" I said running down the road with her close to me. We arrived at Ichirakus just as the sun was starting to set konoha looked beautiful at night and I watched as the moon shone on Harumi's face, holding my hand out I smiled and asked "You coming in or</p><p>not?" Turning to me she gave me a broad grin before grabbing my hand and dragging me into the small restaurant."Welcome to Ichirakus ramen shop" Said an old man behind the counter of the restaurant, I looked around taking in the sight of the place in the manga it was actually smaller but now that I got a good look around I noticed that it had booths and small tables, my eyes immediately feel on a dirty mob of blond hair 'Naruto?' I asked myself he looked so young at least five and he so dirty his clothes were ripped and he had what looked like fresh bruises all over him</p><p>"What can I get you?" asked the old man looking at me and Harumi, I thought for a minute before I saw a girl walk out of the back room and walk over to Naruto "Here you go Naruto another bowl of ramen" she said as Naruto eagerly pulled it over to him "Thanks I just can't have enough of your ramen" he said as he began slurping his meal. I saw how much he enjoyed the ramen and decided maybe I should try some "I'll have whatever he's having" The old man nodded as Naruto turned around allowing me to see his face 'Jeez he does look like a five year old' I thought</p><p>to myself as the old man turned to Harumi "Ok and you miss" "Whatever my husband wants I want" he nodded and walked into the back room as I directed Harumi to Naruto's Table "Hey sport mind if we sit here?" I asked smiling at him, he carefully watched us before smiling back and nodding his head "Yea sure" As we sat down the old man came back with two large bowls of ramen smiling at us he went back into the backroom leaving us to talk to Naruto. After talking for almost an hour we found out that Naruto was actually four and that he was kicked out of</p><p>an orphanage for unknown reasons, I began to ponder about that, I had never heard of Naruto being in an orphanage in the Manga before but I also didn't know how his life was when he was four or younger he then began to tell us that the hokage had given him a place to live and some scrolls that would keep his food fresh, we told him some stuff about how we weren't citizens at first but became citizens yesterday and only certain personal stuff that was mostly it. After paying the bill I noticed that it didn't even make a dent in the money that me and Harumi made</p><p>selling that old knife I had, when we left we asked Naruto if he wanted us to walk him home, he denied several times but we eventualy confinced him to let us walk him home and I'm still glad that we did. With Naruto leading uswe made our way thru the now dark streets of konoha, me and Harumi talked with Naruto for a while before sudden movement behind us made us turn to see a large group of people almost all of them carrying some kind of blunt object or sharp knife. Immediatly me and Harumi pulled out our weapons and stood infront of Naruto, but the crowed broke</p><p>slightly and a very fat man walked forward holding a large butchers knife "Lower your weapons we're just here for that demon" he said pointing his meaty finger in our direction. Me and Harumi flinched slightly "Does he mean one of us" I whispered to her, she turned to me and shrugged her shoulders slightly "He's right there with the yellow hair he's the demon give him to us so that we can finish the fourth's work" yelled the man as Naruto looked around me. Suddenly I realized what the man was saying, Naruto was the container of the Kyuupi no kitsune and these people had</p><p>the intent to kill him thinking that he was the Kyuupi itself, pretending like I didn't know what he was talking about I asked "What do you mean demon he's no demon just a normal boy" I said motioning for Naruto to stand between me and Harumi, when he did I laid my hand on his shoulder as Harumi took his hand. The crowed let out a large gasp and began to murmur to each other before the man got there attention "Quiet they don't know about the Kyuupi but after I tell them they will gladly help us kill it" he said smiling evilly at Naruto. "4 years ago the Kyuubi no</p><p>kitsune attacked our village and our dear fourth Hokage defeated it but it didn't die instead it is now standing in that form between you and that woman and again we intend on finishing the fourths work so hand it over" he said smirking at Naruto who had a stonic look on his face, I watched as he squeezed Harumi's hand tighter then turned my gaze to Harumi who was looking at Naruto with love and affection that a mother would give their child turning back to the crowed I placed my heavy blade back in it's sheath on my back then pulled out my samurai sword, pointing it at the</p><p>fat man I growled softly allowing my protective nature to take over "No harm will come to this child so long as I'm around" I continued to growl at the man as a surprised look came over his face but was quickly replaced with fury at the fact that I wasn't going to give him Naruto "Did you not listen to what I said that is a demon not a child now give him to us or we will take him by fo.." I made a quick dash at the man cutting up words with my sword Instantly shattering the butcher knife he had and was already back beside Naruto before the pieces even hit the ground "<b>Call him </b></p><p><b>a demon one more time and you will not live to see the morning sun</b>" I growled louder allowing my eyes to turn into their kitsune form while my teeth got sharper and my voice got more demonic. The crowed began to slowly backup as my anger grew 'what is wrong with this village he's only four how dare they, this village has definitely lost my respect' "<b>You people are disgusting and to think I use to like the idea of living here</b>" I growled as Harumi stood next to me and Naruto held onto her leg, the fat man must of found courage before he pointed at me smirking "So your</p><p>being possessed by it, don't worry we'll deal with the demon and set yo..AAAHHHH" he screamed as I wiped the blood off my sword sending a small prayer to heaven to ask for forgiveness on what I had just done "<b>Possessed? Who said I was possessed this is my own will you worthless pig now rot where you have fallen and pray that Kami will forgive you for your sins tho I highly doubt he will</b>" I watched as the man feel over his guts falling out of his body as he continued to scream which was really getting on my nerves "<b>Just die already</b>" I growled as I</p><p>threw one of my new kunais at his head, I smirked as it impaled his head effectively silencing him "Ah much better" I said as my voice went back to normal. I glanced back at Harumi to see that she was holding Naruto who seemed to have fallen asleep, smiling I walked up to her and put an arm around her "Come on Harumi he's coming home with us tonight" I whispered so that I wouldn't wake Naruto. Harumi smiled as she laid her head on my shoulder "Ok Koushi" as we began to walk down the road I stopped and turned towards the crowed that were still stunned at what</p><p>had just happened "If I ever find out that any of you try to hurt Naruto again <b>then your fate will be far more horriple then what that pig suffered</b>" I growled as I turned back around and followed Harumi home.</p><p><b>Nightmareblader: (Laying in bed on stomach) Oh I don't (HIC) feel so good</b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: (Walks in with a bottle of ginger ale and some pills for stomach pains) I knew this was going to happen should of checked the box before I gave it to you</b></p><p><b>Nightmareblader: (Smiles weakly) Ah thanks Mistress what would I do without you?</b></p><p><b>Nightmaremistress: (Returns smile) Alright take your medicine and drink slowly (Watches to make sure all the drink is gone) Alright now scoot over </b></p><p><b>Harumi and Koushi: (slowly closes door)</b></p><p><b>Harumi: (Whispers) Another chapter done read and review</b></p><p><b>Koushi: Maybe Nightmare will be able to write tomorrow</b></p>
