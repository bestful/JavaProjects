into his toilet bowl, his hands clutching the slick slides of the
porcelain bowl as he spilled the contents of his stomach into the
clear water. When he'd finished he groaned and sat back on his
legs, moving his hands to wipe off his soiled lips and then clutch
his stomach as if that would help to stave off another episode. After
a few minutes, when he felt his stomach was steady enough to shift,
Naruto came slowly to his feet, having to lean against the countertop
of his sink.</P><P><I><B>Kit, I think you
should take it easy. </B></I>A rumbling voice
from deep inside Naruto spoke out, heard only by Naruto though it
seemed to echo off of the walls.</P><P>"Erm—" Naruto
groaned, "I'm fine, Kyuubi." He stepped forward and tumbled
into the half closed door of the bathroom, crushing his nose against
the wood. "Or, I'll be fine." He mumbled and stepped backwards.</P><P>Inside of Naruto, Kyuubi
grumbled but said nothing further, knowing from past experience that
it wouldn't do any good. Instead he settled down carefully, feeling
as if a sudden movement from him could upset the Kit's stomach
again, and despite popular belief, Kyuubi had no ill wishes towards
his Kit. In fact—</P><P>"Oh god," Naruto
groaned and then turned quickly to the sink and heaved a yellowed
stomach acid into the reflective basin.</P><P>Over the past month Naruto
had been vomiting up everything he ate and even things he hadn't
eaten. He'd been running a high fever and could hardly keep his
eyes open, he was so tired. He sweated like a pig in the night, even
when he opened his windows, lay naked on his sheets, and turned on
all of the two fans he owned. He knew he was sick, that much was
obvious. After the first week he'd visited all of Konoha's finest
doctors and they either turned him away immediately, or pronounced
that there was nothing wrong with him. Even Grandma Tsunade had told
him nothing was notably wrong with him, though she was curious as to
why he'd suddenly wanted a quick health exam. And because he hadn't
told her his reasons, she hadn't allowed him to go on missions for
three days, convinced he was ill. Which was Naruto's main
motivation for not telling anyone about his illness, though it was
pretty obvious that he wasn't in perfect health.</P><P><I><B>You're not
planning on going to training today, are you? </B></I>Kyuubi
rumbled in a tone that already knew the answer to his question.</P><P>Naruto said nothing nor
thought anything in return as he cupped his hands under the now
running water, sipping the liquid from his cupped palms he swished it
around in his mouth slowly, feeling weak as he spit it into the sink.
He made quick work of brushing his teeth, rinsing the sink of his
sickness, and then meandering into the front room of his apartment.</P><P><I><B>You're being
ridiculous, Kit. </B></I>Kyuubi rumbled. <I><B>You're
going to keel over if you keep this up. Someone as sick as you
shouldn't be training. Someone as sick as you shouldn't be doing
anything except lying in bed.</B></I></P><P>"Kyuubi, shut up."
Naruto mumbled as he pulled his black shirt over his head and blinked
slowly. "Oh god, did it just get really hot in here?" He gasped
as he pulled on his usual orange pants and slipped on his blue
sandals.</P><P>Inside of Naruto, Kyuubi
blinked curiously and hefted himself to his paws; he padded across
the expanse of the room he was allowed until his nose was poking
through the bars of his cage. He carefully thrust a paw out into the
depths of Naruto and then drew it back as quickly as he could,
pulling his searing paw to his tongue. Naruto was having one hell of
a hot flash.</P><P><I><B>Kit, you're
getting sicker</B></I><B>.</B></P><P>"Am not." Naruto
groaned and wiped sweat from his forehead, taking a deep breath as
the heat went just as quickly as it had come. "See? I'm better
all ready." He smiled and pulled his jacket on lazily, only barely
remembering to tie his head-band around his forehead as he headed out
the door.</P><P>Kyuubi growled as he
settled back down, scooting away from the bars of the cage. He wished
there was something more he could do to help the blonde. For the past
fourteen years, Kyuubi had been with Naruto; at times he was the only
one there for Naruto. Times like now, for instance. It was not hard
at all to see Naruto was sick, and yet, even though it had been a
month, none of his teammates or fellow villagers, even his sensei, no
one had noticed or said anything. No one had tried to help, or even
cared enough to make a passing comment of concern. These were the
times in which Kyuubi loved and hated Naruto the most.</P><P>And he did love Naruto.
He'd accepted that years ago. Everything about the boy was pure and
innocent and the opposite of Kyuubi. Opposites attract, right? But
what he both loved and hated about Naruto (as previously stated) was
the way the boy was able to love people who were cruel to him, the
way the boy was able to take the bad things and shove them aside
while keeping his faith, but he hated the way the boy was completely
okay with being an after-thought. He hated that Naruto was fine with
being brushed aside and unthought-of. He hated that Naruto stayed by
the sides of people who were never they for him.</P><P>"Hey, Sakura!" Naruto
chirped, his forced cheerfulness echoing in Kyuubi's ears.</P><P>The cotton candy haired
girl said nothing as she stared at Naruto with a careful eye. "Where
were you? Usually you're the first person here." She bit off and
Kyuubi and Naruto quickly gathered that the girl had had another
unfortunate run-in with Sasuke. "I was beginning to think that we'd
have to come drag you from your bed, knowing the lazy, immature loser
you are, I wouldn't have been surprised."</P><P>Kyuubi watched as Naruto's
memories of this morning flooded across his mind along with a quick
flash of resentment towards the girl. And then a rush of guilt at
such a feeling. The fox rolled his eyes and was tempted to let loose
a flood of unkind words at the pinkette, but since only Naruto would
hear him, it would do much more bad then good.</P><P>"I'm sorry, Sakura."
He said and forced a sheepish smile. "I had a bit of trouble this
morning." He confessed but didn't push his problems on the girl
like he should have.</P><P>Sakura rolled her eyes and
put her hands on her hips. "Yeah, I'm sure you had <I>loads
</I>of trouble. I mean, rolling out of bed at
whatever time you please, eating whatever you want, and having the
whole bathroom to yourself? Yeah, I'm sure that was just so
<I>difficult </I>for you."
She scoffed. "<I>I </I>had
to get up at a horribly early time, make breakfast for my whole
family, and then fight with the whole family just so I could take a
shower."</P><P><I><B>Which means she
slept in late, ate food her mother slaved over without saying thanks,
and then hogged the bathroom. </B></I>Kyuubi
translated for Naruto dispassionately.</P><P><I>Kyuubi, I don't feel
so good… </I>Naruto thought to his companion as
he apologized to Sakura and then moved clumsily to sit against a
tree, trying not to breathe to loudly while he clutched his side in
pain. <I>It really hurts.</I>
He thought and Kyuubi was positive that to an on-looker, Naruto
looked just like he always did, if not a little tired.</P><P><I><B>Just take it easy,
Kit. </B></I>Kyuubi said slowly. <I><B>You're
going to kill yourself if you keep using all this energy. </B></I></P><P>"Dobe." A flat,
uncaring voice greeted and Naruto looked up and managed a glare that
didn't even harbor half of the malice it usually did… at a
minimum. "Dobe?" The greeting turned to a question.</P><P>"Tch, Teme." Naruto
gasped out and Kyuubi felt Naruto's mask slipping away. Once more
he padded over to the bars and reached his palm out so he could feel
exactly what Naruto was feeling. The fox groaned and pulled back; his
poor Kit… in so much pain.</P><P>"Stop being so weird,
Dobe." Sasuke said flatly just as Kakashi arrived, late as usual.</P><P>Kyuubi listened to what
was going on and ground his teeth together in anger. Did no one see
how much pain Naruto was is? The way he was clutching his side and
squeezing his eyes shut? How could they miss the beads of sweat that
dotted his pale face? Why were they all so ready to take everything
he offered and give him nothing in return? Kyuubi growled.</P><P>"Naruto, will you stop
fooling around. I know you can do better than that." Kakashi said
flatly, without looking up from his book.</P><P>"Sorry, Kakashi-sensei."
Naruto panted and blinked tears of frustration from his eyes. This
was his usual training routine; he shouldn't feel like he was
dying.</P><P>Kyuubi could feel the
Kit's body weakening around him. He could feel his immune system
crashing and his chakra falling to bits. His stamina was dissipating
and his self-control and careful mask was being torn to shreds. The
fox blinked slowly as he thought quickly. If the boy was reduced to
nothing but a sack of useless blood cells, there would be nothing to
hold the Kyuubi back from escaping from his host. Right? The fourth
Hokage's seal was powerful, but when it came right down to it, it
was Naruto's chakra and will that held it in place most of the
time, even if it was only subconsciously.</P><P><I>Kyuubi, what was that?
</I>Naruto thought sluggishly, as though even
thinking took a toll on his energy. <I>Is that…
is that really true? </I></P><P><I><B>I think so, Kit. But
don't worry, I promise I won't go running around destroying
villages. You have my word. </B></I>He promised
without second thought, he already knew that if he was let out the
first thing he'd do would be to take care of his Kit.</P><P>Kyuubi felt Naruto nod.
<I>That's good, Kyuubi. Because I really don't
think I'm going to last much longer… </I></P><P>As he thought this, the
blonde came to his knees in the grassy clearing his team had gathered
in, where they were supposed to be listening to their lineup of
missions. Naruto clutched as his stomach as he heaved foreword, an
awful retching noise tearing from his throat as he puked up a
glistening steam of blood. He heaved again, and again, and his
teammates and teacher watched in stunned silence.</P><P>"Naruto. Is this some
kind of joke?" Sakura asked as Naruto clamped his hands over his
mouth to keep from retching a fifth times. It did nothing to help.</P><P>"Yeah…" Naruto
gasped out between an empty retch. "Just… just a joke. It's
just a joke." He said as the retches stopped and his eyelids slid
half shut as he sank to his bottom, wrapping his arms around his
shoulders as he waiting for the violent tremors that were sure to
begin soon.</P><P>"We should get him to a
hospital." Sasuke stated needlessly as he watched the blonde boy's
lips slowly turn blue. "Naruto, are you cold?" He demanded as he
got to his knees besides his friends who he'd claimed to care for
and touched his hand to the boy's forehead. "He can't have just
gotten sick. How long has this been going on for?"</P><P>Naruto opened his mouth to
brush off their concern, but his eyes rolled back into his head and
he fell like a sack of potatoes to the ground, his head making a
crude cracking noise against the hard soil. When his eyelids were
next peeled open, it was to reveal animalistic red eyes.</P><P>"A little more than a
month." A nightmare-ish voice ground out from behind Naruto's
lips. "And not one of you bastards cared enough to notice. Are you
happy now? I swear to Kami, if my Kit dies I'm going to rip out
your throats and feed them to you."</P><P>Kakashi's one single
grey eyes flashed carefully as none other than the Kyuubi addressed
him. "We would have noticed." He said flatly.</P><P>"Oh, really? So you've
simply been letting Naruto suffer all this time?" Kyuubi snapped.
"No. Not a damn one of you people, the people who matter to him,
cared about him enough to notice. Do you know what his morning
routine has consisted of lately? He wakes up, pukes his guts out,
runs out here only to get an earful from that pink haired bitch, and
then has to waste energy on the two of you, just to keep up
appearances," Kyuubi's eyes glared at the trio of stony faced
ninja, "and then he has to shovel ramen into his throat, puke that
up, and then he goes home, goes to bed wear he nearly sweats to death
and then wakes up to do it all over again. Not to mention all the
stupid things he does to make your lives more comfortable in
between." Kyuubi sniffed angrily. "And they call me a monster."</P><P>"It's not our fault.
Why didn't he tell us?" Sakura snapped, angry at being singled
out.</P><P>Naruto's body snapped up
and his hand made harsh contact with Sakura's cheek. "He didn't
want to worry you." The Kyuubi spat out. "But not to worry, Kit's
not going to be so neglected for long. If he gets any worse, and he's
going to, I'll be let out. And then I'll be there to care for
him. And I'll be there to make your lives a living hell."</P><P>Kakashi's eye snapped
open. "You'll be let out?"</P><P>"Yes, I will. But I
promised my Kit I wouldn't wreak any havoc, and I'll keep my
word." Kyuubi said slowly and blinked. "But you had better get
him to a hospital, because when I'm let out, it's going to hurt
like a bitch."</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p align='center'>Chapter Two</P><P>The
connection Kyuubi and Naruto shared was difficult to explain, the way
it felt as well as the way it worked. When Kyuubi was inside of
Naruto, hidden deep in the small corner he was provided with, it was
like they were two separate beings. But at anytime he pleased, Kyuubi
could simply stick any one of his appendages through the cage bars
and have an intimate peak at exactly what his Host was feeling. This
was how he had come to love Naruto, from the small looks into the
depths of the boy's thoughts. He supposed some people might see
that as an invasion of privacy, but how about we stick them in the
belly of a young boy for a number of years and see if they don't
become desperate for any sort of entertainment?</P><P>The
way it worked was pretty vague, even to the main components involved,
over the years both Naruto as well as Kyuubi had been shocked or
surprised by some hidden ailment or plus to their unique situation.
The gist was this: a seal put in place by the Forth Hokage kept
Kyuubi inside of Naruto. But, of course, it eventually got a little
more complicated than that. The first complication was the mental
connection between Kyuubi and Naruto; the fact that they could speak
to one another freely. The second surprise was Kyuubi's ability to
'feel' Naruto. The third was Kyuubi's chakra leak into Naruto's
own, and neither were complaining about that. And now, apparently,
Naruto's illness was about to unleash the Demon Lord… possibly
for good.</P><P><I>Kyuubi…</I>
Naruto thought in a small voice, the first time anyone had heard from
his in hours. <I>Kyuubi,
are you up there?</I></P><P>"What
is it, Kit? I'm busy." The fox said in a flat voice, a voice much
more <I>boyish </I>than
usual.</P><P><I>Kyuubi,
you didn't. </I>Naruto
groaned and tried to force himself into consciousness, only to run
into a mental wall and have his mind pushed back. <I>Gimme
back control of my body</I>.
Naruto whined and Kyuubi could feel the boy pacing around in the
small cage.</P><P>"Will
you shut up, boy, the grown-ups are speaking." Kyuubi snapped from
the outside.</P><P>"Um…"
Sakura made a small noise as she watched Naruto (who she'd been
told actually wasn't Naruto…) "what's going on, Kakashi?"</P><P>Ignoring
the girl's inquiry, the buxom Tsunade sagged into her chair.
"Kyuubi, is Naruto conscious?"</P><P>Kyuubi
nodded, making Naruto's blonde locks bob against his face. "The
boy ought to cut his hair," he said aloud as he brushed an unruly
lock behind his ear. "It makes you look like a shaggy, mangy dog."
He said to the boy inside of him before he turned to meet Tsunade's
concerned eyes. "And yes, he's awake."</P><P>His
answer was met with silence and he didn't push the matter as he
pulled Naruto's long, skinny legs underneath him and curled up on
the couch, finding himself growing tired of the human's charades.
He had explained calmly his history with Naruto; he'd been
conversing civilly with the boy since before the boy had the ability
to converse, meaning Naruto had always known he was there. Both
Tsunade and Kakashi looked more than a little horrified at that. And
Kyuubi continued to explain how they'd come to discoverer the rest
of their abilities and disabilities when it came to one another. And
finally he told how he would most definitely be let out of the boy,
only to take care of him and give his 'important people' a piece
of his mind.</P><P>"Back
in the clearing," the dark-haired boy Kyuubi knew to be called
Sasuke began, "Back in the clearing you said that when you were…
let out," he raised his eyes as if inquiring if this was the proper
term for it, "that it would hurt Naruto."</P><P>Kyuubi
turned to the boy; of all Naruto's friends, the Uchiha both pissed
Kyuubi off the most, and managed to remain his favorite at the same
time. He cocked a blonde eyebrow in the raven haired boy's
direction.</P><P>"Yeah,
I remember saying that." He said and shed the hideous orange jacket
he wore, finding himself suddenly hot.</P><P>"Well…
is there any way we could make that hurt less? I… I confess that I
didn't notice Naruto was sick…" he looked down guiltily, "but
he's still… still one of the most important people in my life,
and if I can stop his hurting; I will."</P><P>Blonde
eyebrows scrunched together and Kyuubi watched as his vision blurred.
"That's very sweet," he said slowly, his gravelly voice hitting
a high pitch, "but there's not really anything we can do." He
looked slowly around the room, feeling sweat rolling down his
forehead as he tried to locate a trash bin. "Oh my god…" he
mumbled and then made a dash to the nearest window, threw it open,
and spilled the contents of Kit's stomach out onto the street
below.</P><P>"Did
the Kyuubi say how long Naruto's been sick for?" Tsunade asked
gravely as she watched Naruto's body heave violently, nearly
propelled out the window by the motion.</P><P>Kakashi
nodded slowly, his eyes wide. "He said a month."</P><P>Tsunade
brought a hand to her forehead and sighed, "Could you give us the
specifics of Naruto's illness?" Tsunade asked slowly of the fox,
who was currently unable to reply.</P><P>"He
said that Naruto has night-sweats, vomiting… severe vomiting. From
the way he's been acting I'd also say; dizzy spells, exhaustion,
and he was puking up blood about an hour ago." Sasuke supplied.
"But Naruto wouldn't admit to being sick, because it might've
worried us…"</P><P>"Well,
yes, but apparently the Kyuubi is affected by the illness when it's
in control, and I'm sure it'll have no problem relaying all of
its aches and pains." Kakashi announced.</P><P>'<I>It'?</I>
Naruto's voice echoed through Kyuubi's head. <I>Why's
he called you 'It'?</I></P><P>"Don't
worry about it, Kit. To them I'm a monster." Kyuubi said softly
as he wiped off Naruto's lips. "Tsunade, the boy's also got a
killer pain in his…" he paused. "Left side. It feels like a
knife, and he sometimes passes out…" He groaned and then flopped
back onto the couch. "I can't take much more of this…" he
mumbled as his red eyes drifted shut.</P><P>Sasuke
watched as his best friend's body shuddered as the two entities
traded places, and then his breathing evened out into a shuddered,
wheezing gasp. He moved forward and felt the blonde's forehead with
the back of his hand, god, he felt so terrible about not noticing. He
sighed and then scooped the skinny boy up and headed out the door,
with all the other people that had failed Naruto on his heels.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P><I>Kyuubi,
I don't think I wanna wake up… </I>Naruto
said slowly as he grasped the bars from the outside of the cage. <I>It
hurts out there…</I></P><P><I><B>Kit.
</B></I>Kyuubi rumbled as
he approached the bars. <I><B>It's
going to get bad enough that it'll hurt in here, too. But I won't
make you wake up; I'd be lying if I said I didn't want you here</B></I>.</P><P>Naruto
smiled at the large fox and then sank to his knees in front of the
cage, lacing his arms through the bars and holding his hands
together. <I>It's been
awhile since we've talked… face to face. Kyuubi, is that what
you've always looked like? </I>Naruto
inquired curiously, having a vague memory of a tan skinned man with
thick locks of red hair.</P><P><I><B>No.
I don't remember when I became this way… it was a long time ago.
</B></I>He said
thoughtfully and watched the blonde from the corner of his eye. <I><B>I
think I'm going to change into my human shell before I'm
released. It'll be easier to care for you then.</B></I></P><P><I>Thank
you, Kyuubi. </I>Naruto
thought sweetly, his mind brushing gently against Kyuubi's.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>"He
seems fine." The elderly man in a white jacket insisted. "We've
run all of these tests twice already, Lady Hokage. If you want me to
run another battery, I suppose we have no choice. But I must advice
against—"</P><P>"Do
it." Tsunade ordered. "There is something wrong with this boy, I
tell you."</P><P>The
man narrowed his eyes at her and then turned and paced away,
grumbling under his breath in between his barking orders that sent
the hospital staff scurrying.</P><P>"Lady
Hokage, is he going to be alright?" Sakura inquired gently of the
blonde boy who lay straight as a stick, his chest rising and falling
and forcing out painful noises. "He doesn't seem so good." She
whispered and her fingers skimmed along the edge of his
sticky-with-sweat brow.</P><P>"Did
you gather that before or after he began vomiting blood everywhere?"
Sasuke snapped from the open window, where he was sitting and
watching Naruto carefully. "Of course he'll be okay," Sasuke
said after a quick moment, "Dobe always pulls through." He said
firmly.</P><P>Tsunade
turned to look at the Uchiha and wondered if the boy could stand to
lose another person. Especially now that the person he might lose was
the only person who had reciprocated Sasuke's affections and still
hadn't put up with his Uchiha ways. Tsunade's eyebrows closed
together, though Sasuke tried to hide the fact, he truly did love
Naruto. Be it like a brother, a close friend, or something more, it
wasn't Tsunade's business, but none-the-less…</P><P>"You
don't know that, Sasuke." Sakura said suddenly, her hands in her
hair. "Naruto's not superman, this might just be it for him. I
mean… think of all the odds he's beaten… maybe this one is the
one that'll—"</P><P>"Haruno,
it is not below me to strike a woman." Sasuke warned with a flash
in his onyx eyes.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P><I>Can't
you hear them bickering? </I>Naruto
sighed to Kyuubi, who was stretched out in front of the boy, enjoying
the feel of the human's hands in his fur. <I>Who
would want to wake up to that? Don't they know I can hear them? </I></P><P><I><B>Kit,
I'm sure it's just that they're stressed. You know they're
all very worried about you.</B></I></P><P>Naruto
narrowed his eyes, <I>Yeah,
I know. And whose fault would that be, Kyuubi? You shouldn't have
done that. I could've just passed it off as some bad ramen and been
fine. I've been getting better these past few days, anyway. </I></P><P>Kyuubi's
fur bristled under Naruto's touch and the blonde drew back a
fraction of an inch. <I><B>Boy,
you have been getting worse these past couple of days. I don't know
what wrong with you, but there is something wrong. </B></I></P><p align='center'>**</P><P>"The
tests are negative. All of them." The same elderly doctor from
before informed Tsunade with a sniff, his thin arms folded over his
unimpressive chest. "Again." He added in a I-told-you-so tone.</P><P>Tsunade
turned and looked at him and briefly toyed with the idea of hitting
him, that is, until Sakura beat her to it. The young girl hurled a
small metal pan in the doctor's direction with the force of a
tornado. Her eyes gleamed as she opened her mouth and let loose a
torrent of very un-ladylike words and phrases.</P><P>"And
another thing!" Sakura boomed. "How dare you mock Lady Hokage, if
she says there is something wrong with a patient, who are you to
doubt that? Are you forgetting her <I>years
and years </I>of
experience or maybe her <I>incredibly
in-depth and rigorous </I>training?!
And besides, have you even seen your patient?! Take one look at this
boy and tell me he's not sick!!" She managed this all in a single
breath and by the time she had finished her face was red and her eyes
were moist. "And then fix him." She breathed and turned back to
Naruto, her hand reaching out to grasp his own.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P><I><B>Oh,
the bitch does care. </B></I>Kyuubi
snapped and gnashed his teeth together. <I><B>Anyway,
Kit, don't you think you should be getting back now? From the
sounds of everything, more than one person is about to develop a
hernia inspired by you.</B></I></P><P>Naruto
looked up from where he lay on the floor. <I>I
feel terrible, Kyuubi</I>.
He breathed and then sighed. <I>I'm
going to go tell them all goodbye, just in case. </I>Naruto
stood up slowly. <I>Oh,
and Kyuubi? When you are released… if I do die, will you please
take care of Konoha? I always wanted to but if things don't turn
out…</I></P><P><I><B>Shut
up, Kit.</B></I> Kyuubi
said and Naruto gave him a winning smile before walking through an
unnoticeable door.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>When
Naruto woke up, there was a quick, loud rejoicing. And then there
were questions from the doctors and from his teammates, and from the
Hokage and his friends. There were accusations and people shoving
flowers in his face, with balloons and every animal in the jungle,
stuffed and complete with a bow. He took it in careful strides,
though, and managed to hold down his vomit, that is, until TenTen
shoved a box of chocolates under his nose and declared they would
cure anything.</P><P>"Oh."
Hinata said as she patted Naruto's back in a motherly fashion and
wrinkled her nose.</P><P>"You
really are sick." Kiba commented in disgust as he checked his shoes
and held Akumaru away from the puddle of sick.</P><P>Naruto
gave his friend a dirty look and curled up into a ball on his side.
"I think you guys should leave. I'm not feeling so well." He
admitted briefly. "And I don't know if it's been explained to
you yet… but once I get sick enough, Kyuubi's going to be
released. And that'll probably be within the hour, so you might
want to… leave… now."</P><P>It
went quiet for a moment and Naruto sighed, rolling over on his other
side so that he didn't have to watch them staring at him. He heard
the whispery voice of Sasuke and Sakura, ushering the group out the
door and telling them to go to Kakashi, that he would explain. She
told them that they shouldn't spread this around the village; it
could mean bad things for Naruto. And then it went quiet again, save
for the gently closing of the door, and the caught breathing for
Sasuke and Tsunade.</P><P>"Hn,
Dobe." Sasuke said flatly and Naruto felt the weight of his friend
weighing down on the corner of the bed. "What the hell were you
thinking?" He finally asked his voice still low.</P><P>Naruto
shrugged, which was quite the feat in his present position, "I
didn't want to worry you guys, I mean, you have enough to worry
about; what will finding your brother and all that. And Sakura has
her whole family to run after, and Kakashi already had enough
responsibilities. So I just figured… I guess I just figured that
I'd get better."</P><P>Sasuke
gave another grunt. "Did you even see a doctor, Dobe? How did you
expect to just get better?" He snapped.</P><P>Naruto
turned his shoulders so he could crane his neck to glare at Sasuke.
"Of course I went to the doctors! I saw all of them who'd see me,
and even some who wouldn't. I even tricked Grandma Tsunade into
giving me an exam. None of them saw anything wrong with me." He
grumbled and rolled back over, his face hidden in his hospital-issued
pillow. "I'm not dumb, Teme." He mumbled into the pillow,
drawing the blankets around his shoulders.</P><P>Sasuke
snorted. "Not dumb? If you weren't dumb, you would've come to
me with your problems."</P><P>Naruto
said nothing; instead he let out a painful groan and clutched at his
stomach, cursing the pain under his breath. His side felt like he was
being branded, the searing pain radiated outward and he groaned
again. After a few moments, when the pain had usually gone away, it
was still there, strong and forceful. Naruto bit down on his lip in
effort to remain quiet and Sasuke watched as his best friend suffered
in silence. He was a little surprised at how much it bothered him,
after all, he supposed the Dobe had been suffered in silence his
whole life. Why should now be anymore awful to watch?</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>Hours
later, Naruto had finally drifted off into a drug-induced sleep.
Tsunade had called for pain-killers after the first half hour of
pain, unable to watch Naruto writhe any longer. It was well into the
night hours, by now, since Naruto's illness had become known in the
late afternoon, and they'd spent a long amount of time berating
themselves in her office, and then there was the time in which Naruto
slept. All in all, the events of that day had moved rather quickly.
Tsunade was glad things had finally settled down.</P><P>Naruto
lay sleeping; sweating, groaning, and still clutching at his sides,
but at least it wasn't the chocked back screaming he'd been
unable to contain early. Sasuke was asleep at his side, his dark hair
stark against the sterile white of the hospital sheets, the Uchiha's
hand gripped the bed sheets tightly and he mumbled in his sleep.
Sakura had gone home hours ago, just after she'd pushed the other
Hidden Leaf Village Nin. from the room. Kakashi, Tsunade knew, was in
the company of Iruka and Jirriya, the three were searching for a way
to cure Naruto as well as keep the Kyuubi locked inside of him.
Tsunade personally couldn't care less about the latter expedition;
she though the demon lord seemed nice enough, and he'd obviously
cared for Naruto. That made him a fine character in her book.</P><P>Glancing
up from her sheet of papers she yelped in surprise when she found
Naruto's eyes wide open and the pupils small as needle points. She
moved over to his side and pushed Sasuke, who was only now rousing
from his slumber, out of her way as she performed a series of
hand-seals and focused her chakra at Naruto, whose chest was
contracting visibly. She watched in terror as the blonde boy (who'd
she had grown to care for) clawed at his bed sheets in silent,
unbearable pain.</P><P>"What
the hell?" The Uchiha gasped out as he stumbled backwards, his eyes
locked on Naruto. "Is it… is it the Kyuubi?" He asked
breathlessly as Naruto began to tear at his own skin.</P><P>Tsunade
didn't bother to reply, she simply pressed the Call Button for a
team of nurses and tackled Naruto to the sheets, trying to keep him
from tearing his own skin to badly before they arrived with proper
restraints. Sasuke watched as his best friend screamed loudly and bit
at his lips, trying to find an outlet for the pain he was feeling.
When the team of nurses had filled in, Tsunade had already received a
long, thin scratch just above her eye, and two angry red hand-prints
on her forearms. She stepped back and watched as Naruto's eyes
pleaded with the heavens to simply make it stop.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Author's
Note: Wow, I just want to thank you guys for all the positive
feedback I received in just a few hours. I really appreciate it and
so I'll try to keep this story rolling, it's a little lighter to
write than my 'Anemone' fanfiction, so I enjoy it more.</P><p align='center'>Chapter Three</P><P>Naruto's
pain had taken on an appearance, at least to Kyuubi. The fox lay
there on the cold floor, his eyes squeezed shut tight and his ears
flattened against his head in vain effort to keep his Kit's screams
from his consciousness. It had begun what felt like years ago, and
simply never stopped. The blonde's pain was radiating even into
Kyuubi's little corner, where it brushed against the demon lord's
fur and caressed his mind, making him snap his jaws in pain and
frustration.</P><P>He
groaned when a new wave washed through the bars of the cage, crashing
against him almost audibly. He allowed himself a grunt and then
pushed the pain away along with Naruto's refreshed shouts. Kyuubi
couldn't help but feel it was all his fault, he knew that it was
only because the seal was being forcibly torn from the boy that he
was experiencing so much pain, and Kyuubi felt that it was too high a
price to ask for his freedom. He wondered vaguely if Naruto would
hate him, when he was released, if his Kit might look into his eyes
and then look away, Kyuubi wasn't sure if he could bare that.</P><P>Not
only that, but it was killing him not knowing if this pain would go
on, even after he was released. He hadn't experienced Naruto's
discomforting illness for long, but those few hours were enough to
open his eyes to the fact that Naruto had managed to hide the bulk of
it, even from Kyuubi. This made the fox wonder exactly what sort of
ailment was killing his Kit. Because, all in all, if this kept up,
Naruto would die. A sickness that was more on the inside then on the
outside, which was saying something considering the outside symptoms
include turning your stomach inside out and making you sweat like a
raincloud while you sleep. The fox growled and his fur bristled as
he once again closed his eyes, reviewing all the illnesses he'd
even encountered patiently. Well, as patiently as he could be
expected to.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>Iruka
leaned heavily against the door, he wasn't sure if anyone else had
managed to keep count, but this was Day Three of Naruto's
suffering. He was beginning to wonder if a Mercy Killing might not be
called for, and it wasn't sarcastic. Listening to the young Ninja
scream and then watching him try to tear at himself, well, it was
terrible to say the least. Especially when Iruka secretly imagined
himself to be the boy's father figure.</P><P><I>Some
father… didn't even notice he was sick.</I>
Iruka thought pityingly. <I>And
now look at him… </I>his
mind whispered as he peered through the thin glass window, behind
which Naruto was only barely held by chakra enforced straps and
everything else they could find to keep the boy from injuring
himself. <I>This is all my
fault.</I></P><P>"Iruka,
Kakashi." Someone breathed in a sigh of relief. Iruka was tugged
away from his thoughts as he looked up at Tsunade, her hair was a
mess, unbound from her usual ponytail and her make-up was rubbed
under and over her eyes; she looked like hell. "Oh, thank god,
please tell me you found out what's wrong with Naruto?"</P><P>Kakashi
stepped forward and Iruka silently thanked the grey haired man, he
wasn't especially fond of Naruto's teacher, mainly because he
knew the man liked both Sakura and Sasuke over the blonde, but also
because Kakashi spent near as much time with Naruto as anyone else,
he was supposed to be watching the boy with a careful eye, and yet
the man didn't even have a way to fix Naruto. But despite that,
Iruka was in no shape to speak with anyone, so it was better if
Kakashi handled it.</P><P>"There
is no way to prevent the Kyuubi from being released." He stated
simply. "We shouldn't even bother trying, not when it's
already begun." He said and his one visible eye flickered over to
the closed door, behind it Naruto was arching off the bed in pain.
"And… we have no idea what is causing Naruto to be sick."</P><P>Iruka
took a deep, shuddering breath. "So, essentially," he said, his
voice uneven and low. "We have no idea what's wrong with him.
But, and this is just a guess, I'd say if we don't find out soon,
he'll die." The tanned man brought his hand to his eyes, rubbing
his fingers along his nose in effort to ease the discomfort in his
mind. His eyes snapped wide open when another of Naruto's screams
tore through the air. "God dammit!" He yelled his voice deep and
ringing. "How long is this going to go on for? Get that damn fox
out of him!" He cried and then burst into the hospital room.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>Sasuke
was doing his best to soothe Naruto, he only kept it up because,
every so often, Naruto's pain would stop long enough for his bright
blue eyes to flicker over to Sasuke, whisper a thanks, and then roll
back into his head as the pain gripped hold of him again. Sasuke
stroked Naruto's spasm-ing hand and shared with him the few tender
memoires Sasuke had. When he ran out of those, he began to tell about
the first time he'd seen Naruto, the first time he'd <I>really
</I>seen Naruto; the real
Naruto. And the blonde seemed to be grateful for this.</P><P>Sasuke
wasn't sure how long this had been going on for, but he hadn't
slept in an even longer time, and Naruto's pain just kept getting
worse and worse. After a particularly violent spell, or rather,
during a particularly violent spell, Iruka burst through the door.
His reflexes slowed by worry and distraught, Sasuke turned to eye the
man and barely had time to take in his rumbled clothing and pale face
before the man was at Naruto's side, performing a series of seals
that looked vaguely familiar to Sasuke and lit off a red light in his
head.</P><P>"Iruka,
what the hell do you think you're doing?" Tsunade's voice
boomed as she (and her huge boobs) tried to squeeze in through the
door with Kakashi at once. Her panic danced in her eyes when she
recognized the seals Iruka was carefully displaying. "<I>Iruka!
</I>You'll kill him you
do that!" She screamed. "Why do you think we haven't just
ripped the damn thing out ourselves?" She cried as she was finally
propelled forward by a push from Kakashi.</P><P>Iruka
didn't even slow his motions; it was obvious to any bystander that
Iruka was a desperate man who believed that desperate times called
for desperate measures. With a last flick of his fingers, Iruka
focused his chakra on the seal he knew to be located on Naruto's
stomach, and let it go. Iruka's power barreled into the boy's
abdomen with uncontrolled force and Naruto's screams turned silent
as he fell back to the bed, his eyes wide in pain, he coughed
hackingly and pedals of red fell from his lips.</P><P>"Was
that… was that the jutsu used to break seals?" Sasuke whispered.
"Do you not… are you…" he gaped at Iruka and then simply
stopped trying. Seeing no other choice of action, Sasuke raised his
arm, curled his hand into a first, and with much more strength then
he thought he had, punched Iruka in the stomach, knowing it wasn't
even half the pain Naruto was going through. "You fucking bastard."</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>"Oh,
my god." Kyuubi breathed out, his voice noticeably smoother since
he'd taken his human form. It had been a long three days, feeling
only brief spells of Naruto's agony and the pull of the seal
calling him out every so often. But this pain… whatever had just
been unleashed inside of the cage with him, it topped it all. "Oh,
my god." He breathed again and curled in on himself, forgetting
that he was a demon lord, forgetting that he had someone to protect,
he lay there and tried to focus on not crying out.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>"What
now?" Kakashi asked uncertainly, trying his best to avoid Sasuke's
eyes.</P><P>Tsunade
held her face in her hands, "Now we wait. We wait and see if Naruto
lives, or if he dies. We'll have to take him… I think we're
going to have to take him off of the pain medication, we're going
to have to isolate him." She shuddered. "There are no recorded
cases of something like this; the brat is more than probably going to
die. I… The human body isn't meant for this sort of pressure."
She said and gestured to Naruto's ever staring eyes.</P><P>"Take
him off of the pain medication?" Sasuke repeated slowly. "Are you
deaf? Can't you hear his screams? Think of what they'll sound
like when… if…" his eyes blazed.</P><P>"I
thought of that," Tsunade said. "And we're going to have to
disregard it. There's nothing we can do." She sat down heavily in
a chair, watching Iruka as the man stared alternatively between
Naruto and his own hands. "If he's not better by tomorrow
morning, and he won't be, then we're going through with it."
She narrowed her eyes at Sasuke's defiant expression. "And that
is my decision as <I>Hokage</I>,
go against my word and I'll have you thrown in jail."</P><P>"You're
going to kill him." Sasuke said and reached out for Naruto's
hand, "He's going to die and it's going to be your fault." He
said and gave her a look that suddenly made her remember that he,
Naruto, and even Sakura were all only teenagers. Nothing more than
children.</P><P>Tsunade
turned towards the door, "No. It's your fault, too, and his,"
she gestured to Kakashi, "and his." She nodded towards Iruka.
"The blame belongs to all of us."</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>Sakura
stared across the table at her mother, who was chatting animatedly
with her husband about an eccentric young man she'd bumped into at
the market that day. Sakura brushed strands of her hair behind her
ear and pushed her food around on her plate. She wasn't quite sure
how she was supposed to feel. Naruto… precious Naruto… had been
sick for a month, and no one had noticed. It wasn't even that he
was simply sick, he was dying, and no one had noticed.</P><P>"Sakura,
dear, is something wrong?" Her mother asked with a sweet smile.
"You're not eating anything. And I even made your favorite meal."</P><P>Sakura
scooped a bite of salad into her mouth and chewed dutifully under her
mother's gaze. "No, I'm fine." She said and her voice
cracked. "I'm fine." She repeated to herself. <I>But
Naruto's not, </I>her
mind whispered.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>Kakashi
kept his face carefully blank under the taught mask that covered his
face. He wondered through the hospital, checking in on friends and
comrades, helping nurses in any way he could, preparing a Clean Room
for Naruto. He had failed as an instructor. A Sensei was supposed to
be like… like a parent; loving and proud, confident, stern, and
watchful. Kakashi was not loving towards Naruto; at least, he'd
never shown it. He'd never shown the boy he was proud of him, or
confident in him, he'd certainly never been stern with the blonde.
But he'd always thought he'd been watchful. Always keeping tabs
on his pupil, always keeping the boy from trouble. But apparently…
apparently he hadn't done a good enough job.</P><P>"Hey,
Kakashi, it's nice to see you again. Wasn't expecting a visit
from you," Kakashi looked up into the face of one of his old
friends; their face swollen and bandaged. "How've you been?"</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>Tsunade
squinted down that the stack of papers she held in her lap, leaning
back in the uncomfortable hospital chair awkwardly. She wasn't sure
why she'd even bothered to have Shizune bring over her paperwork.
She couldn't possibly focus on anything besides Naruto. Her eyes
flickered up to watch the boy who was lying still for the first time
in countless hours. God, she was so worried. Naruto had managed to
cheat death so many times… Tsunade knew too well that it couldn't
last forever.</P><P>She
stood slowly and wondered when she'd started to feel so old. She
slid into the seat Sasuke usually occupied and sighed heavily. She
brushed a loose strand of hair out of her eyes and then placed her
hand on Naruto's forehead, taking note of the damp heat his whole
face seemed covered in. She moved her hand to grip his limp fingers
and then lowered her head to rest on his forearm.</P><p align='center'>**</P><P>Everyone
ended up in front of Naruto's hospital room the next morning. All
of them looking pale, sleep deprived, and worried. Sasuke kept his
expression sour and shot Sakura harsh glares every few minutes.
Sakura shied away from the reassuring arms of Shizune and did her
best not to meet the Uchiha's eyes. Kakashi kept his hands shoved
deep in his pockets, his eyes far away and wild. Iruka alternated
between staring at people helplessly, and Tsunade simply stood
stoically.</P><P>"Is
the isolation room ready?" She asked Kakashi flatly and he nodded.
"Well then," she moved towards the door, "I guess this is the
part you all gather around his bedside and say your goodbyes." She
pushed open the hospital door carefully. "I don't expect him to
come out alive."</P>
