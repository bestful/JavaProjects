attacked the village of Konoha. It was the great Kyuubi, a
nine-tailed fox, powerful beyond the villagers' wildest imaginings.
 It struck with a devastating force that would have demolished the
village, but for one man. Yondaime Hokage, Namikaze Minato,
sacrificed his life to seal the beast inside his infant son, who had
been born that day to Uzumaki Kushina, a beautiful woman with red
hair…<hr size=1 width=100% noshade>There was once a great
demon-god lord, a powerful ruler of the yokai, who wished to extend
his rule to the human world. So he decided that he would have eight
daughters, one for each point of the compass, and that they would
serve under him so that he might rule the world of the spirits still,
while having delegates in the world of humans.
<p>He set about finding
mothers to bear his children. He could not use yokai, because his
daughters must have a connection to both the human and spirit worlds,
but he could not use humans, because the human half would rebel
against his commands. So he decided to father children with eight
animals, whose spirits could easily be dominated by their yokai half,
but who could live in the human world. He lay with a tanuki, a cat,
a turtle, a dog, an eagle, a serpent, a wolf, and a tiger. His work
was done, but before he could return to the spirit world, he
encountered a beautiful kitsune. She spoke to him, inviting him to
come drink saké with her. Once she had gotten him drunk, she
seduced him, and he lay with her. He woke later with no memory of
these events, and returned to the world of the spirits convinced that
all had gone as planned.</p><p>Demons grow fast within
their mother's wombs, so he returned in one month to claim his
daughters. He gathered them to him, but as he went to take them, a
she-kitsune came forward. In her mouth she held a kit with glossy
red fur and nine tiny tails.</p><p>"This, too, is your
daughter," she said, and gave the kit to him. Holding it in his
hand, he could tell that it was stronger than its sisters. Its power
intrigued him, so he took it with him, though he had not planned it.</p><p>He took his nine
daughters, the bijuu, to a home he had prepared for them, a giant
cavern at the bottom of a whirlpool. And there he raised them, for
hundreds of years…</p><u><b>Ku</b></u></p><p>I was the youngest of
my sisters, and the strongest, and the worst behaved. Because of my
kitsune form, I had shape-changing abilities, and I abused them
terribly. I loved nothing better than to take the form of a local
god and go terrorize nearby villagers. Or maybe I would become a
frog, and go converse with the other frogs at the bottom of the lake,
or perhaps a falcon, and soar the skies. But there was one form that
intrigued me most of all.</p><p>When I first began to
take on human form, I had no idea of its subtleties, having no human
in me. I would merely imitate the exact form of a human from a
nearby village. It always delighted me to see them run in terror
from what they assumed to be an evil doppelganger. But gradually,
over time, over a span of centuries, I began to understand the human
shape, the small variances that differentiated them. I began to
create my own forms, taking elements from various humans. Finally, I
settled on one shape; a young female human with deep blue eyes and
hair the same tawny red as my fox fur. This shape felt <i>right</i>
somehow, as if it was the form I would have been born with had I been
born human.</p><p>But of course, this
shape could never feel as right as my natural form, my <i>true</i>
form, that of a nine-tailed demon fox. In this form, I was pure raw
emotion. If I was angry, I might raze a village or crush a mountain
range to pebbles. If I was restless, I might wear a valley in the
earth with my pacing. If the slightest thing saddened me, I might
weep a lake of salty tears. Unlike humans, I did not simply <i>feel</i>
my emotions, I <i>was</i> them. This was what I truly was.</p><p>Father and my sisters
disapproved of my shape-changing into a human. They thought that I
might become one eventually. I merely scoffed, laughed at them.
They simply didn't understand the powers of the kitsune. Only my
eldest sister, a tanuki demon, could begin to understand, but she
much preferred her true form and seldom changed shape. Of course, I
was stronger—much, much stronger than her, so it might be that she
would not be able to retain herself if she took human form too
frequently. But I could. Of that, I was sure.</p><p>When I was young, only
a few hundred years old, Father brought a woman to our home, our
underwater cavern. To the others, she was simply a human creature,
but after my years of study of humans, I could tell that she was a
tall and slender female, with long, dark hair, and soft white eyes
that were glazed and vacant. I asked Father about her, and he told
me that she was of a prominent human clan, that she was under his
enchantment, and that she was pregnant with his child.</p><p>"Why?" I asked.
"You already have nine daughters to rule the earth for you. Why
would you need a human child, too?"</p><p>"You are to rule,"
he replied, "but I wish also to create a legacy, a clan of humans
to rule under you, lords of men."</p><p>A month later, the
woman cried out, and her eyes widened even as they gazed blankly
ahead. Father was not there, and my sisters showed no interest in
her, so, taking my human form, I knelt beside her and took her hand.
I peered down into her anguished face, not with human emotions, not
with pity or comfort, but with a fierce curiosity. Using the sleeve
of her kimono, I wiped the sheen of sweat from her face. I knelt
beside her and held her hand, and she gave birth to two half-human
infants, a male and a female. I turned to show them to their mother,
and she blinked, once, twice, in surprise, then her eyes half-closed
and her raised hand fell limply to her side.</p><p>Moments later, Father
came down the whirlpool. Noticing the twins, he flew to my side.</p><p>"Ah," he said.
"The human has given birth."</p><p>"She's dead," I
said, but he didn't appear to hear me. He picked up the male baby
and looked into its face. It had black hair like its mother, and
glowing red eyes. "Madara," Father murmured. "Your name will
be Uchiha Madara, and I will make a great nation of you. Your chakra
is strong…"</p><p>"Father," I said,
"what of the female?"</p><p>"She has too much
human in her. She is useless, she is nothing. Her name will be
Machigai—she is nothing but my mistake. I had not counted on
twins."</p><p>"What shall we do
with her?"</p><p>"You can have her,"
he said dismissively. "Kill her, abandon her, raise her, whatever
you wish."</p><p>"I will raise her."</p><p>He eyed me
scrutinisingly. "Sometimes I think that you have too much human in
you as well, Ku." He took the male—Madara—and turned. "Now
I will take this one to his grandfather. Farewell, my daughters."</p><p>I stood angrily at the
entrance to our cavern home, glaring after him. There was no human
in me, none at all! My mother was a kitsune and my father was a
demon.</p><p>So how could I be
human?</p><p>The female infant let
out a soft wail and I went over and picked her up. Looking down at
her, I saw that her hair and eyes were a soft dove grey. She cried
again and moved her head from side to side, searching for food. I
loosened the neck of my kimono and lifted her to my breast, willing
milk to flow. It did, and she made contented baby noises as she drank
eagerly.</p><p>Shi, my dog demon
sister, padded over to me and lay down, the tips of her ears level
with the top of my head when I knelt and she rested her head upon her
paws. Her size did not intimidate me; I am much larger in my kitsune
form.</p><p>"Giving suck to a
human brat, Ku? Soon you'll be bearing sons for some nobleman."</p><p>I glared at her, all my
fox ferocity in my blue human eyes. "So Father is allowed to build
a human legacy, but I am not?"</p><p>Shi sneered. "So
you're planning on building a legacy off that brat, Ku? Give it
up. You heard Father. She's too weak, too <i>human</i>." She
rose, and turned, but threw one last taunt over her shoulder. "Sort
of like <i>you</i>."</p><p>Dropping Machigai, I
leapt at Shi, changing to a kitsune in midair. I slammed into her,
pinning her to the stone floor. Raising my claws, I slashed four
cuts across her muzzle.</p><p>"That was a warning,"
I growled. "Insult me again, and I'll kill you!" I lifted my
paw, letting her free, and she darted away with her tails between her
legs.</p><p>Smiling, I returned to
human form and went to pick Machigai up, and, stroking her hair to
calm her, I resumed nursing.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><U><B>Ku</B></U></p><P>I learned early on not
to take my kitsune form around Machigai. Though it did not always go
badly, I had no control over my emotions. I <I>wanted</I> no control
over my emotions, but still, some whim of mine made me want to keep
her alive. I felt like I had to prove—to Father, to my sisters,
and especially to myself—that I could do this. So I always took my
human form around her, and years passed. All went well.</p><P>I noticed, in this
time, that it was difficult to keep a shape other than my true one
for long periods of time. I could keep a human form for about a
month fairly easily, but after that, it would grow exponentially more
difficult each day. At a certain point, the strain would become too
much, and I would burst into my kitsune form, full of impatient and
unreasonable anger. I would then turn on anyone or anything that
moved, and my nine tails would whip out, crumbling walls and ripping
chunks from the floor. It would sometimes be hours before I could
calm myself to any extent. It was more than my usual transformation;
I seemed to lose consciousness, awareness of my being, and later, it
was only with much difficulty that I could begin to remember what had
happened during that time. When I would first calm a bit, I would
survey the wreckage in confusion, not realising that it was me who
had caused the destruction. When one of my sisters finally told me
that it was my doing, I would throw back my head and laugh, my
raucous hilarity echoing off the walls. What a trick, to do this
without even realising it myself! How delightfully strange!</p><P>It wasn't until I
returned to human form that I would even wonder about Machigai. She
seemed to have tremendous luck, for she survived many such mindless
rampages, though she did break her arm once. Not many children could
fare so well being raised by a demon.</p><P>Though Father had said
that she was too human, Machigai proved to be an extraordinary child.
 She learned to speak early, and to crawl, and then to walk. She
neither cried nor smiled much, she was solemn and inquisitive, and a
fast and determined learner. And, unlike me, her curiousity was
balanced out with good sense. She seemed to know instinctively to
stay in the corner of the cavern where she lived, away from my
sisters. And, though I knew it was impossible for a small child to
be so intuitive, I got the feeling that she knew that I was more than
I seemed, although I had stopped taking my demon form around her by
the time she was a year old.</p><P>She grew to be a
beautiful child, too, inheriting her mother's china doll face and
large, gentle eyes. Her face was softly rounded, but she soon lost
her baby fat and grew tall and thin. She kept her soft grey hair
cropped short with a knife I brought her, but she was always feminine
looking, even as a small child. Because I seldom took her out to the
human world, her skin remained a proper noblewoman's pale shade. 
Altogether, she had a definite human beauty about her.</p><P>When I would take her
to the surface, to the human world, Machigai wouldn't frolic about
like most children, but rather would stare at everything fiercely,
with an almost unnatural focus, as if she wanted to absorb as much of
the trees and sun and flowers as possible before returning to the dim
cavern. Sometimes, she would sit quietly for hours, just warming
herself on a rock or watching the wind sway the tree branches. I
knew from my observations of humans that this was unusual behavior
for a child, and I wondered if, despite her pleasing face and
startling intellect, there was something missing form her essential
makeup, or if her brain had been somehow damaged during one of her
falls as an infant. But other than these long, motionless silences,
she seemed fairly normal, so I didn't worry.</p><P>I didn't worry much
about Machigai. I was calm around her, measured, and careful, for I
had extraordinary strength, even in my human form, but never gentle. 
It was not that I in any way deprived her; I was just cool, matter of
fact. I wished to keep her alive, I had no reason to do her harm,
but I was her caretaker always, never her mother, so I never spoiled
her or cooed over her. She was well provided for, but never to the
point of excess. She would be my legacy, but not my daughter.</p><P>I could never tell if
Machigai thought of me as a mother. She was difficult to read, an
enigma, a conundrum. She seldom spoke and never laughed. So,
despite my keen powers of observation, I lived with her for years,
and never knew who she really was.</p><P>It was difficult, more
difficult than I could have imagined, to keep my true form a secret
all those years. To spend most of my time in human form confused and
disoriented me at times, and gave me severe mood swings at others. 
These intense emotions often caused me to change, pushed into demon
form by my exuberance or fury. This happened a few times during the
time I took care of Machigai, but I was usually able to run away from
her before I changed, and then change back and return before my
sisters ate her.</p><P>Then, one day, when
Machigai was about nine years old, I completely lost control. I grew
so enraged over some jibe of Ichi's that I began to change, right
there, in front of Machigai. I had enough self-control left to slow
the transformation, but not to delay it. As my chakra bubbled over
me, morphing my body, Machigai let out a gasp of surprise. This
somehow angered me, and, whirling on her, I swiped at her, scoring
four deep gouges across her chest and face, breaking the china doll.</p><P>Underneath the blood,
her breast still rose and fell, but the small part of my brain that
was still conscious of my actions knew that if she was still in there
when I finished my transformation, she would not survive. And I
wanted her to live, though I couldn't quite remember why.</p><P>So I scooped her up in
one half-hand half-paw and threw her. I threw her up, out of the
cavern, to the surface, to the world of humans. Away from me.</p><P>And I never saw her
again.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p><u><b>Ku</b></u></p><p>It was a relief, at
first, to have Machigai gone. I kept my true form all the time. I
ran every day. I played pranks on my sisters and the local
villagers. My laugh came often and loudly as I luxuriated in my
newfound freedom.</p><p>After a while, however,
I realised that much of what I had done for the past nine years was
to raise Machigai, and now that she was gone, I didn't know what to
do with all the time I had. I tired of my usual pranks, and found
myself moving further and further from home on my expeditions,
searching for something I could not find, could not even name.</p><p>Another change around
that time was that Ichi was sent up to the surface. Of course, all
of us were allowed into the human world, but so far, Father had not
put into action his plan to make us his terrestrial ambassadors.
This was the first step, and cause for many murmurings amongst us.
Ichi, though of course she would fulfill her duty, was not thrilled
to be sent from our home. She even mustered up the courage to ask
Father why she had been chosen, something that I would usually be the
only one to do.</p><p>"You are the eldest,"
he told her. "And your powers of transformation will help you to
enter inconspicuously at first."</p><p>"Why not me?" I
asked, blooming into fox form from the pebble I had been transformed
into. "I am younger, yes, but much stronger. I, too, have powers
of transformation, and am much more skilled and practised with them.
Why not send me first?"</p><p>At this, Father threw
his head back and laughed. "Send you first, Ku? So you can play
tricks and laugh at humans? You already do that. You are too
flighty, mercurial, foolish. You are not ready to rule. <i>If </i>I
send you, I will send you last."</p><p>Snarling with rage, I
leapt into the air and, changing into a white tern, I soared up the
whirlpool into the wide blue sky, leaving a pile of my dung behind in
the cave. Flapping my wings hard, I caught a thermal and soared
upward, circling far above the ground, rice fields spread out below
me like a patchwork quilt. Rivers wound across the blue-green ground
like ribbons; like silvery-blue winding snakes. I calmed in my
soaring bird shape, letting the thermals carry me, angling my wings
to catch the winds. I rose higher and shed my white feathers,
bursting through them as a golden eagle. My sharp eyes caught a
silver shimmer in the rippling river and I angled myself downwards,
shooting towards the ground only to pull up sharp, a wriggling salmon
in my talons. I let out a screech of delight in my victory, then
glided to the top branch of a weathered oak to feast on my kill.</p><p>As soon as I finished
eating the fish, my anger rushed back into my now undistracted mind.
If! <i>If</i> he sent me! And Ichi—<i>Ichi</i> was to go first!
I was far more fit to the job than her—she was foolish, malevolent,
and unintelligent. She was more likely to get herself captured by
humans than to rule them. But I—I would rule them, supreme
justice, a tyrant, a queen, a god. I would never be caught or
trapped, I would never be made subservient by mortals, for I could go
as a human among them, as a wild animal in the forest, or as a giant
fox, omnipotent, all-knowing, terrifying. I—<i>I</i> could rule.
But Ichi? She could never be a leader.</p><p>In my fury, I dove from
the tree branch on which I perched, landing lightly on lion's paws.
 I ran wildly through the forest, blinded by my rage. I flickered
through forms as I ran; deer, tiger, rabbit, horse, wolverine,
leopard, monkey. Finally, I burst into my true form, and let my
anger devour my soul, feast on my flesh and give birth to
destruction. I cared for nothing; I knew nothing but rage, rage and
devastation.</p><p>I know not what
happened after that.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>I woke later, who knows
how much later, where I had fallen when exhaustion finally bore me
down. All around me was the wreckage of what had used to be a
forest. Ancient trees were toppled, their trunks splintered by
chunks of jagged stone. Standing, I arched my back, stretching like
a cat. I shook heavily, and debris flew from my fur. I smiled
wickedly at the destruction, though anger no longer flooded my veins.
 I felt no more urge to destroy. In fact, I felt oddly calm, serene.
 Leaping atop an enourmous chunk of stone, I surveyed into the
distance and caught a glimpse of treetops—forest that I had not yet
demolished. Squinting, I thought I saw a distant shimmer beyond
them. A city? It gave me an idea, and I moved towards it.</p><p>So Father would not
send me to rule yet. But he could not stop me venturing to the
surface. I would find this city, and make it my own. I would show
him my power.</p><p>I broke into a
lolloping run, and then a gallop, leagues flying by beneath my feat.
When I reached the edge of the forest I transformed, and ran through
it as a deer, not as quickly, but far less conspicuously. My
animalian body was still powered by demon strength, so I soon neared
the city. Ascending a cliff, I gazed down on the village that would
be mine, and wanted nothing more than to leap down amongst the
buildings and enforce my rule.</p><p><i>Patience,</i> I
reminded myself. <i>Stealth. Reconnaissance.</i></p><p>I soared as a bird
across the sky.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Years passed, I knew
not how many. Ichi was sent to a human village, Sunagakure, and was
captured, sealed in a teakettle. Ni was sent out, and was captured
by another village, Kumogakure. Shi was dominated as well—of the
first four, only San remained unsealed, and she is far too stupid to
do anything with her freedom, much less rule. Go, Roku, Shichi, and
Hachi were to be sent out soon, and I suspected that they would fare
better. I wanted no chance to be overshadowed, so I decided that it
was time to act.</p><p>I was walking towards
the city in human form when I saw them. Cresting a bluff, I glanced
down into a clearing and glimpsed the humans. They were both male,
and I guessed one to be in his thirties, and the other to be about
ten or eleven. The elder of the two was tall, with untidy white hair
and strange facial markings. The younger one had yellow hair that,
despite an obvious effort on his part to neaten it, was nearly as
disorderly as that of the white-haired man. The older one appeared
to be instructing the younger, who was doing things with his hands
that caused his chakra to move in strange ways. There was a puff of
smoke, and a small frog hopped from the boy's hands towards me. I
leapt behind a tree just in time; a moment later, the boy came
running through the trees where I had been standing a moment before.
He blundered through the forest for a while before returning to the
man with empty hands. They spoke briefly, then the boy began to
mould his chakra again.</p><p>What a wonderful trick
it would be, I thought slowly, to fool these humans into thinking I
was their friend. The small, yellow-haired one especially. I knew I
could fool him. I would convince him that we were friends, then I
would use that to take over the village. I would become one of them.</p><p>Since I was to befriend
the child, I decided to take a child's form. I transformed into a
small, red-haired girl, perhaps nine or ten years old. Looking down,
I realised with a shock what I was wearing. I was clad in an
oversized tunic, patched and colourless, but clean and neat. The
same thing Machigai had been wearing the last time I had seen her.
The first thing that had come to my mind when I had thought of a girl
of her age. I hastily shook my head to clear it. Machigai was dead.
 Even if she had survived her wounds, she would have died of old age
long ago. I transformed again, and this time I wore a large orange
shirt and short pants that fell to my knees. A bright blue bandana
held my hair in place atop my head. I was ready.</p><p>Purposefully tripping
over a root, I sent myself tumbling head over heels down the slope,
landing their feet. Hurriedly scrambling up, I eyed them nervously.</p><p>"Hello," said the
tall, white-haired man. "Who are you?"</p><p>"Ku," I blurted out
before I could think of any other name. I hurried to explain. "It's
short for—for Kushina," I stumbled. "My name is Uzumaki
Kushina."</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade><u><b>Minato</b></u></p><p>I was startled by the
girl's sudden appearance, but Jiraiya-sensei appeared not to be, so
I did my best to hide my surprise. Jiraiya-sensei asked for her name
and she replied that it was Uzumaki Kushina. A strange name, like
mine. It is unusual to find names relating to ocean storms this far
inland. I like my name, though. Minato—port, harbor. A kind
name.</p><p>Uzumaki Kushina,
though. That name was fierce and strong, like the girl's fiery
hair, so different from mine. But her eyes, those were like
mine—soft blue, but with a hidden ferocity. Strong. Deep. I
could see in her eyes that she was the kind of girl who could be my
friend, just as I saw kindness in Jiraiya's eyes behind his rough,
joking exterior.</p><p>Jiraiya-sensei asks her
where she is from, and she hesitates, then replies that she is from a
former ninja village, a small village that we will not have heard of.
 She is not a ninja, but wishes to learn.</p><p>Jiraiya glances at me
questioningly, and I shrug. He says that he could teach her if she
wishes, that she could learn side-by-side with me and my team
members.</p><p>She smiles.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P><U><B>Madara</B></U></p><P>The people of Konoha
thought that I was dead. They had too much faith in their precious
Hokage—they seriously believed that he could defeat me—me, who
had never lost a battle! He thought that he had defeated me only
because that was what I wanted him to believe. It had been time for
me to disappear, before people realised that I wasn't getting any
older.</p><P>It was true, I did not
age. I knew not why or how it had come about, but it appeared that I
would remain thirty years old for the rest of my life, which most
likely wouldn't end until I was killed in battle. While
immortality could be quite handy, it was sure to have aroused
suspicion, so I left. But Ichidaime Hokage, my teammate, didn't
want to let me go, being convinced that the two of us had 'bonded'
or some such nonsense. So, in the end, I had to fight him, though I
only wanted to leave peacefully. I considered killing him, but did
not wish to have search teams hunting me down, so I made him believe
that I was dead, that he had killed me. And, finally, I left in
peace.</p><P>So I wandered, for many
years. Sometimes I would do mercenary work, but never enough to
attract Konoha's attention. It was convenient, if dull, to be
dead. I traveled for years, how many I do not know, until, one day,
I met a strange woman on the forest road.</p><P>"Halt, Uchiha
Madara," she ordered, and I stopped, shocked. So word of my
continued existence had finally gotten out?</p><P>I looked at the woman
carefully, trying to place her. She was tall, lean, and muscular,
with a hard look about her. Her dove grey hair was pulled into a
topknot in samurai style, with a few loose, neatly cropped strands
falling across her face. She would have had a pretty face, with soft
grey eyes and a shapely chin, but for the jagged scars running across
it and the steely look in her eyes. Her eye, I should say, as a worn
eyepatch obscured one that was crossed by a scar.</p><P>She wore a long woolen
cloak, fastened at her right shoulder by a dull brooch. Two soft
leather boots showed beneath the hem, encrusted with the dry, cracked
mud of many roads. She had a small pack thrown over one shoulder,
and in her hand she held a sturdy yew staff. A metallic glint came
from the gap in he cloak, hinting at more sinister weapons.</p><P>Something in her
sparked a glint of almost-memory, like a dream long forgotten.</p><P>"Who are you?" I
asked.</p><P>She smiled. "Uchiha
Machigai."</p><P>"Uchiha?" My brow
furrowed. "I thought that all of my descendants had dark hair and
eyes."</p><P>She smiled again, a
mysterious, enigmatic smile. "Maybe I am not one of your
descendants."</p><P>"But Uchiha…?"</p><P>Another smile. "I
never said that I was not one of your relatives."</p><P>This I knew was
impossible. "But I am the founder of the Uchiha clan—the first
Uchiha."</p><P>"And your father?"</p><P>I hesitated, my brow
furrowed. "I—I—"</p><P>"Uchiha Madara, I am
your twin sister."</p><P>"Impossible!"</p><P>"Is it?"</p><P>I stood still for a
moment, dumbfounded. Then my gaze hardened into a glare and I drew
one of my swords.</p><P>"If you are my
sister, then prove it."</p><P>She didn't have to
ask what I meant. She swung her staff around, gripping in with both
hands at waist height. Her smile taunted me, and I charged.</p><P>I didn't even see her
hands move. One moment, my sword was plunging towards her breast,
the next it was wrenched from my hands, the blade buried nearly two
centimeters into her wooden staff. I leapt back to ready myself for
another attack, drawing my second sword as she tossed the staff
aside, holding her hands up in a defensive position. This startled
me—why throw away two weapons when I am obviously still armed? She
saw the question in my bloodred eyes, and answered it.</p><P>"I don't want to
give myself an advantage."</p><P>Growling with rage at
the heavily implied insult, I ran at her again, swinging my katana in
a deadly dance. She tapped the blade lightly aside with a folded fan
that seemed to have appeared in her hand. I smirked at this—razor
fans are women's weapons—strong, certainly, but far inferior to
my stolid sword. I let myself charge past her as she intended, but
spun behind her and swung at her as she turned. My blow did not
contact her, though—it glanced noisily off her now unfolded fan. I
was surprised that her iron fan withstood a blow from my true steel
sword, but I did not hesitate. Swinging my blade around, I clove
upwards around her guard, but she darted away, lunging at me from the
side with her fan. I dodged, then leapt back. Still holding her
iron fan two-handed, Machigai dropped her pack and used her teeth to
undo the brooch that held her cloak. She spat it to the ground, and
the grey cape fell off her shoulders. Beneath it, she wore a dark
green kimono-style tunic, belted at the waist, and grey-brown
trousers that tucked into the tops of her boots, just below the
knees. Several unornamented leather sheathes hung from her belt, and
I suspected that she had more knives hidden on her person. Smiling,
she beckoned me with her fan.</p><P>From my previous
attack, I could guess that we were fairly evenly matched at
hand-to-hand close-range fighting, so it would be fruitless to
continue that manner of combat. I would have to use ninjutsu.</p><P>While living in Konoha,
I had made discoveries in ninjutsu beyond most people's wildest
dreams. Not only did I possess a unique kekkai genkai, the
sharingan, and its second form, the mangekyou, but I had also
perfected the process of elementally recomposing chakra, resulting in
two new jutsu—one for each of my chakra types. I had not intended
to use either in this battle, but Machigai had proved a formidable
opponent. It was time.</p><P>I decided on a
lightning type attack, targeting her metal weapon which she gripped
bare-handed. Concentrating chakra to my fingers with a hand seal, I
urged it towards its natural lightning form. It began to crackle to
life, and I blew, my breath gaining strength from it to carry the
lightning towards Machigai. It struck hard and fast, sure to hit!</p><P>But somehow it did not.
 As it approached her, it split down the middle, breaking around her
like a wave around a stolid rock. Then something exceedingly strange
happened. The crackling bolts slowed and spread around her, forming
a protective cocoon about a metre from her body.</p><P>"Wind type chakra?"
I guessed. "<I>And</I> lightning?"</p><P>She nodded. "Earth
as well."</p><P>I was flabbergasted. 
Three chakra types? It was unheard of. "What, then is you kekkai
genkai?" I asked, masking my astonishment.</p><P>"Kekkai genkai?" 
Her brow furrowed in confusion. "I have none."</p><P>Three types of chakra
and no kekkai genkai? I had never even dreamt of such a thing. My
mind was now set.</p><P>"All right," I
said. "I believe you."<p></p><P>She looked skeptical. 
"Just like that?"<p></p><P>"Yes." I smirked. 
"If you're this strong, you must be related to me."</p><P>Cautiously, she let
down her lightning shield, and I could better see her sneer. "Cocky,
aren't you?"</p><P>"Just honest." I
shrugged. "I am strong. Probably the strongest man alive. That's
just facts. It would make sense that my sister would be strong,
too."</p><P>"Strongest man alive,
hm?" She smiled secretively. "Uchiha Madara, this is not true."</p><P>"You know of someone
stronger?"<p></p><P>"No. Uchiha Madara,
you are no man. Our mother was human, true. I believe you know of
her, since you were raised by her father. But <I>our</I> father…
he was far from human. He was a ruler among the demon-gods."</p><P>"It makes sense. I
always knew that I was special…"</p><P>"And it will explain
your apparent immortality, which you have no doubt wondered about."</p><P>"Yes…" I trailed
off, then recollected my thoughts. "So, I assume you did not hunt
me down simply for a touching family reunion."</p><P>"I did not."</p><P>"What for, then? You
had need of my strength?"</p><P>"No. I wish to found
an… organisation, of sorts."</p><P>"An organisation? I
assume you're not planning a ladies' tea society."</p><P>"No, I plan to found
a group of powerful shinobi to help me with some… objectives that I
have. In exchange, I will give them money, power, and prestige. We
will be feared and awed by all the world!"</p><P>"And you want me to
join?"</p><P>"In a manner of
speaking."</p><P>My patience for her
enigmatic manner of speech was wearing thin. "Can you not speak
plainly, woman?"</p><P>She smiled. "I wish
you to be my façade, acting as a leader in my place, while, in
reality, it is in my control."</p><P>"Why not simply
assume leadership yourself?"</p><P>Walking over to where
she had tossed her staff, she picked it up and pulled my blade from
it with astonishing ease. As she spoke, she tested its balance,
holding it in perfect equilibrium. "Imagine, Madara, that you were
considering joining a powerful secret organisation." She lightly
pressed the edge of the blade to her fingertip, then raised her
eyebrows at how easily she drew blood. "Of course, despite its
secrecy, rumors have gotten out about it amongst the underground
elite. Rumors about its leader. Would you join, knowing that it was
led by a woman?" She threw the sword at me lightly. "That's a
fine blade you have there."</p><P>I snatched it out of
the air in front of me. "No, I would not. I can see your point. 
But rumors of this organisation would spread a bit too quickly for
your tastes if it was found that Uchiha Madara was the leader, would
they not?"</p><P>She nodded curtly. 
"They would. We don't want third-class scum scrabbling for a
position. And t hat is the reason for the second façade."</p><P>"Second façade…?"<p></p><P>She hesitated for a
moment, as if deciding where to begin. "You see… I, too have
created a clan, though of course, they do not bear the name Uchiha,
but rather the name of my late husband."</p><P>"How many do they
number?"<p></p><P>"Very few. I am not
like you, Madara, marrying my half-sister and having twelve
concubines to expand your legacy."</p><P>My face hardened. "It
is my duty to produce heirs."</p><P>She laughed softly. 
"Your duty and your pleasure. But no, my clan was never like
yours. It was very small."</p><P>"Was?"</p><P>"Unfortunately, most
were killed in the Amegakure civil wars. Only one remains."</p><P>"And this one… he
is special?"</p><P>"Very. You see,
while neither I nor my husband had a kekkai genkai, a very unique one
occurs every so often in my family line. You have heard of the
rinengan?"</p><P>My eyes widened and my
words came hard and fast. "Of course. Everyone has. You mean to
say—"</p><P>"My descendant Nagato
has inherited this strange gift. He has been trained, I believe, by
a shinobi of your former village, and he has an intense desire that
will lead him to seek power. He will act as a leader to the members,
but will believe you to be the true leader."</p><P>She had thought this
through. I was almost impressed.</p><P>"And what shall we
call this organisation?"</p><P>She responded with one
word, and that word contained such enigmatic meaning that it sent
shivers down my spine. Throughout the days and weeks that would
follow, this word would echo through my mind.</p><P>"Akatsuki."</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><p>"Come <i>on!</i>"</p><p>"No. We'll get in trouble."</p><p>"You're such a prick, Nato. Jiraiya-sensei will never
notice if we just take it for one hour!"</p><p>"I'm not coming!"</p><p>"You're such a prick. I'm going by myself,
then." Turning, I headed off along familiar streets. A
moment later, I heard hurried footsteps, then Minato was walking beside
me. I grinned. "Knew you wanted to come."</p><p>"Dammit, Ku, you're going to get us is trouble again!"</p><p>"Again? Me? Why, who was the one who masterminded the
great give-the-Hokage-on-the-mountain-facepaint operation?"</p><p>"You!"</p><p>I ignored him. "And <i>who</i> thought that it would be a good idea
to steal Tsunade-hime's saké?"</p><p>"You again."</p><p>"And who was it who died Sandaime-sama's robes orange?"</p><p>"Ku, you did all those things!"</p><p>"Exactly. I'm a genius."</p><p>He sighed in exasperation. "Fine. Whatever. But <i>why</i>
do we have to steal Jiraiya-sensei's book?"</p><p>"Aren't you curious about what's in it?"</p><p>"I <i>know</i> what's in it."</p><p>"But aren't you curious about what it's actually like?"</p><p>"No! Pervert! Girls aren't supposed to be pervs!"</p><p>"And why not? Are we all supposed to be pricks like you?"</p><p>"Tomboy!"</p><p>"Goody-two-shoes!"</p><p>"Pervert!"</p><p>"Prick! Come on, let's go!"</p><p align="center"><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Life as a human was interesting.</p><p>Of course, they had strange ideas and morals that they imposed upon me, but
the lived interesting lives. It was almost fun, this strange façade. 
Sometimes I even dreamed of making this my life, of forgetting my plan—but no,
I had to remember that I could never be one of them. I reminded myself of this every three weeks
when I retreated into the mountains alone. The others believed that I was visiting my
family, but in reality I was by myself to take my own true form. That was the only way I was able to pull of
this most excellent of tricks.</p><p>The boy—Minato—was easy to befriend. I think he looked on me as a younger sister, and he was always ready to
defend, to protect. He did his best to
look out for me, tried to keep me out of trouble. I, in turn, tried to get him to loosen up, to
actually let himself have fun. We were
an odd pair, but we got along well.</p><p>There was something else about him—something strange. I was happy when I was with him. I wondered if this was what the humans called
friendship, or love. I had heard both of
these words, and understood that they were similar, but not the same thing, but
I did not know how to differentiate between them, as I had sometimes heard them
used interchangeably. But whatever they
were, they were human emotions, and I was beginning to feel them towards
Minato.</p><p>My plan was beginning to fall apart.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>"Buy me ramen, Nato!"</p><p>"You had ramen for lunch. And
breakfast. And probably all your meals
yesterday."</p><p>"But ramen's so great!"</p><p>"Fine. I have something to tell you
anyway. I might as well tell you over
dinner."</p><p>"Yay! Let's go to Ichiraku!" Grabbing his hand, I pulled him along behind
me as I dashed ahead.</p><p>"Kushina…"</p><p>I put down my chopsticks and turned to Minato. I could tell this was important—he only
called me by my full name when he was really serious.</p><p>"What, Nato?"</p><p>"Kushina… Ku… you know how I'm going to become Hokage?"</p><p>"It'd be hard <i>not</i> to know, way you're always talking about it."</p><p>"Well…" He fidgeted in his seat a
bit. "I have to go train for a while,
outside of Konoha. Just Jiraiya-sensei
and me."</p><p>"Okay." This was his big secret? He had to go on a trip? "So, like a long training mission?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"When will you be back?"</p><p>He mumbled so that I could barely hear him. "About three years…"</p><p>"What?!" I leapt to my feet,
upsetting my stool and overturning my bowl of ramen. "Three years?! What the hell?!"</p><p>"Calm down, Kushina." Minato
obviously had been expecting this reaction.</p><p>"Calm down? Gods…" I righted my stool and sank onto it. "Three years…"</p><p>"About that." He glanced over at me,
fuming with my arms crossed tightly. "Look,
I don't want to leave, but I have to if I ever want to become Hokage. It'll just be a few years. You won't even notice I'm gone."</p><p>"Right." I slumped forward in my
seat. "Fine. Go. I
don't care."</p><p>Something dawned on his face and he looked surprised. "Wait... you're actually going to miss me?"</p><p>"'Course I am, dummy." I
scowled. "You're my best friend."</p><p>"Here," he said suddenly. His fingers
fumbled at his wrist, unfastening the bracelet he always wore. He grabbed my hand and pressed the bracelet
into my palm, folding my fingers over it. "I'll come back for this."</p><p>"But—"</p><p>He smiled. "I'm sure my mum would've
understood. Listen, I'm going to create
a new jutsu, from some writings of Uchiha Madara's. I'll teach it to you when I get back, okay?" I nodded solemnly and he stood, still holding
my hand. I've really got to go pack,
now. I'm leaving tomorrow." Then, more softly "Goodbye, Ku."</p><p>"'Bye," I whispered as he disappeared into the night.</p><p>I glanced at my hand, tightly clutching Minato's precious bracelet.</p><p>"He'd <i>better</i> come back for it," I growled.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>"Hey! HEY!" someone shouted from
behind me. "Kushina!" I turned and saw someone running after
me. I stopped walking and waited
impatiently for him to catch up. He ran
clumsily, and was panting by the time he caught up to me.</p><p>"Hey," I said, finally recognising him. "You're that kid from Ichiraku, aren't you?"</p><p>He answered between gasps. "Yeah—my dad—owns
it—and I'm not—really—a kid. I'm—older—than
you."</p><p>"Uh-huh," I said apathetically. "So,
you had something to tell me?"</p><p>His face flushed red. "Well—uh—something
to—ask you—actually." I raised my
eyebrows and waited impatiently. "Um—well—doyouwanttogooutwithme?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>He hurried on, his face growing more and more crimson. "We could just go to Ichiraku if you want, or
we could go somewhere nicer. I'd pay, of
course—"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Huh?" His face was almost comical;
it was so shocked and confused.</p><p>"Sorry, but no. I don't want to go
out with you."</p><p>"Please?"</p><p>I sighed. "Listen. If you just walk away now, I'll pretend this
never happened. Or, you could ask me out
again. And then I'll hit you."</p><p>He decided to be an idiot. "Maybe a
movie?"</p><p>Before he knew what was happening, he was on the ground clutching his
jaw. I stood over him, glaring down.</p><p>"There's a nice girl who lives near Ichiraku, Yuri or something. I'm sure she'd be more willing to go out with
you than me." I shook back my sleeve to
show the azure beads that encircled my wrist. "I'm waiting for someone else."</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>I sang softly to myself as I strolled into the forest, a lilting demon
melody with chords unusual to human music. It was a quiet summer day, and Minato's teammates were gone on a
mission, so I was going to bathe in a forest pool, as was my habit on days such
as this. I could have gone to the
bathhouse, but I preferred the relaxing solitude of the cool forest springs. The clamour of human life was still
bewildering at times, and I often needed to be by myself.</p><p>I didn't stop upon reaching the first pool I encountered, but continued on
to one I knew well, a small, sun-dappled pool in a grassy clearing. Shedding my clothes at the water's edge, I
plunged into the icy water. I dipped my
head beneath the surface and opened my eyes, surveying the gravely bottom
through crystal water. I stayed under
until I could hold my breath no longer, then burst upward, my long hair
clinging to my wet body. I laughed for
pure joy, gulping in air.</p><p>"Kushina?"</p><p>I spun around to face—Minato! We
stood blinking at each other for a long moment before we both remembered that I
was naked, covered only by my clinging wet hair. He flushed bright red and turned around.</p><p>"Sorry, I'll go—I didn't realise—"</p><p>"No, stay." Climbing from the water,
I snatched up my clothes and hurriedly pulled them on. They were reluctant to go on, sticking to my
damp body, but soon I was dressed, and I ran to Minato, spinning him around and
flinging myself into his arms.</p><p>"Wow, Nato, you're so tall!" I held
him at arm's length to see him clearly, then threw my arms around him
again. "I missed you so much!"</p><p>Minato was clearly bewildered by this sudden abundance of affection, but he
hugged me dutifully until I pulled away. Then he took my hand and gazed over me.</p><p>"You've really grown, too, Ku." His
gaze lingered a moment on my chest as he said this, and I smacked him across
the head.</p><p>"Nato, you perv!" I scolded appreciatively. "What happened to that mild-mannered little prick I knew?"</p><p>"Uh… he ran away?"</p><p>I smiled up at him, and we stood still for a while, gazing on each other,
and then Minato pulled me out of the shadow of the trees into the sun. Holding my hand out, he smiled at the bracelet
on it.</p><p>"You don't think I've forgotten my promise, do you?"</p><p>"Promise?" It was hard to remember
anything, now that my best friend was back after so many years.</p><p>"I promised to teach you my new jutsu! Now here, you'll need this." He
placed something in my outstretched palm.</p><p>"A water balloon?"</p><p>He smiled. "You'll see…"</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><p>Author's Note: This chapter contains, or rather, is made almost exclusively of, a lime leaning towards a lemon. Reader discretion is advised among those of the chibi sort.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>A new feeling was
building inside of me, like the friendship or love I felt towards
Minato, but this one I could place. It was called lust.</p><p>I had cared for him
before, when we were children, but this was something new. When I
saw him, tall and handsome with his piercing blue eyes, I <i>wanted</i>
him. Not just a desire to be around him, but a new, strange desire
that I knew of only from Jiraiya-sensei's dirty books. This, I
knew, must be the final stage of my mental transformation into a
human. In desperation, I made a decision.</p><p>I told Minato and
Jiraiya that an urgent call had come from home requiring me to leave
immediately. I smiled distracted at Minato, and my last sight as I
slipped away into the forest was of him with his hand still
outstretched where I had pulled mine away.</p><p>As soon as I was out of
sight of Konoha, I ran, morphing midstep into a giant tiger. I
poured my strength into my legs, letting the forest fly by on either
side of me. I lost myself in the exhilaration of the running until I
changed into my kyuubi form, and then I kept on running, my powerful,
enourmous strides easily covering the distance to the cave where I
had once lived.</p><p>Standing at the brink
of the whirlpool, I hesitated a moment, reluctant to reenter the home
I had left. But I needed to seek council.</p><p>I took a deep breath
and plunged over the edge.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Of course he was out.
Father's visits were rare, especially now that only four of my
sisters remained at home—Go had been sent out by now. So I had
never really expected him to be home when I arrived.</p><p>But it was with the
greatest impatience that I waited for the next four months.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>I was upon Father the
moment her arrived, my nine tails swirling around him as I spoke, so
fast that I was unintelligible. Irritated, he flung me back from him
using pure force of spiritual energy. I flew through the air until
my body hit the far wall, then fell to the floor beneath. Father
stood over me, looking slightly amused.</p><p>"So, what is of such
great importance that my prodigal daughter must return, seeking my
advice?"</p><p>I pulled myself to my
feet and shook vigourously, sending debris flying from my heavy coat.
 "I have been living in the human world for the past seven years,
Father."</p><p>"I know. I am a god,
after all."</p><p>"During that time, I
met a young male human, and, well…"</p><p>"You have begun to
lust after him."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>He paused a moment. "I
assume that you were in human form when this occurred?" I nodded.
"You have probably noticed that while you assume that shape, you
are just as suspect to the needs to eat, drink, sleep, and relieve
yourself as any other human. It works the same way with the human
need for reproduction, which leads to the human desire for sexuality.
 There is no harm in following this urge, just as there is no harm in
eating or drinking while in your human form. There is no harm in
sleeping with this human, though if reproduction is you aim, I fear
that you will fail, as you will not be able to hold your human form
for long enough to bear the child to term. There is one precaution
you should take, though."</p><p>"What is it?" My
brain was still buzzing with the idea that <i>it was alright to sleep
with Minato.</i> I could have what I desired.</p><p>"Do not fall in love
with him. Don't delude yourself that you can ever be together as
equals. He could never love you, knowing what you are, and you,
loving him, could never keep such a secret from him. Never forget
this, and never let yourself love him."</p><p>"Yes, Father." If
only he knew that it was already too late.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade><u><b>Minato</b></u></p><p>I was in my flat when
Kushina returned, reading over the profiles of the team of
twelve-year-olds I was to lead. She crept in silently while I read,
with her stealth that seemed superhuman at times. So quiet was she,
and so absorbed was I in my reading, that I didn't notice her until
she stood in the doorway to my study and said very softly "Minato".</p><p>"Kushina."
Standing, I strode swiftly over to her, smiling warmly.</p><p>What happened next took
me completely by surprise. No sooner had I reached Kushina then she
had wrapped her arms around my neck, pulled my face to hers, and
kissed me, deep and fiercely.</p><p>For a moment, I
stiffened with shock, but then my male instincts took over and I
wrapped my arms around her and pulled her closer to me, eliminating
any semblance of space between us. One hand gripped her fiery hair
while the other slid down her lower back in a desperate attempt to
bring her closer yet to me. She broke free to gasp for air, and I
pressed my lips to her collarbone, breathing in the sweet aroma of
her flesh. She made use of my preoccupation to slide her cool
fingers up my shirt, dancing playfully along my chest. I hesitated a
moment as the magnitude of Kushina's desires began to dawn on me,
but then her nose traced up my jaw and her lips brushed my earlobe,
and I lost myself again in her passion.</p><p>Kushina's hands
continued up and around my back, then entangled themselves in the
fabric of my shirt and pulled it up over my head, mussing up my hair.</p><p>"Kushina…" I
gripped her face between my hands and stared into her eyes.
"Kushina, we can't do this."</p><p>She grinned wickedly.
"And why not? We're both adults, we know what we're doing.
And Minato, <i>I love you,</i>" she breathed, closing her eyes in
the ecstasy of her words.</p><p>"Kushina."</p><p>"I love you, Minato.
I <i>love</i> you!" She had an almost childlike excitement in her
voice, as if the words somehow liberated her. "I love you." She
grabbed my shoulders, and, with remarkable strength, threw me down
onto my bed. "I love you, and I <i>want</i> you." She pulled
her shirt over her head and then unzipped her shorts and tugged them
off.</p><p>"I do, too," I
gasped, my voice full of an almost painful longing. "But—but we
can't—because—because—" I was sure that I'd had good
arguments, but I couldn't seem to remember them. The sight of
Kushina standing before me, barely dressed, had driven all other
thoughts from my mind.</p><p>Sensing my weakness
like some great predator, Kushina climbed atop me and leaned in to
kiss me ferociously, her teeth nearly drawing blood from my lips. My
hands reached up tentatively to the back of her bra while hers were
occupied with the button and zipper of my pants. With my final ounce
of willpower, I tried to take my hands away, but the battle was lost.
 Unable to undo the clasp, I broke it off and threw it from me. Her
bra fell away, and I pulled her bare chest to mine. I could feel her
heartbeat through her breast, pulsing fast as adrenaline surged
through her. Only one barrier now stood between us and what we
wanted, and we pulled it away, not caring how we tore the
undergarments from each other's bodies. At last, we pressed
together uninhibitedly, our breath coming in erratic gasps as our
hands struggled to touch as much skin as possible. Kushina dug her
fingers deep into my hair and locked her mouth on mine. In the
brief, yet painfully long moments when we pulled apart, only one
phrase escaped her rosy lips.</p><p>"Minato—I love
you."</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><p>Author's Note:
Machigai is sometimes referred to in this chapter as Gin-sama. This
is because gin means silver, and this is the name given her because
of her hair colour.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade><u><b>Machigai</b></u></p><p>I was known a bit in
Iwagakure, and in secret, I had influence in that country. It was I
who had orchestrated the war with Konoha, and since then I had spent
a significant amount of time there, making sure that all was going
according to plan. I was Iwagakure when I found The Boy.</p><p>He was nearly dead when
I found him, half his body crushed by an enourmous boulder, and the
eye was missing from the left side of his face. Leaning forward to
feel for breath, I was surprised to see that the missing eye had been
surgically removed by a medic ninja.</p><p>Using my earth-type
chakra, it was easy to lift the boulder off of him with a wall of
soil. Glancing down, I saw that his right eye had survived. It was
bloodred—a sharingan.</p><p>My mind raced as I took
his small body into my arms. Iwagakure had made revolutionary
advances recently in medicine and technology, and I was known in a
nearby town as a traveling priestess who had helped them on several
occasions. If I could persuade them to help him, everything could
fall together. The boy could be the final puzzle piece that made my
plan succeed.</p><p>I ran to the town and
straight to the hospital. Ignoring the other patients in the waiting
room, I strode purposefully over and laid him on the counter.</p><p>"This child needs
medical attention," I hissed urgently to a cheerful nurse in a pink
uniform.</p><p>The nurse swallowed
nervously. "I can see that, Gin-sama, and we'd be glad to help,
but… is there a problem? You seem… agitated."</p><p>"He's a Konoha
ninja." There was no use hiding it; they'd know as soon as they
saw his eye, anyway.</p><p>A bit of panic crept
into the nurse's smile. "You'd—you'd better speak to
Ashitawa-giisama. Yumi," she called to another nurse, who glanced
up. "Put this boy in a room, take his vitals, and put him on an
IV. I've got to take Gin-sama to see Ashitawa-giisama." Yumi
nodded and brought a gurney over. I lowered the boy onto it, then
hurried away after the nurse in pink.</p><p>She stopped at a closed
door and tapped sharply on it. The voices within halted and someone
called "Come in". We entered into a simple study with
bookshelf-lined walls. Two elderly men were seated across from each
other at a central desk.</p><p>"Toyoshima-giisama,
Ashitawa-giisama." The nurse bowed, and I nodded my head
respectfully. "Gin-sama is here, and she needs to speak to
Ashitawa-giisama about something important."</p><p>The elder of the men
smiled. "I'm sure that Toyoshima-sama would be interested, too.
You go on, Tomi. Gin-sama can talk to the two of us." The nurse
bowed and left, and Ashitawa shifted in his chair to face me.
"Konichiwa-gozaimasu, Gin-sama. I am pleased to meet you; I have
heard of your kind deeds towards the people of this town. I am
Ashitawa Taro, the hospital director, and this is my good friend
Toyoshima Hikaru, the director of commerce. Now, how may we help
you?" He folded his hands before him and looked on attentively.</p><p>"There is a boy with
me who has been grievously injured and requires medical treatment."</p><p>"Then I don't see
why it shouldn't be given him. We are a hospital, after all."</p><p>"But, sir… he is a
Konoha ninja."</p><p>"I don't see how
that makes a difference."</p><p>"But Ashitawa-san,"
Toyoshima interjected. "Surely you can't be serious. Our
country's at war with the Land of Fire. Even so, I would see no
reason not to treat a civilian from Fire country, but this boy is a
ninja. Not only has he probably killed our men, but if you treat
him, you could be tried for treason. Even <i>you</i> could not be so
naïve as to help him."</p><p>Ashitawa smiled. "That
is good business thinking that will get you far in life. It is no
wonder that such a knowledgeable man is our director of commerce."
I made a noise of protest, but he pressed on. "If this hospital
was a business, I would certainly take your advice. But, you see, it
is not. It is an institution for the good of the people. So we will
serve the boy, and if that is treason, then so be it." He turned
back to me. "Come with me, Gin-sama, and we will see what we can
do."</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade><u><b>Obito</b></u></p><p><i>Kakashi? Rin?
Minato?</i></p><p>I struggled up through
clouds of blackness towards a bright electric light. Half of my body
was sore, but half was heavy and dead-feeling, and completely numb.</p><p>"…couldn't
replace his left eye, but it looks like a medic-nin removed it, so it
should heal cleanly…"</p><p><i>Medic-nin? Rin? Is
Rin here?</i></p><p>"We could give him a
glass eye, or he could wear an eyepatch like you, milady. Or maybe a
mask…"</p><p><i>Rin… I told Rin to
give my eye to Kakashi. I guess she did. But… why am I alive?</i></p><p>"Is he ready to move
yet?"</p><p>"No, no. It will be
several weeks before that, but I'm sure you could find a room in
town."</p><p>"I'm afraid I can't
linger. Here, take this," I heard the rustling of money changing
hands "and look after him. I'll return as soon as I can and pay
the remainder of the cost" I heard footsteps stride over to me.
"Boy, are you awake?"</p><p>"Y-yes. Who are
you?"</p><p>"I am Machigai. What
is your name?"</p><p>"Uchiha Obito."</p><p>"Obito. Then you
will be Tobi, now. Will you help me, Tobi?"</p><p>"You saved my life."</p><p>She smiled. "Indeed.
 So, Tobi, have you heard of Uchiha Madara?"</p><p>"What Uchiha hasn't?"</p><p>Her voice dropped down
to a whisper. "You'll never believe this, but he's still
alive. I… work for him. He needs you to serve as his mouth in an
organisation that he is founding. Will you help him with that,
Tobi?"</p><p>"Of course, milady."</p><p>"Good man, Tobi."
She flashed me a grin, then turned to leave. I caught a glimpse of a
swirling grey cloak, and I lifted my head a painful fraction of an
inch and turned it to watch her go. Halfway to the door, she turned
and looked back. "Check out your new arm and leg if you can, eh?"
 She turned again and swept out the door.</p><p>New arm and leg? So I
was right in assuming that the numbness of half my body meant that I
had lost it. But new arm and leg? I'd never heard of such a
thing.</p><p>A friendly looking
nurse appeared at my side. "It's okay to try our your new arm,
at least. In fact, you probably should, to get your nerves
accustomed to the new connections."</p><p>I tried to lift my
right arm, and, despite the lack of feeling, a hand appeared before
my face, skillfully crafted of metal and plastic. I thought: <i>move
fingers</i>, and the finger of the hand waved through the air in
front of me. Yet, tapping the new hand lightly against the bedframe,
I felt nothing.</p><p>"It's an
experimental model, but it should guarantee your mobility. What do
you think?"</p><p>I grinned. "I like
it."</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade><u><b>Nagato</b></u></p><p>As every night, I lay
in bed, Konan held protectively in my arms, unable to sleep. I
traced cracks in the ceiling with my eyes, and listened to Yahiko
snore in the other room. And, always, my attention came back to the
girl I held. I gently stroked her soft blue hair, and she murmured
something in her sleep. Smiling softly, I brushed my lips against
her forehead. Knowing Konan, one would have thought that she could
be no more sweet and peaceful by night as during the day, but slumber
further softened her expression, and the childlike trust of relying
on me entirely was beautifully profound.</p><p>My eyelids gradually
closed, and I was nearly asleep when a sound startled me.</p><p>"Fuuma Nagato!"</p><p>Snatching up a kunai
from beneath my pillow, I pulled Konan closer, shielding her with my
arms. "Who's there?" I hissed.</p><p>"Someone who wishes
to treat with you. Come with me quietly, and I will leave the girl
and the other boy alone."</p><p>I snarled softly,
wishing that I had more than one kunai with me. I couldn't risk
throwing the one I had for fear of losing my only weapon. I assessed
my options for a moment, and realised that I had no choice but to do
what the stranger asked and hope that he would honor his promise and
not harm the others. Gently slipping Konan out of my arms, I climbed
out of bed and pulled on my shirt. Calling myself a thousand kinds
of idiot and swearing to always sleep well-armed in the future, I
clambered out the window, landing lightly in the garden below. A
shadowy figure beckoned to me, and I followed it deeper into the
bushes, away from the house.</p><p>"Fuuma Nagato." We
stopped and the figure spoke again. "You seek power?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"To defend Konan and
Yahiko, the ones you saw in there."</p><p>A flash of moonlight
illuminated an eerily grinning mouth of white teeth. "All that you
desire, I can grant you. Strength, power, everything. Follow me,
and you shall have it."</p><p>My brow furrowed as I
was struck by his statement. With power, I could do more than just
defend my friends; I could restore my village to its' former glory
and overthrow injustice. Stop pain in the world.</p><p>"Who are you?" I
asked.</p><p>He grinned again.
"Uchiha Madara."</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P><U><B>Minato</B></U></p><P>How wonderful that time
was, when Kushina and I were together, when our days were counted not
by hours or minutes, but by secret kisses and the times we snuck off
to my room. How wonderful, how glorious that time of flirtatious
whispers and sweet caresses. And not only love, but achievements
marked that time. She mastered the rasengan, and I celebrated. I
became Hokage, and she celebrated. But all good things must come to
an end. How wonderful it was, but how short a time before Kushina
told me that she was pregnant.</p><P>We had stolen away to
my flat, as was our habit, but she seemed subdued, less mischievous
than usual. When we got into the room, she pulled me close and
kissed me slowly, gently, but then she broke away and gave me a
small, sad smile.</p><P>"Minato… I am
bearing your child."</p><P>I drew in a gasp of
breath, then leaned down and kissed her in ecstasy. To have the
woman I loved give birth to my child was all that I could have ever
hoped for. I kissed her lovingly, but again she pulled away. To my
surprise, her eyes were wet with tears.</p><P>"Minato, I have
deceived you."</p><P>"What is it?" I
asked, my voice full of concern. She sank to the floor and I knelt
beside her.</p><P>"Have you ever heard
of Kyuubi no Yoko?" she questioned abruptly.</p><P>"Sure, that's one
of the bijuu, right? It's been destroying a lot of towns near here
in the past fifteen, twenty years."</p><P>She smirked bitterly. 
"I know a bit more about the kyuubi than most. Did you know that
the bijuu are daughters of the god Uchiwa and his nine animal
consorts?"</p><P>"Daughters? I
thought that they were male."</p><P>She smirked again. 
"Yes, daughters. And the kyuubi, because of her kitsune side, has
certain… fox-like abilities."</p><P>"The gift of
transformation?" I guessed.</p><P>"Yes. She takes many
forms." She paused, as if bracing herself, then spread her
delicate hands, gesturing to indicate her own body. "This is one
of them."</p><P>I blinked at her in
shock, unable—no, unwilling—to accept what she was saying.</p><P>"Minato, I am Kyuubi
no Yoko."</p><P>"No." I grabbed
her wrists and held them in my hand, as if that would stop her hands
from incriminating her. "No. You can't be. It's—it's
impossible."</p><P>"It isn't." She
blinked hard as tears welled up in her clear blue eyes. "I am the
kyuubi; I always have been."</p><P>And, finally, I began
to believe her. The trusting part of me still denied its
possibility, but the logical side screamed that it was true; that the
one I loved most in the world had deceived me. I dropped her wrists
as if they burnt me and backed across the room.</p><P>"Minato…" She
reached out to me with her lily hand, but I pushed it away.</p><P>"Stay away from me,
monster!"</p><P>"Minato!" The
tears now fell freely down her cheeks as she wept unashamedly. 
"Minato, I love you. I may have lied about other things, but that
was never—<I>never</I>—a lie." She reached out again for my
hand. "I thought you loved me, too."</p><P>"I loved Uzumaki
Kushina," I snarled. "But she was never anything but a lie."</p><P>She recoiled as if
slapped, and then her face transformed to one of anger. Orange
chakra bubbled over her body, taking the form of a fox. Terrified, I
backed as far towards the wall as I could, upsetting my desk. Papers
drifting towards her were incinerated by the restless chakra.</p><P>Then something
extraordinary happened. With a determined, almost angelic
expression, she clenched her two hands together and pressed them to
her chest. Gradually, the chakra diminished, drawing back into her
human body. Exhausted, Kushina had only enough strength to gasp my
name before she collapsed to the floor.</p><P>Despite my fear, I ran
to her side and knelt. She smiled up at me weakly. "Uzumaki
Kushina may have started as a lie, but she is now who I am. I
haven't been Kyuubi for the past fourteen years. I have been human
since… the day… I first…" As her eyelids fluttered shut, she
breathed two last words. "…Loved you…"</p><P><U><B>Kushina</B></U></p><P>When I awoke, the first
thing I saw was two startlingly blue eyes peering at me with concern.
 In a moment, I knew that I was on Minato's bed—the feeling of
his mattress against my back was one that I knew well.</p><P>"Minato." The
corners of my mouth lifted slightly. "You didn't run away."<p></p><P>He leaned in and gently
pressed his lips to mine. "Why would I run from you, Ku?" he
whispered, affectionately reverting to my childhood nickname.</p><P>I brought my hand to my
midriff and placed it tenderly above my womb. "The baby survived,"
I sighed. "I retained enough control to keep my chakra away from
it." I clenched my teeth and gathered myself. "Minato, kill
me."</p><P>"What?" He looked
aghast.</p><P>My voice was pleading. 
"I can only hold this form for maybe two, two-and-a-half months. 
Since the child is a quarter demon, he will grow quickly, but still,
I may not be strong enough. And, even if I am, I'm sure to
transform as soon as I give birth. When I do, I will destroy Konoha
and kill everyone in it. I don't want to, but with the
transformation comes a total lack of control. You must kill me now,
Hokage-sama. It is the only way to save your village."<p></p><P>"No." He looked
determined, yet as if he were internally arguing with himself. "I
refuse."</p><P>"Then promise me,
Minato." My desperation was evident, I was sure. "Promise me
that you won't let me hurt anyone."</p><P>He gripped my hand
reassuringly. "It is my duty to my village and to you. I will not
forget it."</p><P><U><B>Minato</B></U></p><P>I was in a meeting with
the council, debating a new law, when a young kunoichi rushed into
the room and tapped my shoulder nervously.</p><P>"I'm sorry to
disturb you, Hokage-sama, but Kushina-san sent me for you to say that
the baby's coming."</p><P>"What?" I
overturned my water glass onto a pile of official documents and
hastily righted it, trying to soak up the water with the hem of my
coat. The girl tugged anxiously at my sleeve.</p><P>"She says to hurry!"</p><P>"Right." I ran
halfway to the door, spun around to bow to the council, then zipped
out. In a matter of seconds, I was at Kushina's apartment
building. Strangely, she lay in the flowerbed.</p><P>"I fell out of the
window," she muttered by way of explanation. "But I'm
alright." I scooped her up in my arms. "Hey," she
interjected. "I can walk."</p><P>"We've go to
hurry," I hissed. "Do your best to hold your chakra in."</p><P>She nodded,
determinedly, but tiredly. Kushina had not been able to sleep for
the past four days, for fear that she wouldn't be able to hold her
form while she slept.</p><P>I flew along the
streets, rushing around familiar corners until I reached
Jiraiya-sensei's house at the edge of town. Setting Kushina gently
down by the front door, I dashed inside. Jiraiya was at the
cluttered kitchen table, drinking saké and writing with a
brush pen.</p><P>"Sensei! I need the
toad scroll!"</p><P>"Wha—?" He
looked up distractedly. "What do you need that for?"</p><P>I paused a moment. As
urgent as it was that I hurry, the village needed to be warned. 
"Jiraiya-sensei… the kyuubi is coming. Evacuate the city, and
muster all able ninja to… the west."</p><P>In an instant, I had
his complete attention and he was tying on his battered hitai-ate as
he spoke. "What of the Academy students? They'll want to
fight."</p><P>"No. Have the eldest
of them lead the younger children up to the shelters so that the
teachers can defend the city. And have the rookie genin supervise
the evacuation of civilians. I want no unnecessary bloodshed."</p><P>Removing the toad
scroll from its hiding place, Jiraiya handed it to me. "And you?"</p><P>I strapped the large
scroll to my back and grinned bitterly. "I'm going to meet it."</p><P>"Minato." My
teacher grabbed my arm. "I know what you're thinking, and I
agree that it needs to be done. But you're young, and you're a
great Hokage. Let someone else seal the kyuubi. Let—let me do
it!"</p><P>Kushina let out a soft
moan from outside, and I turned to the door, shaking off his
protective hand. "No. It has to be me."</p><P>"Minato!" Jiraiya
sensei called, but I was already out of his house, my love in my
arms, running as far away from Konoha as I could. Orange chakra was
beginning to seep from Kushina's body, but she valiantly held it
in, contorting her face as her body was wracked by contractions.</p><P>"Don't worry," I
whispered into her hair. "Everything is going to be alright."</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><p><u><b>Jiraiya</b></u></p><p>The field was strewn
with the dead and the dying. From all around me came cries of pain
and loss. The ground drank greedily, gorging itself on the blood of
the fallen. Somewhere in the night, a dying ninken let out its last
howl of mortal pain. Even the moon appeared to glow red, as if
reflecting the carnage on the ground.</p><p>But in the midst of
this macabre scene, one thing drew my attention. Minato's body lay
alone, broken by its fall from Gamabunta's back, the empty shell of
what had been my student. He had fallen nobly.</p><p>In the days that
followed, we would never find Kushina. It was assumed that she was
among the innumerable dead mangled beyond recognition. But Minato's
corpse was untouched; it might have been alive, but for the odd
position of its broken limbs. It was as if the kyuubi wanted to
cause us this one last grief—to see our beloved Hokage dead, to
know that it was him, and that his spirit had left us.</p><p>A great, keening cry
arose from those around me at the sight of his lifeless body, and
many came close, trying to draw some slight comfort from each other
as they gazed down on their fallen leader. Many hovered a few metres
away, as if afraid to draw too near, but one pale-eyed man strode
forward and snatched up the babe whose fall had been broken by
Minato's protective embrace. He, like I, saw the seal on the
infant's abdomen, and knew well what it meant.</p><p>"Let us kill it now,"
he hissed, drawing a kunai. "Let us be rid of it before it can
bring us more misery!"</p><p>He raised the kunai and
made as if to plunge it into the baby's small chest, but before
even I could move, the young jounin Kakashi had seized the man's
wrist, squeezing it so that the weapon dropped from his hand.</p><p>"I think,
Hanazawa-san," he said, gazing upon the body of his teacher and
friend "that we have had enough of killing tonight."</p><p>The man turned his head
away. "I apologise, Kakashi-taijou. You are right." Shoving
the child into Kakashi's arms, he pressed his way through the
crowd.</p><p>"Jiraiya-sama."
Kakashi held the babe out to me. "Perhaps you should take him?"</p><p>I took the infant into
my arms. He was squalling loudly now, as if he could sense the grief
in the air. I rocked him gently, and he ceased his crying and opened
his eyes. They were a bright, alert blue, so like his parents'
that I had to blink back tears.</p><p>"Jiraiya-sama." A
female medic ninja touched my elbow. "You're wounded."</p><p>"It's nothing," I
said. "Go help Tsunade—others out there need your help more than
I."</p><p>As she turned to go,
the girl looked back at the baby I still held. "What—what will
you name him, sir?"</p><p>I remembered the name
Kushina and Minato had picked for this baby. I had thought of it,
actually, just a random name I picked while eating ramen. But now…
now I realised that it was perfect. It was a strange name, a wind
and water name. Like his mother's. Like his father's. And
somehow, it is just right for him.</p><p>"Sir?"</p><p>"I think…" I said
slowly. "I think that we will call him Naruto."</p><p><i>The End</i></p>
