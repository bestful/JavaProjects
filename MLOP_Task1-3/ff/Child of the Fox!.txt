beauty as well!He blushed a bit.</p><p>He remained quiet and tried to get off the bed but woke the woman in the process.</p><p>"Where are you going,Naruto-kun?"</p><p>"…Who are you and how do you know my name?"</p><p>"….Uhh…well Naruto..would you believe me if I said that I was your mommy?"</p><p>"No.I don't have a Mommy."Said Naruto putting on a sad face.</p><p>"Well now you do since I am going to be your Mommy!"</p><p>"Really?"Naruto looked up at her with hope gleaming in his deep blue eyes.</p><p>"Yes!Now..Come here!We need to get have a meeting with the Hokage!"</p><p>"Okay…But..Do you have a name,Mommy?"</p><p>"Yes..It is Kurama but I would rather that you call me mother or Mommy."</p><p>"Sure,Mommy!"All the sadness gone from his face,Naruto ran to his new Mother and got dressed.</p><p>When they came out to the street she led him by the hand towards the Hokage's office.</p><p>Naruto noticed how people were staring at them..Something he was used to..but..they were not staring at him but his new Mother.</p><p>Her flaming red Hair,long legs and perfect figure attracted a lot of both genders..even kids were staring at she did not pay mind to the stares and simply continued along the road..Then a guy approached..</p><p>One could smell that he was a big time womanizer and probably had it stuck in his head that he could have every girl in the village.</p><p>"Hey there,sexy!Why don't you leave that demon filth alone and come have some fun with me?"</p><p>Kurama's eyes flared red from anger.</p><p>"<b>What…Did..you…just..call..My..Son?"</b></p><p>The playboy was so scared that he fell down on his butt,making Naruto chuckle a bit but he himself couldn't help but feeling a bit scared of his mommy.</p><p>"..Nothing at all,miss!He is a beautifull little boy is what I was saying!"</p><p>Kurama then smiled,making the people around her have their hearth flutter..completely forgetting how she called Naruto her son.</p><p>"Good..Now get lost before i decide to deprive you of your manhood."</p><p>The guy just nodded and ran for dear people around them were all laughing madly.</p><p>"Now then,shall we continue our journey,dear?"</p><p>"Yeah!"</p><p>"Alright."Kurama then took the little Naruto into her arms,making him blush a bit,</p><p><i>SOMETIME LATER – The Council Room!</i></p><p>They entered a huge sphere shaped was filled with took note of how on one side there was a lot of shinobi and on the other were the village elders and civilians.</p><p>"Ahh,Kurama you are finally here..Please take a seat."Sarutobi said while pointing at a seat next to did as she was sat on the seat with little Naruto now slowly falling asleep on her lap.</p><p>"Now lets begin shall we."</p><p>Just then a shinobi rose up.</p><p>"First of all..What is the point of this meeting?Second of all..Who is that Woman, Hokage-sama?"</p><p>"Sit down,I was just going to explain."</p><p>"The woman who is here sitting next to me is Kurama..But to us..She is more known as The Kyuubi,or the Nine tailed Fox."</p><p>All of the council."WHAT?"</p><p>Kurama,while covering her ears,yelled."Would you please lower your voices!I don't want to deprive my son of more precious sleep!"</p><p>"Ahh,sorry….Wait…Your what?"Said a random civilian looking at Naruto and Kurama.</p><p>Sarutobi looked at nodded.</p><p>"Alright..I want peace and order to be maintained here while I explain what actually happened that day when Naruto was born…And how wrong our assumptions were."All the people in the room quieted when they heard Sarutobis serious tone.</p><p>He then started to tell them all about last night and what actually happened during the day Kyuubi ,or now known as Kurama ,attack their village..Afther he finished the story one of the elders fell down ..Supposedly later he began talking.</p><p>"I…Oh..my god….I don't…no….I'm so sorry…"</p><p>"Don't worry..It isn't your fault,you had no already forgave you."</p><p>"What?Why?What did you do,Jiruka?"</p><p>"It was me…I planned Naruto's beatings…I was the one behind..Because I was angry…I don't…I am so sorry.."</p><p>He then stood up."If there is anything that you need..Any kind of help then please tell me.I will be more than glad to help you two."</p><p>"Thank you.I will certanly need some help with raising Naruto."Said Kurama with a smile on her face which shocked them all.</p><p>"Raising Naruto?"</p><p>Sarutobi seems to have forgotten to say that she already accepted a deal with him.</p><p>"Yes,Kurama-sama intends to raise Naruto in the village and she has my is no longer her Jinchuriki he needs to have at least a chance of a normal anyone of you have problems with that?"</p><p>No one said anything but they all tensed thinking of living near the Kyuubi.</p><p>"Don't worry…I don't plan on going on mission's but I will train Naruto myself and also let him go to the ninja Academy .He is my son he does posses some demonic powers as well as his human powers..rather than a Jinchiruki…Naruto is something more alike to a Human Biju…He will need my training if he ever wished to use his powers but don't worry,since his powers are his own,he will be able to control them perfectly with little to no effort,I will also protect the Village should an enemy attack it directly.I hope that is enaugh for you all."</p><p>The councill members discussed this for a moment and then gave their reply.</p><p>" We agree with your proposal."</p><p>"Good then that is settled!Dismissed!"</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>AFTER EVERYONE LEFT – Sarutobi stopped Kurama who was gently holding Naruto in her hands.</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"I forgot to ask..How old is Naruto now?"</p><p>"He is five,why?"</p><p>"Oh..Then he will need to wait three more years before entering the Academy."</p><p>"Three years?Perfect amount of time to let the dust settle down and the adults start to respect him some."</p><p>"Agreed."</p><hr size=1

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p><i><b>Nexus : Hello,everyone!Hope you liked the last chapter as much as I did!..Yes I read my own stories when i can't find anything better to do and I think I did pretty good!</b></i></p><p><i><b>But enaught of my chatter!Lets get on with the story!</b></i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>CHAPTER BEGIN – Timeskip Warning!- This is FOUR years after the last chapter!</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Four year's have passed faster than anyone would have thought or wanted them to.</p><p>But it was more than enaught time for the people in Konoha to accept and respect Naruto and his Mother,who decided to reforge their names into talked to Kurama about this and she accepted the surname *Kitsune*.</p><p>Now she and her son were Naruto and Kurama Kitsune. This has,for some reason,made it a lot easier for the both of them to be accepted into the because the people who didn't know the truth behind the two thought that their strange animalistic appearances and powers came from their also unusual bloodline.</p><p>In time,Kurama learned the hardships of being a mother and also the good sides to raising a child. The happiness when you get to teach them something and they renember it,for longer than two weeks!</p><p>Today was a shopping day for Kurama. She never paid any mind to the stares most of the men in the village were giving her but it always gave her an unpleasant feeling. Every few days another idiot would find the courage to try and hit on her,only to fail and have their manhood threatened in front of an ever growing public.</p><p>She finally got to the Market and greeted the lady at the grocery store.</p><p>"Hello there ,Lira-san!"</p><p>"Oh,Kurama-sama!Came to pay me a visit or is it a shopping day for you?"</p><p>"I would say both but unfortunately i don't have much time as my son is already whining at home because hes hungry!So I came here to shop."</p><p>"Heh,I expected something of the like. Will it be the usual amount,Kurama-sama?"</p><p>"Yes,please!"</p><p>Kurama waltzed out the market after she was done couldn't wait to begin cooking breakfast for her and her Naruto!He was now nine years old and he had also passed the was the day when he would be assinged to a asked if she wanted to chose who would teach him and she answered him that his main teacher will always be her and that the other one he can chose himself .He agreed with her.</p><p>She also found out how she had a talent for cooking and opened a had a restourant with strange name and children would often ask why she named it as such.A Kitsune's ..That's its name..Naruto as well often questioned his mother why she named it as such even thought he knew of her true identity ..</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>Now a little something about Naruto.</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>KITSUNE FAMILY HOUSE – It isn't a big a normal med-eval Japanese stryled house with a big garden which was split in part which were the training grounds and the other being an actual one of Kuramas to the house was another,much larger building,which as you can probably guess..was the restourant –A Kitsune's Cookpot!-.</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto was getting impatient waiting for his mother to come had nothing else to do but wait for he decided to practice some jutsu in order to waste time.</p><p>He got out to the training grounds and started taught him Rasengan but he had not yet perfected also renembered to try and call out more of his demon powers or his seemed to be a Black Fox,while his mother was an Orange one. His demon form was alike his human one except that his hair changes to black and actual tails grow from behind him. He also grows two black fox ears on him when he changes,which he hates because the women who saw his demon form called him cute because of it..</p><p>As he was practicing his jutsu he did not notice his mother come back wanted to greet him but instead she just went to cook knowing what he would want to eat.</p><p><i>AFTER AROUND THIRTY MINUTES LATER</i></p><p>"Narutoooo!Come!Breakfast is ready!"</p><p>"Uh huh?When did you come back?"</p><p>"About half an hour ago!"</p><p>"No way!I didn't even notice!"</p><p>Kurama just smiled at him and Naruto came rushing nose picked up the scent of his meal and he instantly perked up!</p><p>"RAMEEEN!"</p><p>A chuckle could be heard from behind him but he was too engrossed in his food to notice.</p><p>Kurama on the other hand just made herself some she finished drinking it he kissed her son's forehead causing him to fume. She then went to work,leaving Naruto alone.</p><p>It was ten o' clock right now so he packed his stuff up and went to the Academy,eager to find out who will he be teamed up had hoped that he would be together with Aki,who was the best female rookie of the year and his best friend. They found themselves being alike to each other because of their animalistic appearances and quickly became best friends.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>THE CLASSROOM – I forgot to mention but I did not make Naruto the best of the is just below the best. He would be lower than the average student were it not for his mother's scary aura when she gets angry. He did have bad grades at the start but that quickly changed because of reasons already mentioned.</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Surprisingly,even to Naruto,he found out how he was the first one to arrive. He took a seat in the upper part of the classroom.</p><p>The second to come was Uchiha Sasuke. His utmost rival and hated enemy. He inwardly cursed the second he saw him.</p><p>"Oh,Surprise Surprise,The Joker was the first one to arrive."</p><p>"Where's the surprise?I am known to be an early-bird."</p><p>"No you aren't. You just don't want to waste the chance your mommy worked so hard to get.I wonder how many men she had to please to get you to pass the Academy!"Insulted Sasuke.</p><p>Naruto took the Bait. No one,and I mean no one!Talks about his mom that way!</p><p>Without another word said he charged Sasuke and slammed him to the then started to slam his fists into Sasuke's stomach so hard that the dark haired prick spat blood onto the floor. He couldn't react..at all!</p><p>Naruto would have killed him him if Iruka did not arrive when he did.</p><p>"Naruto,Stop it!What the hell are you doing?"</p><p>Naruto forcefully stopped hitting Sasuke and turned to Iruka.</p><p>"He insulted my Mother, said she was a whore."</p><p>Iruka stared at Sasuke and inwardly wanted Naruto to continue beating him but that was not a good idea.</p><p>"Sasuke,it would be in your best interest to apologise to Naruto."</p><p>"Like hell I,An Uchiha,Am going to apologise to this worthless,future less piece of shit."</p><p>At the end of the sentence,Naruto jumped into the air and performed a roundhouse kick,making Sasuke fly through the window of the classroom. Luckily for Sasuke,they were open. He fell on soft ground and stood up,only to find the rest of his class. Naruto appeared looking down from the window.</p><p>"The next fucking time you try to start a fight,try to do so when you're a lot might actually hit me."Said Naruto with a smile on his whole class sighed…They all had the same thought in mind *It's just another fight…*.</p><p>Without even looking at Iruka,Naruto returned to his seat with a grim look on his was once again the next to enter the was too scared to do anything to Naruto right now so he took a seat in the lowest level of the ,still being his fan girl,sat right next to him in order to provide some comfort.</p><p>Aki entered the room and looked around only to find Naruto waving at her. She knew where she would sit,that much was clear. She sat on the right side of Naruto. Soon after,the classroom was filled with all kinds of people.</p><p>"Now then,lets start arranging the teams."</p><p>Naruto didn't bother paying attention to the other own was the only one that mattered to him.</p><p>"Team 7 is Shino Aburame,Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno."Sakura could be heard squealing like the fan girl she is. Sasuke just grinned and Shino just did not say,or do for that matter,anything.</p><p>"Team 8 is Ino Yamanaka,Shikamaru Nara and Choji Akamichi."Ino muttered something under her breath. Shikamaru and Choji just did a high-five.</p><p>"Team 9 is Hyuga Hinata,Hyuga Neji and Tenten."No response.. as if it was intended.</p><p>"Team 10 is Naruto Kitsune,Aki Inuzuka and Kiba Inuzuka."Now this team was a surprise to everyone but then again it was also expected. Naruto and Aki just high-fived and Kiba came to sit close to them. He and Naruto were rivals but not like Naruto and Sasuke. They were friends,best friends if you asked Kiba. He was glad he gets to be with his cousin and best friend in the same team.</p><p>"Team 11 is Rock Lee,Lucy Ayame and Ryo Inuzuka."Lee was kinda sad he didn't get to be in the same team as Neji but he liked his new team. They were both his childhood friends and they already had some teamwork.</p><p>"Now that all teams are assinged you will all stay inside of the classroom and your new sensei will come to get you.I want you all to know that I am proud of all of you!I know you will make me even more proud by becoming the best shinobi and kunoichi Konoha has ever known!"</p><p>All the students,except for Sasuke and Sakura,cheered for their Sensei.</p><p><i>HALF AN HOUR LATER</i></p><p>"Alright,who is Team 10?"Asked Itachi.(Yeah,I know what you're all going to say but yes I decided to make it so that the Uchiha Slaughter never happened.)</p><p>"No way,Weasel-san?"Asked Naruto.</p><p>"Weasel?"</p><p>"Naruto,I am going to have to teach you not to give out my ANBU name so easily…"</p><p>"AAAAH!Sorry!I didn't mean to!"</p><p>"Nah,it's okay.I was planning on telling you three anyway.. Now please follow me.I need to test you for a bit."</p><p>"Another Test?Seriously?"Asked Kiba.</p><p>"Don't worry it's nothing too hard."He made that *hard* sound a bit more evil than needed.</p><p>The trio shivered and followed Itachi Silently.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>AN OPEN GRASSLAND AREA – If you want to imagine something with more detail then imagine the same place Kakashi trained his team…</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>They all sat on the grass and began talking.</p><p>"Alright then,How about we first introduce each other?"</p><p>"You first,sensei!"</p><p>"Hmm..Alright..My name is Itachi Uchiha,I dislike arrogant idiots who think they are above everything when they are actually Likes are spending time in Nature and Training…You are next Naruto."</p><p>"Alright so..My name is Naruto dislikes are the same as senseis.I also don't like perverts and I absolutely despise womanizers.I also hate it when people judge someone based upon their appearance . The things I like are Ramen,Talking to animals,doing all sorts of pranks and most of all,Annoying the old man,Hokage."</p><p>The three people laughed quite a bit after hearing that and then Naruto pointed at Aki,signaling that she was next.</p><p>"My name is Aki Inuzuka. My dislikes are the same as Naruto's.I like helping people out and playing hero but I also love spending my time helping Naruto annoy the Hokage which I also enjoy quite a bit."Said Aki with a smirk upon her face.</p><p>"My name is Kiba Inuzuka . My dislikes are people who think lowly of animals and I despise poachers and bandits..I pretty much hate people who do bad stuff. My likes are Ramen,sleeping on huge tree's and hunting for prey with my dog Akamaru."Said Kiba as he petted Akamaru who just barked happily in turn.</p><p>"Alright,now that were done with the Introductions how about we start the test!"</p><p>"Hell YEAH!"Yelled the three in unison.</p><p><i>CHAPTER END .</i></p><p><i><b>Nexus : Yeah I think it's okay to end it chapter is huuuge!I am already proud of it!</b></i></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p><i><b>Nexus : Hello there you all!Here's the next chapter!</b></i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>CHAPTER START</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"Alright you three!Get up,on your feet!"Signaled Itachi.</p><p>"Hai,Sensei!"</p><p>Then Itachi reached into his pockets and got out three papers. He gave one to each member of his team. The two two Inuzuka looked at him strangely , Naruto , on the other hand, already knew what to do.</p><p>"Erm..Sensei?What do we do with these pieces of Paper?"</p><p>"That's the test. You're going to have to figure it out on your own…Oh and Naruto?Keep your mouth shut!"</p><p>"Hai…"Said Naruto looking away.</p><p>"You know what we have to do,Naru-kun?"</p><p>"Yeah..I kinda did it once or twice with my mom."(Warning – Pervy Sentence)</p><p>"Ahhh,figures."</p><p>Naruto then ran to a nearby tree and sat on a branch while still holding the paper in his hand.</p><p>He focused on the paper now and fused it his chakra. It became pitch black and then it sliced itself into neat pieces.</p><p>He then jumped down from the tree and went to Itachi.</p><p>"Here sensei,I'm done."</p><p>"Hmmmm…Pitch black and sliced into two?Which happened first Naruto?"</p><p>"First it became all black and then it got ripped apart."</p><p>"Alright..You have your bloodline's Chaos Element alright…And you also have a second element which is the Wind Element…This is rare!For Konoha anyway."</p><p>"Chaos Element?"Asked Aki.</p><p>"Yes,the Kitsune clan is a clan which has a unique type of element and chakra."</p><p>The two Inuzuka renembered how Naruto's chakra was always black rather than blue.</p><p>"Yeah,my element is kinda like that of those Biju guys…"said Naruto sheepishly.</p><p>"Biju?The Tailed Beasts?"</p><p>"Yea,them."</p><p>"I guess that's the reason your chakra's all black and stuff?"</p><p>"Yup."</p><p>Then Kiba got an idea..Maybe he had to infuse the paper with his chakra?</p><p>He tested his metaphor and the paper burned in his hands,causing him to drop it hastily.</p><p>"What the HECK?"</p><p>"Oh my..Seems like you have a fire element!Good,it's going to make it easier for me to teach you this way."</p><p>"So I'm fire! Hmmm…Maybe I could mix my Gatsuga with fire?I wonder how that would look like?"</p><p>"We will see one day but don't try it now..You don't know how to bring out your elemental chakra and that might cause big problems."</p><p>It was Aki's turn to get the idea. She infused the paper with her own chakra and the paper got wet and then started to wrinkle away. It also gave her a light shock.</p><p>"Oh..So Aki has two elements!"</p><p>"I do?"</p><p>"Yes,you do and it's a perfect combination at that!You have lightning and water. This can prove to be quite a deadly combo at times."</p><p>"I rock!"Said Aki as she threw her arms into the air screaming Wooohoo!</p><p>"Good now that this part is taken care of how about we start the real test?"</p><p>"Hai!"Yelled the three in unison.</p><p>*Heh,I have a feeling I am going to get along with these three brats just fine…*thought Itachi.</p><p>"Do you see that hole over there?"</p><p>"That one?"Asked Aki while pointing her finger down.</p><p>"Yes ,that one!Go look what's inside!"</p><p>The trio walked near it.</p><p>"There's nothing inside,Sensei?"</p><p>Itachi got near them and then kicked the three kids inside of the hole.</p><p>Luckily,they all fell on their butts.</p><p>"Owwwwww..What was that for,Sensei?"</p><p>"I have nothing against you three,I assure you…This is the test..You need to get out of that hole..I will give you two hints! Chakra and Feet…You have two hours to get out and considering that right now its 12 AM you have un till 2PM."</p><p>"Grrr…Fine.."said Kiba.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>ONE HOUR LATER…..</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"Shit!We aren't ever going to get out of this damned Hell hole!"whined Kiba.</p><p>"Hey,lets just stop for a minute okay?I have an idea!"Said Aki.</p><p>"Then share it already.."Said Naruto.</p><p>"Sensei said something about chakra and feet,right?So maybe we just have to put chakra into our feet?"</p><p>"Hmm..Let me try."Said Kiba.</p><p>He ran up the hole and got to half its size and then fell ..Good thing that Naruto caught him.</p><p>"Yeah,that's what we have to do…But it isn't as easy as it seems!"</p><p>"This is about chakra control,isn't it?"said Naruto.</p><p>"Seems to be like it."</p><p>"Then let me try!"Said Naruto as he ran up the hole and then when he was nearly at the top he stopped and jumped out.</p><p>"You did it!"</p><p>"Yeah!Look the things you need to do is not just imagine chakra at you're feet but imagine like you're climbing a mountain that's easy to climb and close your eyes while you're at it.</p><p>"My turn!"said Aki as she ran up the hole. She was close but she missed a step and fell only to be caught by Kiba,bridal style,who then jumped out the same way as Naruto.</p><p>"Thanks, Kiba-kun!"</p><p>"Nah,no problem."</p><p>"I am glad that you two got out…but where's Itachi-sensei?"</p><p>"Over there."Pointed Kiba.</p><p>They all looked in the same direction and found their sensei sleeping below a tree. The trio had evil smirks on their faces.</p><p>"Hey,guys..I have an idea!Let's get him back for what he's done!..Any ideas?"</p><p>"Didn't you just say that you had one?"</p><p>"Uhmmm…"</p><p>"Heh.I got one!"said Naruto.</p><p>"Spill!"</p><p>"Let's fart in his face!"</p><p>"Good one!"said Kiba.</p><p>"Uhhh…I don't think I should participate."</p><p>"Then what do you propose we do,Aki-chan?"Asked Naruto.</p><p>"Nah,you two go fart in his face while I am going to shriek him awake."</p><p>"Yeah,that sound's good..Let's go!"</p><p>So they did…Naruto and Kiba *posistioned* themselves and so did Aki.</p><p>"Now!"</p><p>"SCHREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECH!"</p><p>Then first two farts could be heard…Loudly..</p><p>"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHWTFOMGFTH!"Itachi screamed and quickly pinched his nose but it was too late and he fainted…When he finally got out of his trance he found the three brats in his team all laughing hard on the forest floor.</p><p>"What the hell,you three?That was not funny at all…"He cursed inwardly.</p><p>"We had to get you back somehow!"</p><p>"Yeah,and you have to admit!It was awesome!"</p><p>"Tsk..fine fine..but don't do it again,you hear me?Now i can see you got out of the hole..So tell me how did you do it?"</p><p>"We infused chakra into our feet and climbed upwards.."Said Naruto.</p><p>Itachi was surprised..He thought that the two Inuzuka would use their powers in order to dig them out.</p><p>"Good job,you go and get some rest…We will get our first mission tomorrow.I think you are ready for that much."</p><p>"Yeeey!"the trio high-fived!</p><p>And then they all separated and went their own ways..Itachi smirked.*Yeah…I am going to get along with these kids just fine..I just have to renember not to sleep anywhere near them in the future…*He shivered and then got up,wandering how he should spent the rest of this beautiful day.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>CHAPTER END</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i><b>Nexus : This is where I am gonna end the chapter.I think that this one is kind of short..but never mind..Oh and if you think that I made the fact that the trio were still kids too obvious then that's alright because that was the goal of this chapter…Well that and their elemental chakra's and some degree of you soon!And please review!</b></i></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><p><i><b>Nexus : Helyo everybody!Here comes the next chapter!</b></i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>CHAPTER START</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto woke up in his room.(Same as his apartment except it's part of a bigger house).</p><p>He quickly got dressed up and went downstairs.</p><p>As he expected,his mother was already in the kitchen.</p><p>"Hey Mom!What's for breakfast?"</p><p>"What?No Good Morning Mom?Meh,no breakfast for you!"Teased Kurama.</p><p>"What?NUUUUUUU!I'M SORRY!"</p><p>"Hehe,apology accepted!So what do you want to have for breakfast,Naruto?"</p><p>"I want Ram-"</p><p>Kurama quickly covered his mouth with her hand.</p><p>"No Ramen for you young mister!You have to start eating healthier foods!"</p><p>"Damn…. Well then how about some Ham and Green Eggs?"</p><p>"That will do!"Said Kurama as she visibly brightened up and turned around to continue cooking.</p><p>Naruto sat down on the couch and started lazing around, waiting for his Mother to finish making breakfast.</p><p>Suddenly there was someone knocking on the door. Naruto instantly got up and said.</p><p>"I'll get it!"</p><p>"Okay!"</p><p>He then opened the door only to see an AMBU ninja he recognized..It was Snake but he knew her name.</p><p>"Anko!"</p><p>"Hey,there little gaki!Is your mother home?"</p><p>"Yeah!Just give me a sec!"</p><p>Naruto turned around.</p><p>"Hey,Mom!Anko-onechan is here to see you!"</p><p>"I'm coming!"(Warning – Pervy Sentence!)</p><p>Kurama came to the door and saw Anko's face turn serious for a moment. She nodded in understanding.</p><p>"Hey,Naru-kun…Your breakfast is waiting for you in the go eat it quick before it gets cold!"</p><p>"Okay mom!"Said a happy Naruto as he ran off to the Kitchen.</p><p>Once he was out of sight, Kurama waved for Anko to follow ended up inside of Kurama's office. It looked a lot like the Hokage's office…except it didn't have the same view over the village. Soon after,Kurama began.</p><p>"So then..What's wrong?"</p><p>"Here."Said Anko as she handed Kurama a letter. It said Sarutobi on the front and had the Hokage's seal on it. She also noted that there was a chakra trace around the note.</p><p>She then opened a window and took a leaf off a nearby then infused it with her chakra and placed it on the letter which made it open.</p><p>The note said :</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>Dear Kurama</i></p><p><i>Here I am,calling for you,the very Nine-Tailed Fox that forcefully attacked our village so many year's ago…I want to inform you that we, have found an organization created out of missing ninja and they all have black cloaks with red clouds on them. We have not ,however seen anyone of them to posses an Orange Mask but considering the fact that he could control you…I guess he could ,in fact, be their leader..The organization's name is Akatsuki. This is all that I am going to write down in the letter but I have more information to give you.</i></p><p><i>Oh and also,there is something that i want to ask you so please pay me a visit as soon as you can.<br></i></p><p><i>From,Sarutobi.</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>She read the letter twice and then burned it to nothingness with her chakra.</p><p>"Alright..seems like I have to visit the old man soon..Anything else you want to tell me?"</p><p>"No that is all Kurama-sama."</p><p>"Then you can go and report to the Hokage."</p><p>"Actually..there is one more thing."</p><p>"Do tell."</p><p>Anko took a deep breath.</p><p>"Would you want to..Become Hokage?"</p><p>Kurama just stared at her with more than just wide eyes for quite some time and then answered.</p><p>"Are you seriously asking me that?Wouldn't Jiraja or Tsunade be a better choice?"</p><p>"Neither of them wants to be Hokage,Kurama-sama and besides..someone as powerful as you would me more than just the perfect do consider this…And This is not just me asking you,my lady..The whole council would love to have you as Hokage."</p><p>"The WHOLE council?"Asked Kurama with a smirk upon her face.</p><p>"Well,except maybe two old farts but never mind them."</p><p>"I see..Well then..Maybe I will consider it.. It does go well with my promise to the Village. Anything else you want to add?"</p><p>"No,nothing else,Kurama-sama!"Said Anko and then left.</p><p>Kurama threw herself into her chair. She sighed…More work was coming her way..that is..if she accepts becoming Hokage.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>MEANWHILE</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>*Mom and Anko aren't coming back down…I guess it's something important..Maybe I should go eavesdrop…*</p><p>Just then the clock looked around…He saw that it was 10 AM…*shit I'm late*..</p><p>*Damnit!Oh well better finish eating and run.*</p><p>And so he did.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>IN THE HOKAGE'S OFFICE</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto just barged inside without even knocking.</p><p>"Sorry I'm LATE!"He screamed and then bumped into someone. It was Konohamaru who then fell on his butt.</p><p>"Owwww..What the hell was that for,boss?"</p><p>"Ahh Konohamaru?Sorry…here."Naruto said giving him his hand.</p><p>Konohamaru took it and got up and then left the room hastily. Naruto noticed how he looked quite annoyed and angry.</p><p>He then turned to find his team and sensei.</p><p>"Ummmm..Did I miss something?"</p><p>"No not really..Me and Konohamaru just had a spat,no big deal..Oh and Naruto,did you Mother get the letter I sent her?"</p><p>"I don't renember any lett-AH!Was that the reason Snake-Oneesan came to visit?"</p><p>"Anko did?"Asked Itachi.</p><p>"Yes,she did..Good that means my letter was safely delivered. Now then,let's see what kind of Mission should I send you to."</p><p>Sarutobi then rummaged through lots of Paperwork and found something that would fit genin level ninja.</p><p>He found something.</p><p>"Alright here's a few missions for you and your team,Itachi."</p><p>He took the few papers from the Hokage's we four C rank missions and one D ranked.</p><p>"Alright,this should do. Lets go team, we have work to do."</p><p>"Yoshi!"</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>OUTSIDE OF THE VILLAGE</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto and the team went from hunting for cats,catching crime doers,picking up litter to helping old people do daily activities. They all wanted a challenge and these missions didn't exactly prove that challenging.</p><p>Itachi saw the frowns on their faces and smiled.</p><p>"That's what you get for being Genin…But don't worry..We have a higher level mission ahead of us."</p><p>The trio instantly cheered up</p><p>They left for a town really close to Konoha . It was where their mission lead them.</p><p>When they came to the town they saw it full of bandits,thieves and the rest of their crime doing brethren…. They hid in some bushes and waited for orders.</p><p>"Alright team,listen place is full of is weak scum but lots of scum tends to get dangerous..even for people of my level."</p><p>"So this will be a test of teamwork..Naruto will be the front because he has the most fighting power, Aki you will be in the middle because you know some defensive jutsu which will be most useful. Kiba you will take the backside and protect the team from attacks from behind. You will be allowed to remove yourselves from this formation should the situation require it…Now go and kill some bandits!"</p><p>"Yes,Sensei!"The trio attacked leaving Itachi then went for the Crime lord occupying the city.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>THE TRIO'S POV</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>They barged in,taking out dozens of bandits and they continued beating them until three weird bandits came out.</p><p>"Stop right there,you brats!We,the famous Killer-Jack Brothers,will rip you apart!"</p><p>And there they were..One a brute,one skinny but fast and another normal size wielding a huge sword.</p><p>"Naru-kun you take the big guy,Kiba-kun you go against the big sword dude and i'll take the skinny one."</p><p>"Alright!"Naruto and Kiba yelled in unison.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>NARUTO TIME</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto charged the big dude. He had a huge Morning Star behind him. He picked it up with some effort and smashed it on the ground.</p><p>Naruto evaded the hit and went for the guys stomach,only to get hit with a fist to the stomach.</p><p>The force of the punch sent him flying into the nearby wall..He recovered quickly and let the brute attack first this time..One again he evaded a hit and went for the stomach but this time he made two incomplete <b>Rasengan</b> in his palms. The brute tried to hit him again but felt his whole arm being ripped apart by the Jutsu. It ate through his arm and made a hole in the Brute's stomach,effectively ending the fight.</p><p>Naruto then just fell down unmoving.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>KIBA TIME</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Kiba charged the guy like a wild animal and hit him in the stomach. The guy fell down from the hit but quickly got up and slashed his sword.</p><p>Kiba barely avoided it and then he got below the guy and used a <b>Gatsuga.</b>The bandit was out cold from the damage. Kiba just smirked.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>AKI TIME</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The Skinny guy was fast..very fast..he used two claws as weapons and was doing a good job of cutting Aki up. She managed to kick him off his feet and then proceded to pound his face.</p><p>She then renembered their test with Itachi-sensei and tried to draw out her elemental chakra.</p><p>This time only lighting came out but that was exactly what she wanted. She inwardly named it <b>Lightning Style : Shock Fist </b>in her head and then punched the bandit once more. The jutsu was powerful enaught to make the bandits head explode.</p><p>This also made the men around her shit their pants and run away.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>READER POV</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Itachi then came back with the head of the Crime lord sealed into a scroll.</p><p>He saw his team and realized they were done killing the bandits.</p><p>He gathered the team and they silently went back to Konoha..still a little dazed because of the fact they just murdered somebody..even if that person was nothing more than a lowlife.</p><p>Itachi was quiet..He let his team figure it out on their own. This was best for them that they learned the feeling of murder early on..It would help them with missions like this later…but he couldn't help but feel a little guilty for not rejecting the D-rank mission when he saw it..Maybe..just Maybe…it was too early in their Ninja lives to experience this…</p><p>But what's done is done..No use crying over spilt milk..or so he kept telling himself over and over…</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>CHAPTER END</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i><b>Nexus : I don't have much to say right now..Even I feel it was too early for the trio of kids to murder someone..They're only Eight years old!But never mind that.</b></i></p><p><i><b>And Kurama as Hokage?I can't believe I got such an Awesome IDEA pop in my head!</b></i></p><p><i><b>I bet I am the first to do that!Making Kurama a Hokage..I will be the first person in all of fanfiction to do something like that!If i am not then tell me..by reviewing!XD</b></i></p>

Kurama noticed something was wrong and went to ask what. She then remembered Naruto was probably going to act all macho the second she asked him and not tell her so she went to the one person that would be able to tell her. She went to see Itachi.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>UCHIHA RESIDENCE – There is an episode where the residence is shown waaay back in the early episodes of Naruto so if you want to know how it looks go see cuz' i don't want to explain it.. XD!</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Kurama approached the giant wooden door and knocked softly on the door.A boy that reminded her of Itachi opened the door.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>SASUKE POV</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>*Meh..someones on the door..Guess I better go get it.*</p><p>Sasuke opened the door only to find a beautiful woman who looked like she was in her mid twenties..She wore a red kimono,had a perfect figure and flaming red hair..Yup..definitely a hooker..</p><p>"Sorry Miss..But I think you got the wrong place..A member of the Uchiha would not have an appointment with a whore."</p><p>Then suddenly he could feel a hand on his face.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>READER POV</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Kurama slapped the boy across the cheek with a little more strength that she wanted but after what he said he deserved it..The boy flew way across the garden and hit onto a wall.</p><p>This caused some noise and people came out. They were all stunned by who was at their door. Sasuke's father was one of them.</p><p>Kurama approached Sasuke and held her hand sky high,readying another nice slap across the boys face. His father stopped her just as her palm was about to reach his sons cheeks once more. Kurama turned to face him.</p><p>"Kurama-sama,if my son has caused you any problems let me be the one to punish him..But I don't think that is why you have come here."</p><p>Sasuke's brow twitched a little…Who the fuck was this woman,how was she so strong and why did his father add a –sama to her name?..He wandered.</p><p>"No I have come here to see the Sensei of my son,Itachi Uchiha..As for why I hit your son..the reason is simply that he called me a whore."</p><p>"I see..Well then someone go get Itachi please..As for you my son..We are going to have a talk."Said Fugaku.</p><p>Sasuke then spat in Kurama's face.</p><p>"I don't feel any guilt for calling you a whore. It's your fault whomever you are..You dress like one anyway..And how dare you hit me,an Uchi-"Fugaku clenched his sons mouth shut and made a mental note to teach him some manners.</p><p>"The Uchiha clan,thought respected,is not the best of all in Konoha..It would be best for you and for all of your clan to get rid of your Superiority Issue..boy..The reason I dress this way well…Every woman has her own style which she thinks looks good on her and considering the stares your cousins are giving me I think this fits me quite well."</p><p>She then turned around to see a whole group of embarrassed Uchiha. Kurama just smirked.</p><p>"Well then..Is Itachi home or not?"</p><p>"I'm here,Kurama-sama."</p><p>"Ahh good..I want you to tell me the details of the missions that my son and his team were doing today!"</p><p>Itachi's face then went grim..He then told her..Of the first few C ranked mission and then the D ranked one..Of how his team has already gotten the feeling of murder. She stared him wide-eyed..</p><p>"You have made three eight year old children…Kill someone?...Why the hell did you not simply reject the mission?"</p><p>"I don't know..I thought it was for the best."</p><p>"Tsk…I know that its better for them to experience it sooner than later so I will forgive you…But don't let them go on missions that require such things for a long time and focus on mainly C ranked missions and actual Training…"</p><p>"Yes,Ma'am!"</p><p>"Good,now..if you would excuse me."Said Kurama as she left the compound.</p><p>Fugaku turned his head to Sasuke.</p><p>"Son,we have to TALK."</p><p>"Tsk.."replied an angry Sasuke.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>INSIDE OF THE UCHIHA RESIDENCE</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Sasuke sat on a chair,waiting for his father to go all screaming on him for no good reason or at least for a reason he had no idea about.</p><p>Fugaku then approached his son and knelt before him.</p><p>"Listen son..That woman you just met..She is special to this village.."</p><p>"No she is not!If she was then I would know about her."</p><p>"You don't know about the Kitsune Clan?"</p><p>"Kitsune?You mean that idiot Naruto and whatever his mother's name was?"</p><p>"Yes,Them…Listen..they are a new clan here in Konoha but they are,in fact,the strongest of us all..So you better pay them some respect and that woman was Naruto's mother..Kurama Kitsune..her power is even greater than the Hokage and if you got into a fight with the either of them the whole of Konoha is going to go against you.."</p><p>"She's that powerful?"</p><p>"Yes..some say shes even going to be Hokage one day."</p><p>"Then she deserves my respect..but seriously..She dresses like a hooker,right?"</p><p>"Erm…don't tell anyone but..I too think her outfit is a little obscene.."</p><p>"I knew it! I couldn't be the only one."</p><p>"You should've seen the first time she entered our village..All the men from the Inuzuka clan cornered her the second they saw her..Most of them lost their manhood's in the process.."Said Fugaku while looking away..</p><p>"Uhh…Do not approach..threat with respect…stay away in order to protect privates..I got it!"</p><p>"That's my son."</p><p>Fugaku then patted his son and left him there..</p><p>Once he was out of sight , Sasuke muttered.</p><p>"I have to respect her..but…that doesn't mean I gotta respect Naruto too,right?"Said Sasuke with an evil glint in his eyes..</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>KITSUNE MANOR</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Kurama entered her house and immediately scanned it for Naruto. She did not see him anywhere so she decided he's probably in his room.</p><p>She got to the door to Naruto's room and knocked on the door.</p><p>"Yeah,who is it?"</p><p>"It's me."</p><p>"Come in."</p><p>Kurama then opened the door and found her son laying on the ground..one part of his face covered in tears and the other grinning madly…It was quite a sight.</p><p>"What the hell is wrong with me mom?One part of me wants to go back to that town and give that lowlife a proper burial and the other wants me to go and eat him..take everything from him..not to waste the spoils of a kill.."</p><p>"Nothing is wrong with you son..Just your demon and human sides battling each other."</p><p>"How do I stop it mom?They are both screaming in my head..I don't want to listen to them..the Either of them!"</p><p>"Then go into your Mindscape and talk to them..The demon will only be calm if you beat it into submission and continually get more powerful .. The Human part..you must reach an agreement with it."</p><p>"But how do I get into my mindscape?"</p><p>"You will learn in time to do it by yourself..but for now..Let me."</p><p>Kurama then placed her hand on her sons forehead, causing it to glow…Soon Naruto dropped to the floor. She then placed him on his bed.</p><p>"Good night,My little fox..I hope you make the right choice."She placed a kiss on his forehead and then left.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>NARUTO'S MINDSCAPE</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto woke up in an unfamiliar place…It was split into two. One part of it was a beautiful forest full of life..and the other was a burned forest,filled with decapitated remains of men,women,children and animals too..</p><p>He noticed,however that he himself was standing in the middle of it all..It was a long black road that seemed to glow..a blackened glow..He remembered how him mom told him that his complete demon form was a black fox. Maybe that had something to do with it.</p><p>Soon he was approached by two figures..One looked demonic and came from the burned forest and the other looked entirely human and he came from the opposite side.</p><p>"Are you..My human and my Demon selves?"</p><p><b>"Yes..we are."</b></p><p>"Then…Who want's to go first?"</p><p>The duo looked at each other.</p><p><b>"Can we both?"</b></p><p>"Ehh?You want to fight me?"</p><p><b>"No.."</b></p><p>"Then what?"</p><p><b>"We want to..become one once again."</b></p><p>"Once again?"</p><p><b>"We were one..This whole mind scape was at peace..untill today."</b></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p><b>"The Murder.."</b></p><p>"I see…Well then..How do I made you one with me again?"</p><p><b>"Right to the point..good..It is really simple..Follow this blackened path..what you need to do after will tell itself."</b></p><p>"Alright.."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>THE TRIAL OF THE BLACK ROAD</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto walked and walked to what felt like hours or days time…But surprisingly to him..he wasn't getting tired…Well this was HIS mindscape , wasn't it?Hmmm..That gives an idea.</p><p>"I WANT A HUGE BOWL OF RAMEN!"</p><p>Suddenly a meteor-sized bowl fell on him..Once he got out..He couldn't believe his eyes.</p><p>"I'm in HEAVEN!"</p><p>Once he finished eating he started to think..What time was it in the real world?</p><p>"Hey,ummm..Show me what time is it in the real world.."</p><p>Suddenly a clock showed that it was 10 PM.</p><p>"Only 5 minutes went by?No way!I am in here for like,DAYS!...But then again..maybe time goes differently here than it does in the real world."</p><p>He then continued down the road..He also noticed how that giant bowl of ramen did not fill him up at all..He felt..empty..</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>THE FIRST TEST</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Suddenly there were two figures in front of him.</p><p>One a human girl and another a fox.</p><p>"If you wanted a girlfriend,who would you chose?"</p><p>Naruto blushed but then realized that this was probably just another test..He thought for a while and then said.</p><p>"Can you turn into a human?"He asked the fox.</p><p>"No."Was the reply.</p><p>"Can you turn into a fox?"He asked the human this time.</p><p>"No."Was the reply.</p><p>"Then..I don't want the either of you.I want someone alike to myself..Both an Animal and a Human..Just like my Mom."</p><p>The duo looked at each other and then they practically walked into each other…A bright light burst forth and from it , a woman that had fox like ears and a tail behind her.</p><p>"What about now?"</p><p>"Now,that you are one..I would chose you..I don't want you to be separate..I want both."</p><p>The woman smiled and then disappeared. Naruto then continued down the road.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>THE SECOND TEST</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Another two figures appeared..One was a little fox and the other was a kid. The kid was strangling the fox.</p><p>Naruto felt the urge to kill the kid..or just let him kill the little fox , once again , he chose neither.</p><p>Naruto Jumped and saved the fox. He then let it nest in his arms..He looked at the kid.</p><p>"Don't hurt her..She's just a little kit."</p><p>"So am I..And she bit me when i tried to pet it!"</p><p>"Maybe it's because shes just hungry…Why don't you go get some food for her and then try to pet her?"</p><p>The kid then ran into an imaginary house..It brought a piece of meat.A leftover from lunch.</p><p>The kid put it down and waited..Naruto let go of the fox..The fox slowly approached the kid and then started eating it's given meal. The kid then slowly petted the fox with it's hand.</p><p>"This is better…I'm sowwy foxy..I didn't wanna hurt you."</p><p>The fox finished eating and then curled up into the kids lap.A while later,they both soundly fell asleep and vanished.</p><p>Naruto continued down the blackened road.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>THE THIRD TEST</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>He soon reached it's end..He didn't realize it but he was climbing a mountain. He saw the two he met before, his human and demon self appeared chained to rocks..they were also bleeding..A crowbar appeared in his hands. It was old and rusty and looked like it could break easily..He also noted how it had two same ends..</p><p>A big statue appeared in front of him. It said.</p><p><b><i>"Use the crowbar. Chose who do you want to save..Chose..One path.."</i></b></p><p>Naruto looked at the crowbar and then to his two selves..</p><p><b>"Save me!I will give you UNIMAGINABLE POWER!"</b>Screamed his demon self.</p><p><b>"Save me!And you will remain Human!You will become a HERO!"</b>Screamed his human self in turn.</p><p>Naruto looked once again on the crowbar…He noticed how the middle was the most rusted and could be easily broken..he also remembered how this was,in fact,HIS mind scape..</p><p>"No one..Will ORDER ME... WHAT I ...do here."</p><p>And with that he grew his body into that of a giant..he then split the crowbar in two with his knee and saved both of his selves at the same time.</p><p>The statue replied..</p><p><i><b>"You have walked this Road of Life..You have been given three tests..And all ended up black..You are no demon,boy..But you are not completely human either..I do not know was it from need or greed..but your choices have made your mind at peace once again..Congratulations,young kit..You have done well..for one so young…I hope we shall meet once again..In true form…In Algarth..The realm of Demon Beasts…See you soon..Young one!"</b></i>The statue then disappeared and Naruto watched his two selves merge into one..</p><p>It was a person the same size as him but you couldn't see it's face or it's gender because blackened flames enveloped it's whole body..It looked human..but at the same time the black flames gave off a powerful diabolical presence..</p><p>"Finally!I'm BACK!"Screamed the new person.</p><p>"Soo..you're like my..Demon and Human Half?"</p><p>"Heh..you can call me Hybrid!"</p><p>"Alright then,Hybrid-kun..or –chan?"</p><p>"It's -Kun…You're male..so what the heck made you think I wouldn't be?"</p><p>"Yeah..I guess that figures..Sooo, How the hell do I get outa here?"</p><p>"…same as you did all this up untill now?"</p><p>"So,I just imagine a gate and it appears?"</p><p>"Yeah!"</p><p>"Alright..lets give that a try."</p><p>Just as Naruto thought of it a gate appeared..It looked more like a portal of sorts..And he could see the ceiling of his room.</p><p>"Huh?The ceiling?"</p><p>"Yeah,we are seeing through your own eyes..Mother put our body on the bed."</p><p>"Ahh..so that's why.."</p><p>Naruto turned to see Hybrid once more..He didn't know why he didn't notice before but there were five black tails behind him.</p><p>"I have FIVE tails?"</p><p>"Yeah..but you can only bring out about two..So the other three don't actually count."</p><p>"Ack!I gotta remember to train more."</p><p>"Yeah,please do..I wanna give you more of my power.I want to help you."</p><p>"Your power?"</p><p>"Well…OUR power..but since you can't bring it out..It's mostly MY power.."</p><p>"Ah..Do you have to be so mean?"</p><p>"I'm you..So if I'm mean then so are you."</p><p>"That makes sense…Give me advice sometimes okay?I could use it!"</p><p>"I'll try..Maybe you will get so stupid you wont notice things that you actually did notice but you didn't at the same time so I am going to have to remind you.."</p><p>"…..Wut?"</p><p>"Nah,Never mind..Just go already.."</p><p>"Sure,sure..Se ya soon!"</p><p>Naruto disappeared through the gate..Hybrid then looked at the disappearing portal.</p><p>"Yeah…. let's hope you don't have to see me soon…because that would mean something bad happened…"Said Hybrid as he went to repair the damages done to Naruto's mindscape during his absence.</p><p>He turned to see a burned forest and one completely untouched.</p><p>"Geez..Just how much DAMAGE can those two retards do in one day..?"</p><p>He then pointed his finger to the burned forest and regrew it. Then he used both of his hands and pointed two fingers..One on the regrown and one on the older forest..Then with a flick of his finger he made it all burn in blackened flames..The tree's never stop burning but they aren't disappearing..Anything living or the remains of what was once living,however a while..Only ashes remained..</p><p>Hybrid just smirked."Until we find someone who is the same as us..Nothing will be able to enter these forests without consequences.."His face turned sad.</p><p>"But at least for now..Peace has returned to this world.."His face visibly softened.</p><p>He then returned to the black mountain and spawned a bed.."Time to sleep..once again.."And so he fell a sleep on his imaginary bed..Resting until he is needed once more. Suddenly, his eyes opened wide.</p><p>"Oh shit!I forgot to tell him my <i><b>real</b></i> name…Maybe that's for the best..He won't know what to expect…<i><b>from his own Madness Itself</b></i>!"</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>CHAPTER END</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i><b>Nexus : Yes yes yes!Finally..More insanity!I simply can't make a main character..I can't make a hero without turning them insane!But then again,that's just my style!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Hope you all liked it!See ya all soon!XD</b></i></p>
