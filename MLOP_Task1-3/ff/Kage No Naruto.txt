1: A World of Darkness and Pain</b></p><p>Naruto
gave a short cry of pain as he was slammed into the ground. He tried
to get up and run, but a pair of kunai cut his retreat off. Blood was
running down his forehead, from where the kunai had cut him, but even
as his pursuers watched the cut closed up and the blood stopped
flowing. The seven year old turned to face his attackers, who were
none other than a group of drunken chuunins. He knew exactly why they
were after him, it<i> was </i>the 10th of October, and
Kami knows that the entire village would be out to get him on this
day. He was just glad that there were no jounin with the group.</p><p>At
first Naruto tried to fight the men, but was held firmly to the
ground and his feeble attempts at protecting himself were mocked at.
Blows upon blows rained down on the helpless child. The commotion
even attracted the attention of a few villagers who were happy to
have an opportunity to beat up the 'demon brat'.</p><p>By
the time he was found by Hokage, Naruto was barely clinging on to
life.</p><p>"Kami-sama…'
gasped the aged man in shock, as he watched the small boy convulse in
pain. His eyes had been gauged out and blood flowed from the various
cuts on his body, literally flooding the small alley. No body should
have been able to produce this much blood, but the hokage attributed
it to the demon within the boy.</p><p>Wasting
no time, Sarutobi rushed over to Naruto and administered what healing
jutsu he knew, to stabilize the boy's condition. Within seconds the
royal robes of the Hokage were dyed red with blood. The old man
watched in horror as the boy turned his head and gave the Hokage an
up close view of his mutilated eye sockets.</p><p>"Oyaji?"</p><p>"I'm
here Naruto, everything will be fi…" and before the man could
complete his sentence, Naruto fell into a deep sleep, only to wake up
three months later, to find his world plunged in darkness.</p><p><i>Three months later</i></p><p>"Lord Hokage,"
gasped the chuunin, out of breath, "The hospital sent word, Naruto
is wake."</p><p>Sarutobi's eyes
widened as he practically jumped from the window and raced towards
the hospital, while constantly thinking of the boy and his mental
health. The only good thing that had come out of this was that, the
criminals had been dealt with…by Ibikiand then publicly
executed.</p><p>Reaching the hospital
he wasted no time in reaching the Naruto's room. He knocked quietly
and after a muffled "Come in." he opened his eyes to see a blonde
boy with bandages over his eyes.</p><p>"Naruto, how do you
feel?" Sarutobi inquired.</p><p>"I'm fine
Oya-ji…why did it happen? Why?" even though the boy could no
longer cry the tear in the his voice, spoke volumes of the pain he
felt.</p><p>"…"</p><p>"WHY DOES IT ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE ME!!!!! WHY DO I HAVE TO BE THE ONE TO SUFFER!!!!!"</p><p>No longer being able to
stop the tears flowing from his eyes, Sarutobi went to Naruto's bed
and hugged him, the boy latched onto the only source of comfort he
could find and let go of all his emotions. He screamed, complained
and finally when he was exhausted, he asleep, with the hokage still
by his side.</p><p>He was falling, and
there was darkness all around, he landed on the ground with a splash
as his sandals hit water. Naruto could see a light at the end, wait a
minute he could <i>see</i>.</p><p>"YATTA! I can see, I
can see." Before the blonde could start dancing, he heard a
whisper.</p><p>It was like a gust of
cold wind in the middle of summers, the words seemed soft, yet they
somehow resonated. Someone was calling him, beckoning him to come
forward, to come into the light, and that was exactly what Naruto
did. The light lead him to a huge chamber filled with pipes, both red
and blue in color. A large cage filled up most of the chamber, beyond
which no light penetrated. As Naruto walked closer to the golden bars
he noticed a large paper with <i>seal</i> written on it pasted on one
of the bars. Upon a closer inspection, the bars, he noticed complex
seals inscribed on it.</p><p>But before Naruto could
touch one of the bars, a pair of red eyes snapped open from behind
the cage, only a few inches from Naruto's face. With a shout of
alarm he jumped back.</p><p>"Wha…"</p><p></p><p><b>Is that the best
response you can give boy? </b>Came a booming voice. Squinting his
eyes, Naruto could see a humanoid shape crouching on the ground.</p><p>"Who are you? And
where am I?" inquired the boy.</p><p></p><p><b>We are inside your
mind fool, and as for who I am, why don't you ask your <i>precious</i>
grandfather. </b></p><p>"What the hell are we
doing here you er! And why did you bring me here?<b>" </b></p><p></p><p><b>My my, cursing at
such a young age…you're not as bad as I thought. </b>Said the
voice, sounding amused. <b>I've brought you here to strike a
deal…As you can see I'm trapped here. I will give you anything
you want, in exchange of my freedom. </b></p><p>"Hey pal" shouted
Naruto, "I'm not stupid! Why the hell should I free you, whoever you are, you're here for a reason. I
don't want anything from a scumbag like you!"</p><p></p><p><b>YOU WOULD DO WELL TO
MIND YOUR TONGUE BOY! LEST I RIP IT OUT! </b>A large amounted of
killing intent washed over Naruto, blasting him away to the opposing
wall and making it difficult for him to breath. After what seemed
like a lifetime, the pressure finally lifted, and he was able to
breathe again. <b>You have spirit boy, you are foolish, but brave.
Now if you value the life of the old man you love, you <i>will</i>
make a deal with me. </b>With these words the figure waved his hand
and an image formed in front of Naruto. The hokage lay on the ground,
clutching his throat. Writhing on the ground as his life force slowly
slipped into the underworld.</p><p>"YOU BASTARD! WHAT
DID YOU DO TO HIM!"</p><p></p><p><b>Nothing that you
can't prevent. Simply agree with the deal and I'll spare his
life.</b></p><p>"You hurt, him…and
I'll kill you." And without warning wisps, of dark chakra
surrounded Naruto, as he rushed forward, not taking account the bars
that separated him and his pray. Even before he could reach his
destination, a hand shot out from the cage and slammed Naruto back
into the wall.</p><p></p><p><b>You have potential
boy…here take my gift. We shall meet again...</b></p><p>Before he could make a sound, Naruto was once again hit by the massive killing intent, but this time instead of making him cower with fear, it forced him out.
Out into the real world.</p><p>Once again blackness
greeted him, as a sigh of relief left his lips. A second later the
seven year old's world burst into pain, most of the pain was
surrounding his eyes. It felt as if someone had taken a hot poker and
rammed it into his eyes. Naruto could distinctly make out the noise
of door banging open and frantic voices, before he succumbed, once
again to unconsciousness.</p><p><b>How did you like it.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p align="center"><b>Chapter
2: And There Was Light</b></p><p><b>Disclaimer: I do not own Naruto or Splinter cell. They belong to their respective owners</b></p><p>Sarutobi watched as the
med-nins worked tirelessly to stabilize the boy's condition. He was
not stupid, he recognized the evil chakra that was concentrated in
Naruto's eyes. He knew not what was going on behind those bandages,
but he knew enough about the Kyuubi's chakra to know that if it
didn't stop, then boy he considered his grandson, would, invariably
die.</p><p>"How is he?" he
asked, his voice laced with worry as the head medic finished the
final check up of the boy.</p><p>"I think that you
should come to my office Hokage-sama." Without a word both men
turned, and the Hokage made to follow the slightly younger man. They
were delayed a little as the Hokage had to pause for a little while
to visit another patient. One who had suffered as much as the blonde
jailor.</p><p>"Ohayo Gozaimazu
Anko-san." Greeted the Hokage.</p><p>A girl, not even in her
teens, lifted her and smiled at the old man. "What is it old man?"
she inquired.</p><p>"Nothing, I was just
passing by when I thought to see how you were faring. I know that you
have gone through a bad experience. I just want you to know that
you're welcome to talk to me whenever you feel like it. My doors
are always open to you Anko-chan."</p><p>A brief flash of pain
passed over the girl's face, before she masked her face with a cold
expression. A smile planted firmly on her face. "Ya ya old man…now
leave before I stick this kunai in you." She said, holding a kunai
with her left hand, the hand that was empty just moments prior.
Sarutobi suppressed his look of pity as he recognized the mask being
put on. Forcing his lips to form a smile, he said, "Jan ne
Anko-chan."</p><p>"Sayonara oyaji."</p><p>With a nod, the Hokage
closed the door and motioned for the doctor to lead him to his
office. After five minutes, the hokage found himself in a white
office, with a hot cup of green tea between his hands. He looked
around and barely suppressed a grimaced as he saw the pure white
walls. <i>God I hate hospitals. </i>There was a large desk, made out
of mahogany. On it were various reports and files, no doubt belonging
to the innumerable patients in the hospital. Various medical machines
were scattered throughout the room. A small bed occupied the left
side of the room, while huge file cabinets covered the rear wall. All
in all the place looked rather bland, and would have been more
fitting for a Hyuuga.</p><p>The doctor was seated
behind the desk and was quietly sipping a saucer of sake.</p><p>"Lord Hokage. I will
get to the point and tell you that the boy is suffering of chakra
poisoning. It is an extremely rare case, and normally does not happen
with ninja. Large quantities of <i>that</i> chakra has been
concentrating around his eyes, causing us to believe that the demon
is attempting to give the boy his eyes back."</p><p>A small gasp escaped
from sarutobi's lips. He had known that the demon had granted
Naruto extensive healing capabilities, but <i>regeneration</i>, that
was something he had never even dreamed to be possible.</p><p>"However,"
continued the doctor, seeming unaware of the older man's shock,
"The massive influx of foreign chakra has destabilized the boy's
chakra system. He is at a stage where two things could happen…he
would either die a horrible death, where his chakra coils would
literally vaporize leaving him in constant agony for approximately
two weeks…or…his chakra coils could become extremely thick, which
might enable to use high level jutsu rather easily, and making it
difficult to attack his internal organs with chakra. It would make
Jyuuken use, rather ineffective…however to tell you the truth
Hokage-sama, his chances of survival are extremely low, not more than
five percent…I am sorry."</p><p>Sarutobi sat shell
shocked as he listened to the doctor make his report. Never in his
life had he heard anything like this. A lone tear escaped the man's
eye at the thought of losing his self proclaimed grandson. Without
even looking at the medic, the hokage left the office.</p><p>He remembered all the
times he had with Naruto, he still remembered the day he had picked
up Naruto from the debris left over from the kyuubi's rampage. When
he had seen the look on Naruto's face, he had smiled and forgotten
the wreckage that surrounded him. The small chibi-Naruto gurgled
happily and made a grab for the old monkey's nose. The hokage had
watched the boy grow up from the shadows. He had provided for the boy
when he had been unable to do so. He had even sneaked into Naruto's
apartment just to put some extra ryo on the boy's nightstand, when
he had run out of cash.</p><p>But despite all that,
the Hokage simply couldn't do anything to help Naruto out at this
time. For all the power the old man possessed, right now, at that
particular point of time, he felt helpless. With a sigh, the hokage
started to make for his office, to tackle the paperwork that had no
doubt accumulated over the period of time he was busy…</p><p><b>BOOM</b></p><p>An explosion of chakra
rocked the hospital, the bang was soon followed by a large amount of
chakra output. The chakra felt tainted and evil. A chakra that had
not been felt since seven years. All plans of paperwork vanished from
Sarutobi's mind as he quickly rushed to Naruto's room. Nothing
could have prepared him for what he saw next</p><p>On the bed lay Naruto,
writhing in pain and clutching the bandages surrounding his eyes, he
parted his lips only to let out a scream so horrifying and filled
with pain that it sent chills down the hokage's spine. The door
behind Hokage exploded as various med-nins and ANBU rushed into the
room, no doubt attracted by the chakra and the boy's screams.</p><p>The medics did all that
they could to calm Naruto, they even tried to tranquilize him, but
nothing worked. The screams continued for fifteen minutes, but to
everyone present it looked like hours had passed, as they all watched
the small boy convulse in pain, with them…the famed Konoha nin
watching in horror, unable to do a simple thing like assisting the
boy.</p><p>Once the screams
subsided, so did the sudden lethargy of the doctors. At once they all
sprang into action, using various medical jutsus to ascertain the
boy's condition. After waiting for an hour, Sarutobi's patience
finally ran through</p><p>"What is it? What the
hell happened to him?" the hokage all but screamed at the mass of doctors.</p><p>"N-nothing
hokage-sama," stuttered a medic, his eyes wide, "The boy seams to
be absolutely fine. No signs of damage at all! He has regained his
eyesight."</p><p>Before the doctor could
continue, the old man, finally having enough excitement to last a
lifetime…promptly fainted.</p><p><b>Author's Notes</b></p><p><b>I don't know
the technical term for cot type thingy doctors use to treat their
patients with, so bear with me.</b></p><p><b>How did you like it.
Was it good, bad or does it deserve to be taken down
entirely...Please review, constructive criticism is welcome. I know
that I promised longer chapters, but to see the all-mighty professor
fainting seemed…just right</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p align="center"><b>Chapter
3: A Time For Explanations</b></p><p><b>Disclaimer: I don't
own Naruto or Splinter Cell. They belong to their respective owners</b></p><p>Sarutobi opened his
eyes; an unwilling groan escaped his lips. He raised his head to find
himself in a hospital room. A bottle of glucose was connected to
him…his eyes widened as he remembered the events of last
twenty-four hours.</p><p>Naruto's awakening…</p><p>The boy crying his
heart out…</p><p>The screams!</p><p>The Chakra poisoning…</p><p><i>Kami! Naruto…</i>with
surprising strength, Sarutobi dragged himself out of the bed and made
his way to Naruto's room number. As he reached the room, he
couldn't help but smile at the irony fate put the boy through. The
numbers 999 were displayed on the door in bright red.</p><p>As silently as he
could, he opened the door. Startling a medic, who was just finishing
with his check up on the boy.</p><p>"How is he?"
inquired the Hokage.</p><p>"Much better
Hokage-sama. I expect him to be at 100 efficiency within two to a
maximum of three days."</p><p>A small smile crept up
on the older man's face, highlighting the many wrinkles and age
lines on his face, and for the first time the Hokage looked his
age…"You never seize to surprise me Naruto." The words were
said so quietly that, the medic, who was standing close to his lord,
could barely hear them. The doctor switched his gaze to his patients'
face.</p><p><i>How could a boy, who
could give an old man such happiness, be a demon.</i> He thought
before leaving the room as quietly as he could. So as to not to
disturb the surrogate grandfather and his grandson.</p><p>Sarutobi moved to sit
on a chair near Naruto's bed, when a slight twitch in the yellow
haired brat's hand caught his attention. The smile quickly upgraded
itself into a full blown grin as he took a seat and placed his hand
on Naruto's much smaller one. The slight touch caused Naruto to
jerk into consciousness. A red glow could be seen, emanating from
behind the bandages.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Naruto woke up upon
feeling a hand touch his own; he moved his other hand to his eyes,
only to find them be stopped by bandages.</p><p>"I think that we
should wait for the doctors, ne Naruto-kun."</p><p>"O-ojisan…" the
boy sounded surprised, and for a moment Sarutobi wondered if his so
called had made it through the ordeal with his sanity in tact…</p><p>But before Sarutobi
could continue his train of though, he was hugged fiercely by a seven
year old prankster. The hokage returned the hug, only to feel Naruto
shaking slightly.</p><p>"Are you alright
Naruto?"</p><p>Naruto lifted his head,
and Sarutobi could see tears escaping from behind the bandages.
"I…the man…" Naruto choked out, "He was killing you!"</p><p>"Who? As you can see
my boy, I am absolutely fine. There's some time before the medics
come to check on you again, so why don't you tell me the reason for
your fears?" the elder man asked.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>So for half an hour,
Naruto explained, to the best of his ability what that <i>man</i> had
done.</p><p>Upon finishing, Naruto
asked exactly what Sandaime had dreaded. "ne, ojisan…who was that
man?"</p><p>Sarutobi looked at the
boy, he was about to reveal a secret that he knew would change
Naruto's attitude towards the village. He just hoped that the boy
could forgive both him and this village. With a sigh Sandaime parted
his lips, to unknowingly reveal a secret that would rock the
foundations of the entire shinobi world.</p><p>"Naruto, you know
that Kyuubi attacked Konoha seven years ago, right?"</p><p>After being answered by
a nod, he continued, "A great battle followed. Even the combined
might of every ninja of Konoha, we couldn't put a stop to the
demon's rampage. On the contrary, we actually managed to annoy it.
The battle lasted for the entire day. That is until the Yondaime
appeared upon his summon. He used one of his special techniques and
Gamabunta's attacks to draw the Kyuubi's attention. This gave the
remaining ninja's enough time regroup and use their most powerful
jutsus at the demon. Managing to atleast disorient it. This gave the
fourth all the time he needed to completed the most advanced sealing
technique known to man. Using his on body as a medium, the fourth
summoned the Shinigami. Using the death god's power, yondaime
managed to seal away the Kyuubi in a child. No one knows where he got
the child from, some say that he was an orphan, and some he was the
child of yondaime himself…that child was you Naruto…"</p><p>Comprehension dawned on
naruto's bandaged face. His eyebrows shot up, and his mouth opened
slightly. "What does that mean oji-san. That I'm yondaime's…"</p><p>Not wanting to give
Naruto the wrong idea, Sandaime quickly stopped that train of
thought. "No Naruto, as far as I'm aware the Fourth had no child,
and was unmarried. I believe that your resemblance to him is because
of the seal he crafted on you."</p><p>With an almost
unnoticeable nod, the blond continued, "So that's why they hate
me, the villagers I mean. They think that I'm kyuubi…I'm not,
right."</p><p>"No your not Naruto,
unfortunately though the villagers only see you as a scapegoat…I
think that a part pf them believes you to be innocent, but the loss
of their loved ones is still fresh in their minds. Whenever they see
you Naruto, they pain comes back, and rational logic leaves them,
they can't see reason…I request you, please do not be angry at
them. I know that it's a bit much to ask, but I know you. I know
how you are behind that mask of yours. Don't forgive them, but I
beg you, please don't judge them too harshly."</p><p>"I promise ojisan. I
will not hate them, they can't control their actions. I promise
that one day, I will lift the curtain that blinds them, and make them
see the truth…I promise."</p><p>"I also want to warn
you Naruto, Kyuubi is a fox, and like all kitsunes, he is extremely
cunning. He tricked you once already and will try to do so again, be
extremely careful when dealing with him, and if possible don't talk
to him at all!"</p><p>"Now on a pleasant
note, the doctors and I believe that Kyuubi has given you your eyes
back…"</p><p>But before they could
continue their conversation however, a group of medics entered the
room. Upon seeing their patient awake, their eyes widened a bit. But
they only acknowledged both the occupants with a short bow,
"Hokage-sama, Naruto-san."</p><p>"Ah, I'm glad that
you came. I was just about to send for you anyways. I think that
Naruto here might be getting a little frustrated with the bandages,
and I'm sure all of us are excited to see his eyes. Do you think
that it's safe to remove the bandages medic-san."</p><p>"I don't see any
reason not to Hokage-sama." Said a medic, while scanning Naruto's
body, who had his mouth wide open, slight drool was beginning to
escape.</p><p>The other medic picked
up the scissors which were placed in a small tray full of other
medicines and tools. He moved over to Naruto, "Please close your
eyes Naruto-san, and don't open them till you are instructed to do
so." He ordered the boy, who only replied with a nod of his head,
his mouth firmly shut again.</p><p>With a firm hand the
second medic tilted Naruto's head and kept him firmly in place. The
other medic used the scissors to quickly rid the boy of the bandages
that were covering his eyes. "Now Naruto-san, slowly open your eyes
and tell us if you can see again."</p><p>Slowly Naruto opened
his eyes. A red glow surrounded his eyes, and he immediately shut
them. "Too bright…" he managed mutter. With a nod, Sarutobi
signaled the medics to switch off the lights and close the curtains.
"Open them again Naruto," he commanded softly.</p><p>Once again Naruto
opened his eyes, in the dark room Naruto's eyes glowed like a
shining beacon. "Whoa…everything's so…bright," he
exclaimed.</p><p>"Listen to me Naruto,
I want you to relax your eyes. Close them and think about something
that soothes you." Instinctively, Naruto thought about the
darkness, the feeling of complete invisibility that the darkness gave
him. It was his savior; it helped him hide from villagers and guided
him home. Unknown to him, Naruto's chakra had started reacting to
its master's call, and Naruto's form started flickering. One
second he could be seen, and the next he seemed to dissolve
completely. But Naruto didn't notice all this, he was experiencing
peace for the first time in his life, the feeling of tranquility. He
felt free…more free than he had felt ever, he could sense
everything in the room. From the three other occupants to the small
insects crawling on the walls.</p><p>The feeling stopped
however, when the lights came back on. Suddenly feeling blinded,
Naruto quickly opened his eyes, forgetting for a second his previous
experience. What he saw however, confused him to no extent. The
Hokage had kunais in both of his hands, and the doctors had something
green coating their hands. The Hokage's hands tightened around the
kunai when he saw Naruto's eyes.</p><p>"What!" exclaimed
Naruto, freaked out by the sudden hostility shown by his adoptive
grandfather. Without a word, the Hokage pointed one of his kunai to
the mirror. Naruto practically jumped from his bed and made his way
over to the mirror. What he saw, gave him the shock of his life, and
the citizens of Konoha a splitting headache, as a shout penetrated
all windows and houses. The sound was even heard, in a heavily
soundproofed room, in the lowest dungeons of the Hokage tower, where
it put a sadistic smile on the face of one torture expert.</p><p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!"</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX<br>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p align="center"><b>Chapter
4: A Request is Made</b></p><p><b>Disclaimer: I don't
own Naruto or Splinter Cell. They belong to their respective owners.</b></p><p>The passing hour saw
Naruto, Sandaime and the head medic; who Naruto found out to be named
Toru, seated in the office of the Kage of the Hidden Leaf Village.</p><p>A pair of confused red
eyes stared at the hokage, as Sarutobi pulled out a pipe from his
robes and calmly lit it, he then proceeded to close his eyes and take
in a long breath, allowing the tobacco to calm his nerves and poison
his lungs. He opened his eyes, and returned naruto's gaze. Smiling
at the boy's expression, he turned to the other man seated in his
office.</p><p>"So Toru-san, do you
have an explanation for this…unique change?"</p><p>"I don't know
hokage-sama. When I was conducting a check up on Naruto-san, I
noticed a change in his eye structure, but I merely assumed it to be
the result of the fox regenerating the boy's eyes."</p><p>Once again Sarutobi
turned to his young grandson, who was uncharacteristically sitting
quietly and just listening to his two superiors form theories.
"Naruto, do your eyes feel any different?"</p><p>"Hai. I can see much
better, Its like shadows don't exist for me! I can see all the dust
in the air. I can even count the wrinkles on your face ojisan!"
exclaimed the boy, to which the hokage merely responded by a slight
chuckle, before his face once again turned serious.</p><p>"The only reason I
can think of is that this is the 'gift' Kyuubi spoke of. From
what you say, It enables you to see much clearly, and when you pump
chakra into your eyes, it helps you see in the dark," Sarutobi
switched his gaze towards Toru, "do you think that this could cause
problems in the future?"</p><p>"As I said
Sarutobi-sama, I have never experienced nothing like this before.
Somehow the fox managed to restore the chakra pathways surrounding
Naruto's eyes and genetically alter the structure of his eyes, also there is no trace of Kyuubi's chakra. I
believe that as long as Naruto does not force the beast's chakra into
his eyes, he should be completely fine."</p><p>"Thank you Toru-san.
It goes without saying that news of this incident should not leak
out. It must be treated as an S-class secret, adequate <i>punishment</i>
will be dealt out. Now, I believe that I've kept you from your work
long enough…", not missing the signs of clear dismissal, the head
medic got up and bowed once before leaving.</p><p>Once the medic had left
the office Sarutobi quickly flashed through a dozen seals and put up
a sound barrier surrounding his office. "Now Naruto, what was that
trick you pulled in the hospital." Asked Sarutobi, his tone firm
and voice cold. Upon hearing his 'grandfather' change so much, Naruto
stuttered a bit, but replied nonetheless.</p><p>"I..I don't know…I
closed my eyes and thought about darkness and I felt good, I felt
free. What happened?"</p><p>"Nothing much, for a
second it was like you had literally faded into the shadows. I
couldn't even sense your chakra anymore." Said Sarutobi, leaving
a thoroughly shocked Naruto.</p><p>"But…but that's
not possible, is it, I mean…I'm not from Shikamaru's clan, am
I?"</p><p>"No you're not, not
even Nara Shikato can do something like that, and he's the clan head." the Hokage pause,
his expressions changed to indicate an idea. "Tell me Naruto,
you've been going to the academy for two years now. Do you know how
to generate chakra?"</p><p>"Hai, we've covered the theory but we have never done it before."</p><p>" Don't worry. All you need to do is to hold this handsign, an concentrate on mixing your spiritual and physical energy...Now Naruto, generate
some chakra for me."</p><p>Without a word Naruto
stood up and closed his eyes. His face twisted into one of
concentration as he combined his physical energy and spiritual
energy. Once again, Naruto felt the freedom he had felt in the
hospital room, and opened his eyes.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Sarutobi looked into
the slitted eyes of Naruto while he concentrated, a few seconds
later, a dark glow surrounded Naruto. The boy didn't vanish like
the last time, but dark wisps of chakra flared around him, blowing
his sun kissed hair with wind that could not be felt. Slowly Naruto opened his
eyes and met the shocked ones of his leader.</p><p>A few seconds passed as
both the occupants of the room fully grasped the situation at hand.
Finally Sarutobi overcame his shock and told Naruto to stop
channeling chakra.</p><p>"Never…never in my
life had I thought that I would encounter something so marvelous."
He muttered to himself, as he took a long puff of his pipe.</p><p>"ne, oyaji…what
just happened. Why was my chakra black?"</p><p>Sarutobi gave a small
smile, "Well…before I state my theory, let me give you a brief
history lesson. You see Naruto, there are three types of chakras in
the world. Holy, human and demon chakra. Each of them has their own
unique properties. But a few millennia ago, it was not so. There were
only two forms of chakra – Holy and demonic. Holy chakra was, as
you would no doubt have figured out could only be channeled by celestial
beings, except one. Only the Shinigami could not use this chakra. In
its raw form it could be used to heal any form of injury and give its
wielder the power to use Light based jutsus. The demonic chakra on the
other hand, was corrosive in nature. In its raw form, it could poison
and burn down any thing it came in contact with. Jutsus could not be
used with this chakra, but in its raw form itself, it was an
immensely destructive. It as much later that the third form of
chakra…human chakra came into existence. It was actually an angel
cast out of heaven who introduced this chakra. It is not known why
that angel was cast out, but before he as exiled to our plane, the
ability to wield holy chakra was taken away by Kami. Instead leaving
him with an impure form of chakra, human chakra. Upon realizing that he sstill possessed chakra, he started experimenting with it to find its properties. He found that he could concentrate chakra into various parts of
his body, to increase the strength of those parts. Thousands of years
later, this ability diluted further, and was passed on to his
descendants, which were later called – shinobi."</p><p>"This however does
not concern you, like I mentioned before, only the Shinigami did not
wield holy chakra. Instead he wielded darkness chakra, it gave him
complete control over life and death. It is believed that his form of
chakra was so great and terrible that all the other celestial beings,
including his brother, Kami, were both jealous and afraid of him. I
think that during your sealing when the yondaime summoned Shinigami,
some of his chakra got trapped in you. It lay dormant and mixed with
your own chakra. Making an entirely new form of chakra. It seems that
your chakra in its raw form, lets you control shadows. But why it
showed now, and not earlier, I cannot say. There is one more test to
see how strong and diverse this new chakra is."</p><p>Sarutobi opened one of
his desk drawers and took out a card, "I want you to channel some
of your chakra into this card."</p><p>Nodding, Naruto took
the paper from Sarutobi and channeled some chakra into the paper. A
small tearing sound could be heard, as the paper split into two. "What
does that mean Hokage-sama?" said Naruto, not realizing his slip
up.</p><p>The hokage refrained
the urge to smile upon hearing Naruto of all people calling him by
his title. "It means what I had hoped it would. Your chakra is some
sort of hybrid between human and shinigami's chakra. It allows you
to control shadows to some extent, but at the same time it has not
lost its ability to become aligned with nature. Every normal human's
chakra has an affinity towards either one of the natures forces.
After some time their chakra can be aligned to more than one element.
The elements are either fire, water, wind, lightening or earth. The
card I gave you was a chakra sensitive card. You have wind affinity
because your paper split into two. It means that you'll have less
problems with using wind related jutsu, and with some training you
might even gain some control over that element. However I suspect
that because of your 'shadow' chakra you might not be able to use
all types of jutsus. I think you might not be able to perform any
jutsu which is higher than B-Rank."</p><p>Naruto, who upto this
point was getting ready to shout about being an all-powerful ninja</p><p>Quickly shut his mouth
and looked disappointed.</p><p>Upon seeing the look on
the young boy's face, Sarutobi couldn't help but laugh, "Oh
Naruto-kun," he said, rubbing tears of mirth out of his eyes,
"don't be disappointed, I'm sure that you'll be able to
perform tones of never before seen techniques with your new chakra."</p><p>Upon hearing these
words the boy brightened up considerably and shouted while raising
his fists, "Yosh! I will use my new powerful chakra, and become the
greatest Hokage their ever was!" he ended with a classic 'thumbs
up' pose, that reminded hokage of a certain 'beast'.</p><p>Before Sarutobi could
say something, Naruto once again started looking gloomy.</p><p>"Hey ojisan…I was
thinking about what you told me about the villagers might not hating
me deep down, I want to believe it, but…I think that even the
slight possibility of them acknowledging me might never happen if I
stay here and continue to remind them of what they lost. I…I was
thinking of leaving the village for some years to train. So that when
I come back they can acknowledge me for who I am, and not who I keep
imprisoned in me."</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Sarutobi's face
changed into one of confusion, frankly, he had never expected such a
request from the boy? His face displaying a number of emotions,
ranging from confusion (which was the first), to one of frustration,
contemplation, resignation and finally sadness.</p><p>"Naruto," he
sighed, "While you might be correct in assuming that the villager's
hate might lesson if you don't stay in the village, however I
cannot in good conscience allow a seven year old boy out into the
shinobi world. I'm sorry Naruto, but I'm going to have deny your
request."</p><p>Sarutobi could not bear
the heartbroken expression on Naruto's face, once more the Hokage
closed his eyes and uttered an audible sigh. "Come again at noon
tomorrow, We'll arrange something then."</p><p>The heartbroken
expression quickly morphed into one of jubilation so fast that the
hokage was forced to think that Naruto had used some kind of genjutsu</p><p>A loud yell of
"YATTA!!." Could be heard by everyone throughout the village, "I
will be here the first thing in the morning," he concluded in a
softer tone.</p><p>Practically jumping
with joy the seven year old happily exited he tower, and went to his
home, where he kept track of each hour that would lead him closer to
gaining the village's respect.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</b></p><p>"What will you do
now?" asked a voice</p><p>"I don't know. The
boy is right, him leaving he village might cool down things a bit.
But no seven year old can survive in the shinobi world."</p><p>"You have me…I'll
watch over him." Said the mysterious voice.</p><p>A small chuckle could
be heard, "You can't even watch yourself, I sure won't trust
you to take care of a kid…Jiraiya"</p><p>The man known as
Jiraiya stepped out from the shadows, he wore green and red clothes,
with a headband which had the kanji for 'oil'. Two red streaks
could be seen going from the man's eyes and down his cheeks, those
streaks gave of the impression that the man was crying tears of
blood. He had long white hair, spiking in every direction, and a
large scroll on his back.</p><p>Jiraiya pouted, "Well…I
could train him for some time, help him reach low chunnin level. Then
you can send him off."</p><p>"That might work,
we'll talk to him tomorrow. Be here at 9a.m sharp."</p><p>"Ya, whatever old
man. Research awaits." Was all he said, before jumping out of the
window.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>It was five in the
morning, when Sarutobi woke up. After having a small breakfast, and
checking up on his nephew and grandson, he started to make his way
over to the Hokage tower. As soon as he stepped out, the cool morning
breeze hit him. He looked at his village, it was at this time, that
the true beauty of Konoha could be seen. A small village surrounded
by lush forests.</p><p>This…was paradise.</p><p>This…was what he
protected.</p><p>Not the mere reflection
it had become.</p><p>Pushing the saddening
thoughts out of his mind, he made his way to the tower. Like always,
the tower was deserted, Sarutobi could occasionally see a random ANBU
member take up his/her positions. The hokage reached the double
doors, upon doing so, his eyes widened in surprise.</p><p>There, in front of the
doors, a small boy lay asleep. A little bit of drool escaping his
mouth. The old Kage couldn't help but grin, as the said boy out his
thumb into his mouth. Offering a silent prayer to Kami for preserving
the boy's innocence, he lifted up Naruto as gently as he could and
carried him over to his office. After placing the boy on a
comfortable chair, the Hokage turned to his daily work and called an
ANBU member, by pressing a button under his large desk. Almost
immediately a knock was heard as an ANBU with a weasel mask made into
the Hokage's office.</p><p>"Ah Itachi-kun, I see
you're up working at this hour. Its nice to see such dedicated
shinobi. Would you mind fetching Jiraya for me?"</p><p>The man known as Itachi
glanced at Naruto, before bowing his head, "Hai Hokage-sama." A
second later he disappeared in a plume of ninja smoke.</p><p>Barely five minutes had
passed before Sarutobi heard his window open. The tell tale sign of
the only loyal Sannin entering his office.</p><p>"I thought you said
to come by at 9 old man, have…" whatever Jiraiya had planned to
say was lost as he watched the seven year old boy sleeping on a
chair. A ghost of a smile could be seen over his face, before it
vanished and a mask of lecherousness took its place. "I see, the
brat couldn't wait till later could he? Well just wake him up and
let's get on with it."</p><p>After waiting for the
Hokage to make some sort of move, Jiraiya just gave up and flashed
through set of hand-seals, the water from the water cooler in a
corner rose and completely drenched Naruto.</p><p>The seven year old
boy's eyes flashed open as spluttered and let out a stream of
curses, "What the hell! Who was that?" he questioned, his eyes
finally landed on an old man with weird clothes, who was laughing
while holding his stomach.</p><p>A pair of red eyes
narrowed, "Why you…" Naruto quickly rushed and drew back his
fist, preparing to smash it in the offender's face. However, much
to his surprise, the older man easily grabbed a hold of his fist,
twisted his arm and put it behind his back. Naruto tried to struggle,
but the man twisted his arm further, making the blond boy cry out in
pain. In desperation, he raised sandaled foot and smashed it into his
captors' groin, only to find his feet come into contact with a hard
surface.</p><p>"Kid…with the
number of women who beat the shit outta me everyday, I've learnt to
protect that part of my anatomy veryyy safely"</p><p>Before Naruto could
respond, a small cough caught his attention. Twisting his head, he
saw the Sandaime chuckling, "Well Naruto, it seems it won't be
difficult to teach you how to keep yourself safe…you do it fine on
your own." Upon noticing the boy's confused expression, Jiraiya
butted into the conversation, "What sensei here means gaki, is that
for one year your going to be taught how to defend yourself. You will
be trained by me for twelve months, and based how you perform, you
will be allowed to leave the village on a <i>training</i> trip."</p><p>"Its for your best
Naruto, you know what you hold." Continued Sarutobi, " Right now
even a weak genin could easily overpower you. It would bode well for
Konoha if you are captured by an enemy nation. For you to face the
world, you have to train first. Jiraiya here, was one of my students
and is the only person in this village who can match me. Regardless
of how he behaves, he is a very good teacher, in-fact he trained the
Fourth himself. I believe that under him, you'll finally be ready
to complete your goals."</p><p>"Alright oji-san,"
conceded Naruto with a sigh, "If you want me to get stronger before
leaving, then I will. Even if it means that I have to deal with this
circus clown." He pointed towards Jiraiya, who became red with
anger.</p><p>"What do you mean
baka, I'm Jiraiya of the sannin. You're the clown here, what kind
of ninja wears <i>orange</i> of all colors. Its as if you <i>want</i>
to be killed."</p><p>"Hey! It's not my
fault that the stupid shopkeepers wouldn't let me in their shops.
I'm not exactly the most popular person around here!" panted
Naruto, his eyes glowing slightly. This sight almost made the sennin
forget his words, but he quickly recovered.</p><p>"Well that's gonna
change now. We're going shopping, and after I'm done with you,
you'll look like a proper ninja, and after that…we'll begin
your tortu…training."</p><p>The pair continued to
argue, as the older and much <i>wiser</i> Jiraiya managed to catch a
struggling Naruto in a headlock and started dragging him out through
the door. Neither of them paying any attention to their superior
sitting behind a huge desk, sporting a mega sweatdrop.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p><b>A/N: DONE!!! I want

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><p align="center"><b>A New
Look and Training Commences</b></p><p><b>Disclaimer: I don't
own Naruto or Splinter Cell. They belong to their respective owners</b></p><p>"Alright brat,"
said Jiraiya as he practically dragged Naruto in…by his feet,
"We're here. Now, go select the clothes you want to wear. But
remember, I get to have the final decision on what clothes you can
wear. Now scram!"</p><p>Naruto looked up and
read the shop's name…'Ninja Needs', he hadn't come here
before, maybe if he was lucky he'd actually get some clothes.</p><p>Muttering about old
people with weird clothing habits ordering him about clothes, he
entered the store and made his way to the clothing section of 'Ninja
Needs', a store built specifically for the basic needs of a
shinobi. But before Naruto could so much as lay a hand on something
orange, he was seen by the owner.</p><p>And the drama began…but</p><p>not in the usual manner</p><p>"You're alive!
But…but you're supposed to be dead, t-they said t-that they
killed you." But before Naruto could muster up an appropriate
defense for the inevitable attack, he was…hugged…</p><p>by woman…</p><p>who was crying…</p><p>over him…</p><p>Unwilling tears escaped
his ruby read eyes as he realized that, whoever this person was, she
cared for him. He slowly moved his hand to the woman's back to
comfort her. After a few minutes, the woman was sober enough, to
engage in a civilized conversation. "I'm sorry," muttered the
woman, "But…the villagers were going on about how they had killed
you, and I never expected you to be alive!"</p><p>Naruto for the first
time got to observe the only civilian, who he believed to be the only
villager who didn't hate him. She was…mature, he could safely
guess that she wasn't a day older than twenty seven. She had
slightly long hair, reaching up to her mid back. Her face had touch
of make-up and her honey brown eyes glistened with tears. She wore a
light blue kimono, with dark blue embroidery, which accentuated every
curve of her body. Despite her age, she was, for the lack of words,
hot!</p><p>"Ne, nee-san. Why…why
didn't you throw me out like the rest of the shopkeepers? Don't
you know about Kyuubi?" inquired Naruto.</p><p>The woman was shocked
at the boy's awareness of his tenant, but she nonetheless answered,
"That's because unlike the other villagers, I see you as someone
who keeps this village safe. You see Naruto-kun, my husband was the
Yoindaime's teammate, right from when he was gennin, to when they
both left the ANBU. The Yondaime went on to become a jounin
instructor, while my husband became a combat specialist and retired
after the war. At first I was like the others, but my husband told me
of the Yondaime's seal, and how many steps he had taken to ensure
that the Kyuubi would never break out, it is thanks to him that I
think of you as a hero, and not as the demon you hold within your
soul."</p><p>"Thank you nee-san,"
said Naruto, his resolve to be acknowledged raised to knew heights as
he saw that there were indeed some people who liked him. Just then
the 'great' Jiraiya made his presence known by entering the
store, through the window. The hermit quickly got up and dusted
himself, he then proceeded to put his telescope back into a hidden
pocket.</p><p>"Jiraiya-sama,"
said the woman, "How many times have I told you not to go peeking
on women!"</p><p>"Now now Hinamori.
You should acknowledge my greatness, I am the savior of…"
Jiraiya's lecture on his importance to the male ninja populace was
cut short by a slap on the head by an irritated Naruto, "You…you
pervert! Ero-sennin!" huffed the small brat. "Shut up gaki, I
wouldn't trust you to know the subtle art of seduction, to ensnare
a woman with merely a look, to arouse he…" this time he was
bonked on the head by Hinamori, who was sporting a small blush.</p><p>Pretending to be
distracted, Jiraiys cleared his throat and addressed Hinamori,
"Hinamori-chan can you help me get some clothes for the baka here.
I've decided to take him on as an apprentice, only for an year
though, and I want him to wear some clothes that wouldn't get him
killed."</p><p>"Of coarse Ero-sama.
Come Naruto, follow me," said Hinamori, as she gently ushered a
grinning Naruto into the clothing section, while leaving a seething
Jiraiya.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>It had been over an
hour since the old hermit had been waiting for his apprentice,</p><p>'<i>I swear I'll
kill the gaki if he comes out wearing something orange.'</i></p><p>Finally Hinamori made
her way out of the clothes section, and smiled at Jiraya, "He's
definitely going to have half of Konoha after him,"</p><p>Jiraiya looked behind
the woman, and saw Naruto making his way towards Jiraiya, he stopped
near the counter and allowed the older ninja to inspect him.</p><p>The 'new' Naruto
wore a body hugging sleeveless dark blue T-shirt, with black Cargo
pants that were tight around the thighs but loosened up as they went
down, the pants were held up by two belts. A pair of combat boots
were adorned on his feet and reached up to his shins. His hands were
covered by black bandages that went up to the elbows.</p><p>'<i>Perfect,'
</i>thought Jiraiya.</p><p>"Oy gaki…what's
with the bad-ass look. You look like a ninja wannabe."</p><p>"Yeah right
Ero-sennin, at least I don't wear a combination of green and red!"
came the retort.</p><p>"Fine, fine."
Conceded Jiraiya, not in a mood to get into a verbal spat. "How
much for this and a few spare clothes, two rolls of black ninja
bandages, two rolls of ninja wire, a kunai holster and twenty kunai
and fifteen shuriken?" he asked Hinamori, who was behind the
counter.</p><p>She quickly tallied up
the score, "It'll be ten thousand ryo." She said looking up
expectantly. Muttering under his breath about the inflation, and how
cheap things were in his generation, Jiraiya took out his check book,
wrote down the appropriate amount, and handed it over to Hinamori.</p><p>The woman took the
offered piece of paper before putting it in a drawer. She smiled at
Naruto, "My husband, Kotaru manages a weapons shop for jounin and
ANBU level ninja, its just round the corner. I don't think he'll
mind selling you some custom made kunais though, I've heard that they've been made quite popular by some ninja, visit him if you're ever in the
need of a weapon."</p><p>"Arigato
Hinamori-san," bowed Naruto, "I'll find your husband if I am in
the need something."</p><p>"Come gaki, lets get
you a haircut. Your hair is to long."</p><p>Naruto bit back a
retort, as he followed the older nin out of the shop, all the while
watching the man's long white hair blowing in the wind.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Half an hour, a few
tantrums, large amounts of killing intent and many beating later,
Naruto walked out from the barber's shop, sporting a new hairstyle.
His now slightly shorter hair, was spiked up. Unlike before when his
messy hair kept on falling into his eyes, only a single short strand
of hair fell forward, and the rest was pulled back into a
gravity defying style (think Ultimate Gohan from Dragon BallZ or
Vergil from Devil May Cry)</p><p>Both Naruto and Jiraiya
finally made their way to the training grounds. Jiraiya motioned for
Naruto to sit down. The apprentice did so, while his master sat down
opposite to him.</p><p>"Now listen to me
Naruto," began Jiraiya in a serious tone, one that surprised the
seven year old, "The Sarutobi-sensei told me about your new chakra
type, as well as what happened to you, leading to your new eyes."
At this, the mans eyes locked into the blonde's. Eyes the color of
blood, with slits for pupils, matched the gaze of a pair of midnight
black orbs. Naruto was not taken by surprise this time, he may like
to fool around, but he was exceptionally good at perceiving things,
he had to be, to survive this long. He had known that Jiraiya would
have known about everything.</p><p>Apparently satisfied
with whatever he was searching for, Jiraiya continued, "Even though
I may not understand the details, I know this, because your chakra is
not hundred percent human, you would only be able to use a select
amount of jutsus. For the most part, you would have to invent
entirely new techniques. It will be extremely useful because only you
would be able to perform these techniques, and even though they can
be copied by the Sharingan, they copy cats won't be able to use them. However, I must warn
you though, creating jutsus is extremely difficult. Many ninjas have
lost their lives, trying to control a technique above their level.
This is why our training will revolve around trying to teach you to
make your own techniques. Another important factor would be your
taijutsu training. Honestly Sandaime expects you to be at least
chunnin level at the end of the year, I expect you to be at least
high chunnin to low jounin. I will not tolerate any indiscipline.
During training you will address me as sensei. Nothing more, nothing
less. You not obeying my rules, will cause me immense <i>displeasure</i>.
Understand?"</p><p>All Naruto could do was
nod, as he pondered on the change in ero-sennin's behavior. He,
however was not given enough time as he was pulled up by Jiraiya.
"Look carefully, here are the seals used to do jutsu. Remember them,
and commit them to memory. Practice them until you can do them in any
order." Without further delay, Jiraiya showed him the various
seals. Ram, snake, rabbit and dog being the most common.
"We will meet here again tomorrow at nine. Don't be late, and
practice the seals. I expect you to be at least proficient in them, and you should
be able to complete all seals in any order in no more than three
seconds. Dismissed." And with that, the toad hermit made his way to
the Hokage tower, leaving behind a stunned seven year old, thinking
just one thing…</p><p><i>hungry, food,

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><p align="center"><b>Training
II</b></p><p><b>Disclaimer: I don't
own Naruto or Splinter Cell. They belong to their respective owners</b></p><p>That night Naruto
stayed up and practiced the various seals, until he could do them in
any order. Even though he had been practicing for three hours, he
still couldn't complete the entire series in three seconds. His
best time was five seconds, and even then he had missed out on the
snake and tiger seals. With a sigh Naruto went his small kitchen and
quietly took out a pack of instant ramen. He put the ramen in boiling
water and then put the necessary spices and vegetables. Once the
ramen was done, he transferred the contents into a bowl and took out
a pair of chopsticks. He searched for a place to sit down and eat,
but the entire apartment was filled with training equipment and books
on chakra.</p><p>Shaking his head at his
own dirtiness, Naruto made his way to the roof. Sitting cross-legged
he put the steaming bowl in front of him, and took a sip of the
broth. He broke the chopsticks and started eating his ramen. This was
the best part about night, no one's awake, so Naruto could be at
piece. It was a nice break from all the shouting and the glares he
received. His mind slowly drifted to the woman in the Ninja store,
and a small smile could be seen forming on the boy's face. Someone
acknowledged him, and not only that, for the first time, they let him
shop.</p><p>Naruto had seen the
looks that he had received from some of the villagers. They were of
barely concealed awe, that is, until they saw his whisker marks and
adopted their patented 'I hate Naruto' glare. He looked at the
empty ramen bowl in front him, and decided to continue train…</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>"Dammit!!!" the cry
was heard throughout the small unkept apartment.</p><p>"Stupid stupid seals.
I hate you!" said Naruto, while looking at his tired wrists.
Throughout the night he had been making the seals. What he didn't
understand was that how he could ANY normal shinobi make twelve seals
within three seconds! He looked at his alarm clock, 5:05am, the time
was shown in bright red. The first rays of sunlight could be seen on
the horizon, bathing the sky in orange light. Once again Naruto reset
the stopwatch and stared making the necessary seals…his hands
flashed through various different symbols in fractions of a second.
Done!</p><p>Naruto stopped the
stopwatch and looked at the time – 4.02 seconds. "Damn you
Ero-sennin!" he cried and once again got to work. It was around
8:30 that Naruto finally completed his objective. He blared through
twelve seals in three seconds. Grinning proudly he looked at the
watch…8:50</p><p>BAAMM! The entire
building shuddered as a massive facevault shook the complex…which
was followed by a scream of "SHIT!! I'M LATE!!" Without taking
a bath or even brushing his teeth, Naruto banged open the door and
ignoring the curses from his landlord, he ran full speed to the
training fields.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>"Ooooohhh"</p><p>"hee hee hee…"</p><p>"That's good!"</p><p>"Wow! Look. At.
that!"</p><p>Jiraiya was currently
sitting on a tree branch with his trusted telescope in his hand. This
particular bathhouse belonged to the Uchiha clan, this particular
clan was feared by the entire shinobi world. But what they didn't
know was that, the woman of the Uchiha clan were…lets say…well
endowed. Carefully Jiraiya shifted his position to allow more comfort
as he saw Uchiha Mikoto enter the bathhouse. Even when Jiraiya was a
Jounin he had always had the hots for Mikoto, a young chuunin, and to
watch the wife of the clan head, nude…made his day. His musings
however were cut short as a cry of "SHIT!! I'M LATE!!" was
heard all over Konoha. It caused all the woman to look towards the
source, which just happened to be from the direction where Jiraiya
was hidden. Faster than the eye could track, a multitude of Sharingan
wielding eyes narrowed in fury.</p><p>"he he. Bye," was
all they heard before Jiraiya disappeared in a whirl of leaves, and
appeared before a short, blond brat, casusing the said brat to
collide with him and fall on his ass.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>"Ow!" was all
Naruto could manage, it felt as if he had hit a brick wall. Naruto
looked up and saw Ero-sennin stuffing a telescope in his jacket.</p><p>"Hey gaki." Was all
he said before Naruto found himself being lift up and be carried by
the huge man. Not more than five minutes later, the student and
teacher found themselves in a clearing with three wooden posts and a
large pond.</p><p>"Now gaki, I hope
that you did the task I assigned you yesterday, because if you havn't
then, there's no point in continuing today."</p><p>"You better believe
it pervert! I did it. I can do all the hand seals in any order in
less than three seconds…" Naruto continued to ramble, completely
ignoring his teacher making taking out a kunai and making seals with
a look of anger on his face. "…and I can't wait for you to
check me!" During the end of the long speech, Jiraiya finally
finished his rather long sequence of seals and swiftly placed the
kunai on Naruto's back.</p><p>Naruto's eyes bugged
out as he landed on his knees first and then fell face first, sending
a large dust cloud into the air. "I told you gaki to call me
sensei. What I did was put you under a gravity field. The kunai on
your back is the conduct for that. Now normally, a person would die
if he is placed under a gravity field for more than a week. But
thanks to the Kyuubi being inside you, you should have no problems.
Right now the setting is at two times normal gravity. Each time you
disobey me I'll increase the setting by 1.5X. As for your
assignment, I already know that you can do it, and I'm proud of
you. I had planned on teaching you taijutsu and some theory today,
BUT you decided that you needed body conditioning. So your assignment
for the next week is…to live." And with that Jiraiya quickly
left, leaving a struggling Naruto.</p><p>It was late in the
afternoon when Naruto finally managed to get halfway to his
apartment. On the way various villagers had taken the advantage of
his handicapped status to pass remarks at him.</p><p>'<i>Dammit! My body
feels so heavy! It a pain to even breath! Well atleast the villagers
aren't hitting me anymore.'</i> Was all Naruto could think as he
made his way to his apartment. With shaking hands he managed to push
open the door and set a trembling foot inside. No sooner had he
closed the door behind him, that he fell down on the ground, asleep
from exhaustion.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>The early rays of light
made its way into the apartment and lit up a small room. Naruto
reluctantly opened his eyes as the events of the last day made there
way into his mind. Cursing ero-sennin, he tried to stand up and make
his way to the bathroom, only to fall back down. After umpteen number
of tries he finally managed to make his wayto the bathroom, after a
cold shower he returned to his drawing/bedroom. After a quick
breakfast of fruits and eggs he saw a scroll on his bed. Trudging
towards his bed Naruto opened the scroll, and saw some instructions.</p><p>'<i>Channel your
chakra into the paper to find scrolls on a tai-jutsu style. I expect
you to know the theory by next week. If you fail then I'll double
your gravity.'</i></p><p>Without another word
Naruto channeled some chakra into the scroll. With a small poof,
three scrolls replaced the earlier one. Opening the first scroll,
Naruto read – Muay Thai.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>The week passed with
Naruto getting used to the high gravity and learning the various
stances, and how to use his shins and elbows in a fight. Needless to
say, at the end of the week Naruto had grasped the basics of the
style. On the last day, he was shaken out of his sleep by cold water.</p><p>"What the hell!
Er-Jiraiya sensei!" he caught himself, shuddering at the thought of
extra gravity.</p><p>"I see that your
learning gaki. Frankly I never thought that you'd have adjusted to
the high gravity so quickly, <i>and</i> you even got the basics."
Said Jiraiya in a n amused tone, "be at the training grounds in an
hour. Don't be late." And with that he disappeared in a poof.</p><p>The passing hour saw a
blond blue wearing ninja wannabe racing through the crowded streets,
dodging people and jumping over trading carts. Panting heavily, he
made his way to the training grounds to see…no one.</p><p>Out of the blue he was
hit by a fist, Naruto went sailing and crashed into a tree, with a
little shake of his head he cleared his head, only to find another
fist smash him into a tree. This time however he quickly got up and
took a look at his attacker. Without wasting a second Jiraiya was
upon him, sending kicks, bunches, jabs. It took all of Naruto's
concentration to avoid the blows, and even then he was avoiding them
only by fractions of seconds.</p><p>'<i>There' </i>A
pause in the attack was all that it took for Naruto to take charge.
He pulled all his strength behind his punch and sent it sailing
towards Jiraiya, only to find it blocked.</p><p>"That actually stung
a little brat. Being the baka you are, I don't think you realized
how a nobody like you was actually evading my attacks." Upon seeing
the look of confusion on the brat, he continued, "It was because I
removed the gravity field, you didn't even notice the damn kunai
fall from your back! Anyway…I want you to go over there and punch
that tree." With a nod, Naruto ran to a tree and with all his force
smashed his fist into the bark of a tree… "Owww…that hurt. What
did you make me do that for…baka," the last part was said in a
whisper.</p><p>"I heard that!"</p><p>"Damn…dog ears."</p><p>"Your pushing it now
bakayaro."</p><p>"humph!!"</p><p>"Now if your finished
with your childish insults, look at the place you hit." Without a
doubt that tree had a fist shaped indentation on it. "SUGOI!! Hell
ya! I'm the strongest."</p><p>"Shut up brat…your
pathetic…watch."</p><p>Calmly the white haired
pervert walked over to another tree, and slammed his fist into the
bark, with a loud crack, wood splintered. Almost splintering the tree
into two. Jiraiya turned back to his wide eyed student, "this is
strength kid, and when I'm done with you…It'll pail in
comparison to yours."</p><p>At not getting the kind
of response he wanted, the sensei inspected Naruto, the boy was
looking at the tree with wide eyes, he slowly turned to face Jiraiya,
and with a look that startled the older man, he said,</p><p>"Teach me."</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</b>(1month later) <b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>"Ichi, Ni, San, Shi,
Go, Roku, Shichi, Hachi Kyuu, Jyu, Jyuichi…" chanted Naruto as he
did pushups with 2X the normal gravity.</p><p>Jiraiya had explained
to him that for the first six months they would be concentrating on
pure tai-jutsu. Ninjutsu and ninjutsy creation would be taught after
the tai-jutsu training was completed. That however didn't deter our
blond hero from finding different ways to manipulate his chakra. He
found that he could replicate one of the Nara clan's jutsu without
handseals. They called it the kagemane, he called it…nothing.
Really, it was hard to find cool names for jutsus.</p><p>Jiraiya had taught him
basic academy jutsus such ad the kwarimi and the bunshin, the latter
however he just couldn't do no matter what. Nevertheless our blond
hero didn't lose hope and continued his training. Ever since that
day when Jiraiya had told him that he'd make Naruto strong, Naruto
had worked his ass of to complete each and every task that his
perverted master set for him.</p><p>Naruto had to hand it
to him, the pervert was an excellent teacher…when he wasn;t peaking
that is.</p><p>"Gojyu…"</p><p>Naruto stood up,
completing his assigned fifty pushups and looked at his sensei
expectantly, today was the day he finally started the intermediate
work on his taijutsu style.</p><p>"Alright…now as you
know Mauy Thai is an extremely deadly and effective martial art. It
relies on your stomach, shoulder, leg and hip muscles to execute
moves as fast and as hard as possible. When you try to hit someone
with your elbow remember to twist your shoulder and hips for maximum
impact, Now go over to the training post and give me hundred elbow
thrusts with each arm."</p><p>"Ossu."</p><p>Jiraiya sighed, ever
since the training started Naruto had become serious. It didn't
mean that he still wasn't a loud mouthed idiot. Once the training
was over, he would once again become a pain in the…but the rate at
which he was growing was leaving Jiraiya with no time for research!
Big fat tears made there way in Jiraiya's eyes, as he lamented the
day he had agreed to take the boy as an apprentice…</p><p>'<i>Hmm…I heard
Tsunade is in town' </i>The tears and drooping face transformed
into a lecherous grin as he imagined those big, full and delicious
melons.</p><p>POOF</p><p>The old man could no
longer be seen…but the villagers would swear for years to come that
they heard a shrill scream like a man losing something precious to
him.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b>
(2months later) <b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Two months had passed
since Naruto had been apprenticed under Jiraiya, and over the course
of that period he had changed tremendously. Sure he still visited his
oji-san and had ramen, but only on weekends, for that perverted
bastard had forbidden Naruto to have ramen everyday, saying that it
stunted his growth…like hell. Anyway, Naruto had almost finished
learning Muay Thai and ero-sennin had given him some scrolls on
another tai-jutsu form, called Karate. An extremely fast style that
was based on punches kicks and blocks and a good deal of evasion.</p><p>It was infact Naruto
who had asked Jiraiya for the Karate scroll. He felt that only using
elbows, shins and knees limited him. But with combining Muay Thai
with Karate he would be able to use all of his limbs and joints, thus
surprising the enemy with each new move.</p><p>Jiraiya had also taught
Naruto a jutsu called Kage Bunshin, unlike the regular bunshin, the
kage bunshin was a solid clone that could fight back and even had its
own chakra system, however one solid hit would dispel it. But the
thing to be noted about this technique was that it transferred all
that it learnt during its 'life' to its master. The technique had
helped Naruto in finding flaws in hi style. He would spar with his
Kage Bunshin and when it was dispelled, Naruto would gain information
about the weaknesses in his style. It was only because of this
technique that Naruto was able to master Muay Thai. However because
of his unnatural chakra, he could only produce up to ten clones. If
he tried to make more, the chakra would simply go to waste.</p><p>Also Naruto had learnt
a great deal about handseals. He remembered one of his evening
lessons with Jiraiya…</p><p align="center"><i>-Flashback-</i></p><p>"Now gaki, since your
developing so fast, I've got a reward for you…A lesson on
handseals. Now don't make that face, I had originally planned to
tell you this when you finished your Tai-Jutsu training, but I guess
I can give you a preview now. You see if there were only twelve
handseals, then the total amount of Jutsu would be limited, but in
order to create a jutsu you often have to create handseals. Handseals
are generally used to help in the correct flow of chakra. It means
that Jutsus can be done without seals, however it takes a lot of
concentration and effort to do so. Watch…"</p><p>Jiraiya got up from the
ground and walked to an open area. He closed his eyes and his brows
furrowed, after what seemed to be a minute he opened his eyes and
said,</p><p><i>Underworld Spines</i></p><p>Immediately Jiraiya's
hair lengthened and hardened, while covering his entire body and
forming an ultimate defense. "As you can see brat," I can do this
jutsu without seals but it took me months to practice, and even then
I still can't use it in battle.</p><p>"There are various
ninjutsu specialists who are known to make entirely new handeals to
make amazingly powerful jutsu. One such ninja is Hatake Kakashi."</p><p align="center"><i>-Flashback
end-</i></p><p>That was all it took to
motivate Naruto to start his own pet project.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b>
(3months later) <b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>With the help of Kage
bunshins, Naruto had finally mastered Karate and successfully merged
both Muay Thai and Karate into well balanced Tai-jutsu style. His
birthday came and went during this period and he received two gifts.
From the old pervert he received a scroll on how to increase the
Gravity field around the Kunai, and from old man hokage Naruto
received twenty coupons for free ramen, there's no point in
mentioning that Jiraiya's scroll lay forgotten for many weeks.</p><p>In a fair fight Naruto
could now hold his own against Jiraiya, however the figths were
rarely fair, as the older teacher would use Kage bunshins to ambush
Naruto the moment the boy let his hair down, while restricting the
boy from using chakra.</p><p>It was also during this
period that Naruto started noticing a major problem with his chakra.
No matter how much he tried controlling it, he would always end up
wasting precious amounts of stamina. When he mentioned this to
Jiraiya, they could only come up with a solution that the heavy body
training and lack of mental stimulation had caused Naruto's chakra
to losing the delicate balance between physical and mental energy.</p><p>To remedy this
situation Naruto started meditating for one hour every night before
sleeping, and in the mornings he would study scrolls about the
history of Konoha along with subjects like physics and anatomy. The
meditation helped Naruto clear his mind and think clearly, while the
scrolls on anatomy helped him target the various pressure points and
vital areas in a body, to effectively disable, knock out or eliminate
and opponent. The study on anatomy was done without the knowledge of
his teacher.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b>(4months
later)<b> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Once again Naruto
surpassed Jiraiya's expectations by completing his tai-jutsu
training in four months. With constant sparring against his kage
bunshins Naruto had improved his tai-jutsu to a point where he could
easily hold his own against Jiraiya, even with the pervert using
jutsu. At the age of eight, Naruto could be called a tai-jutsu
master….</p><p>He had even regained
control over his chakra. Through constant practice, Naruto could now
meld into shadows within seconds. He could even use shadows to
transport himself. He had beaten Ero-sennin when they had been
sparring in the evening, and he had melded into the shadows, came out
behind Jiraiya and hit him at a pressure point to knock the sennin
unconscious. After that however Naruto's training had gotten
harder, as Jiraiya started going all out and forced him to spar while
under the gravity field. He said it was for when Naruto couldn't
remove the field during a fight in time. Naruto however felt that the
pervert just wanted revenge.</p><p>Jiraiya had also
started to teach him jutsus. Currently Naruto's jutsu library held
five jutsus – Kawarimi, Kage Bunshin, kagemane, Fuuton: Renkudan
and Underworld Spines.</p><p>The last was the
personal jutsu of Jiraiya and a high B-Class jutsu. All of the
jutsus, except kawarimi and kage bunshin were high B-Class jutsus and
had taken weeks to learn, even with ten kage bunshins.</p><p>Another thing that they
started working on was elemental manipulation. Jiraiya had informed
him that through extreme training some jounin could actually control
the element with which their chakra was aligned to. It was nothing
major, but the Nidaime was rumored to have mastered his water
manipulation so well that he could actually pull the water vapor from
the air. Unfortunately for Naruto, his lack of chakra control became
obvious when he had completed the first exercise of cutting a leaf
into two using just raw chakra.</p><p>When he had progressed
onto cutting a water fall into two, there had been a small problem of
him not being able to stand on water. This had lead to extensive
chakra control exercises, like tree climbing and water walking.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b>
(5months later) <b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>5 months had gone by
since Naruto had begun his training, it could be said that that the
eight year old was equal to a low chuunin. The only thing inhibiting
the brat was his lack of knowledge in ninjutsu, genjutsu and battle
experience. He was no prodigy however; all his accomplishments were a
result of his hard work and regeneration factor.</p><p>In this month Jiraiya
had made Naruto concentrate on his chakra control. He had informed
the gaki that for his chakra control to be in top shape, Naruto had
to practice all the exercises every month. The pervert was
unforgiving during his training. He had made Naruto climb trees
without hands, this include walking, running, hopping and skipping on
trees! Even with ten clones working throughout the day Naruto had
managed to grasp the training after a week, but it didn't end
here…nooooo…they had moved on to water walking, where Naruto had
to stand in hot scalding water for hours on end, and when he had
finally mastered that; he had been ordered by his taskmaster to do
all of his daily warm up exercises, while standing on the water!</p><p>Nonetheless Naruto's
chakra control had shot through the roof, and Naruto could feel the
difference when he used his jutsu. No longer he felt like he was
wasting chakra. Each jutsu carried just the right amount of chakra.
No more, no less than the required amount.</p><p>He couldn't wait to
get back to mastering his wind element.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b>
(6months later) <b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX </b></p><p>Finally Naruto had
managed to become at least proficient in using the wind element. He
was no means a master, he could not control wind in its natural form,
BUT he could use his chakra to form cutting winds around his daggers
that could cut through both tree and stone. He had bought the daggers
from the Ninja Store run my Hinamori's husband, Ichigo. It had
taken a lot of pleading and buttering before the man had reluctantly
let Naruto buy a pair of twin daggers. The daggers itself were not
fancy or anything, They had a firm and comfortable grip which was
eight inches in length. The blade was made so as it didn't reflect
any light, it was slightly serrated and was fifteen inches in length.
The entire dagger was twenty four inches long. It was slightly bigger
than necessary but it would be perfect for Naruto when his height
increased. The best part about it however, was that it elemental
chakra could be channeled through the hilt into the blade, diving the
blade the properties of the chakra.</p><p>Naruto was training
with his blades from a scroll he had received, courtesy the hokage,
when he was interrupted by Jiraiya and Sarutobi.</p><p>"Oy gaki come over
here?!" shouted the deranged pervert, shaking his head Naruto
sheathed his blades at his thighs and made his way towards his
teacher, "Old man, pervert." He said, while bowing to each. Not
missing the looks of amusement and fury he was receiving.</p><p>"Jiraiya tells that
you've been growing strong Naruto-kun. That's why we have a test
for you. You will be fighting Maito Gai, he is a jounin specializing
in tai-jutsu, your task is to defeat him." Said Sarutobi, taking a
long draught of his pipe, "He will be here shortly."</p><p>As if on cue a man
wearing dark green spandex made his way to the training grounds,
"YOSH!! OHAYO HOKAGE-SAMA, JIRAIYA-SAMA, TELL ME WHO WILL I BE
FIGHTING?"</p><p>'<i>Kami, can this
guy get any louder?' </i> were the common thoughts of the other
three listeners. Sarutobi removed a hand from his ears and pointed
towards Naruto. "YOSH! I WILL PROVE MY FLAMES OF YOUTH BY DEFEATING
YOU LITTLE MAN, PREPARE TO LOSE!!"</p><p>And with that the weird
spandex wearing ninja got into a stance of what seemed to be the
style, 'Iron Fist', without waiting further he charged at Naruto,
throwing punches and kicks faster than the eye could track. It took
all of Naruto's concentration to block or evade the hits. Mentally
he cursed himself for increasing the gravity field. Right now he was
fighting at 3X normal gravity, and it showed.</p><p>Quickly Naruto evaded a
kick and jumped back, both the combatants glared at each other, "Lord
Hokage, this boy cannot keep up with me," he addressed the Hokage.
It was at that precise moment that Naruto struck, driving his knee
into the older man's chest. Gai skidded back and once again
continued his assault. This time however his speed was matched by
Naruto who continued to dodge all the attacks, while throwing out
random punches and knee thrusts, which were all blocked.</p><p>They had been going at
it for half an hour and both of them were now panting slightly from
the exertion, beads of sweat rolled down their faces, dripping onto
the earth. Both of them at the same time removed their weights and
gravity field respectively. Now while Gai gained a massive speed
burst, Naruto became even faster, his strength also increased by
three times. As they continued fighting it became apparent that
Naruto had the upper hand in the fight. With a quick leg sweep he
fell the jounin and disabled his legs by pressing his pressure
points.</p><p>"Do you yield?" He
asked,</p><p>"Hai, your flames
burn brightly Nsruto-san," said Gai, for once surprising all
present at his knowledge about Naruto's name and the lack of
shouting that normally accompanied him.</p><p>"Well done Naruto,
truly I did not expect this improvement. Gai is one of the best
tai-jutsu specialists we have and you took him out. That was at least
high jounin speed and strength you displayed." Said Sarutobi to a
blushing Naruto.</p><p>"Yeah yeah old man, I
know I'm the best! You better watch out, I'll be the strongest
ninja in the world, believe it!"</p><p>"Shut up brat,
there's a lot of difference between a jounin and a S-Class ninja,
you are nowhere near strong. When you can beat me, then you have the
right to say your strong," sad Jiraiya while hitting Naruto on the
head, "Get ready…from tomorrow we start your jutsu training."</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p><b>A/N: DONE!!! An
extremely long chapter by my usual standards, that's why it took so
long. Expect the next chapter to be equally long. I hope I didn't
make him too powerful. He is high jounin in tai-jutsu and low chuunin
in ninjutsu, in genjutsu however he knows NOTHING, he has no battle
experience. Considering all of this I'll say that Naruto's mid
chuunin. As for the daggers, they won't play a major role. I have a

Training and an Assessment</b></p><p>The seventh month of
Naruto's training had finally started and the blond had to undergo
extreme embarrassment when Jiraiya had asked him to remove all his
clothes…</p><p align="center"><i>-FLASHBACK-</i></p><p>Naruto was quietly
eating his ramen, savoring the way the dish teased his taste buds,
when he was rudely taken out of his musings by a knock. Vowing to
kill the person who disturbed his quality time, Naruto opened the
door only to see Jiraiya standing there with some ink, a brush and a
weird smile that sent chills down the boy's spine.</p><p>"Move gaki," was
all he said as the super pervert made his way into the small
apartment. After looking around for a bit he turned towards Naruto
and said just one word, "Strip."</p><p>All that the boy could
do was stare at the old man with wide eyes and an open mouth before
he realized that the pervert was actually waiting for his command to
be followed through, "What the hell are you saying you pervert!
Have you finally decided to quit on women and turn your attention
towards small boys!"</p><p><b>BAAM!</b></p><p>A blushing Jiraiya
struck Naruto on the head, "No baka gaki, I realized that it'll
hinder your movements if you had a kunai stuck on your body the
entire time you fight, so for the past few months I've developed
some seals that recreate the effect of the seals on your kunai. But
for them to be effective they must be applied to <i>every</i> part of
your body."</p><p>By the tone of the
older man, Naruto's eyes widened, he would be touched…down
there…by a man. Now Naruto was an eight year old, although he
didn't know much about the bird and the bees, he DID know that men
should not touch other men's… <i>thingy…</i>He was broken out
of trance by another command, "Now, strip."</p><p>"n-no way! I like the
kunai, I think I'll keep it. There's no way I'm gonna take my
clothes off."</p><p>"Then you leave me
with no choice," sighed Jiraiya, making handseals faster than
Naruto could see he cried out, "<i>Swamp of the Underworld</i>",
Within seconds the ground beneath Naruto's feet became like
quicksand, only it didn't pull Naruto in, but kept him trapped.
"What the hell, pervert," shouted Naruto as he blared through
handseals and shouted "<i>Underworld Spines</i>" and poured
chakra into his hair to lengthen it and so that his hair covered his
entire body, while hardening into an ultimate barrier. "Oy gaki, do
you really think you can use my own jutsu against me?" questioned
Jiraiya as he dispelled the jutsu with a burst of his chakra, "Look,
even I don't like it, but it needs to be done! It'll give you a
huge advantage in battle as your enemies won't expect you to
suddenly multiply your strength and speed by a factor of X! Now, I'm
going to release you, but promise you won't run."</p><p>Sill shivering with
disgust Naruto nodded. With another burst of chakra the jutsu binding
him was released, absently he thought, <i>I have to learn how to do
that.</i></p><p>The passing one hour
saw Naruto unsuccessfully trying to meditate as Jiraiya went about
drawing various seals on his young pupil's body.</p><p>Finally done, Jiraiya
placed his hand on Naruto's head and channeled his chakra through
the boy's hair, the seals glowed blue for a moment before they
faded into his skin.</p><p>"Done, I've reset
the gravity to 2.5X, you can increase it by making the ram seal and
focusing chakra through your entire body. Just think about the
settings you want and the seals will provide you that. The seals will
glow only when you activate or deactivate them. To deactivate them,
just concentrate your chakra near your heart and say Kai…got it."</p><p>Naruto nodded, not
meeting his sensei's eyes.</p><p>Jiraiya seeing how
uncomfortable the brat was…just exited his apartment and made a
beeline for the hot springs.</p><p align="center"><i>-FLASHBACK
END-</i></p><p>Naruto hadn't been
able to look the pervert in the eye for looong time after that.
Eventually though, the awkwardness passed and their lessons resumed
in full swing. The jutsu training however was not what Naruto had
expected, instead of him learning how to create his own jutsus, the
lessons were focused on how to manipulate the chakra through your
body and how to get the feel of the techniques being used. In short
it was all theory and Naruto just pretended to listen. It had gone
like this for a week before he felt a pull, as if his gravity field
had increased, and before long he fell on the earth with an enraged
Jiraiya standing over him, "Its 4X normal gravity for not paying
attention in class brat."</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b>
(10months later) <b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>After his gravity field
had been increased to 4X, Naruto had finally started paying attention
in classes, and found that by doing so he was finally able to
complete his pet project. He had also started working on a few jutsus
based on his shadow chakra. During this period, he had also learnt
how to detect and cancel genjutsu. With his precise chakra control
and determination, it was no problem for the brat. Even though he
couldn't use genjutsu, he could at least dispel them.</p><p>As far as his tai-jutsu
went, Naruto had kept himself in top form through sparring with
clones and working out while using chakra to stay on water. He would
wake up at eight in the morning and would practice taijutsu for two
hours. Then at twelve he would meet Jiraiya for two hours when they
had theory lectures, after that Naruto usually had lunch. Around four
he would practice creating jutsus till he was exhausted and after
that he would finally meditate and then sleep.</p><p>Naruto had also asked
Jiraiya, how he had dispelled his jutsu, before they had began their
training, in response he had gotten a laugh and 'figure it out on
your own' look. This had infuriated the boy to no ends as struggled
to grasp the concept. Another major thing that happened during
towards the end of the tenth month was when Jiraiya had wanted Naruto
to learn how to summon toads, the boy however had completely
dismissed the pervert.</p><p align="center"><i>-FLASHBACK-</i></p><p>"Enough training!
Come here gaki." Ordered Jiraiya, Naruto looked at his sensei in
confusion, before making his way towards the old man.</p><p>"Naruto I have
finally decided that your strong enough for this…I present you….the
toad summoning contract!"</p><p>"No thanks."</p><p>"Whaaa…" said
Jiraiya, after picking himself from the ground due to a massive
facevault, "How could you NOT want it! Toads are the best summons
out there!" he exclaimed.</p><p>"Not interested
per-sensei," said Naruto as he corrected himself, he <i>really</i>
did not want and increase in his gravity field, "Toads are weak."</p><p>"All right brat, I'll
summon a toad and if you can beat him then you don't have to sign
the contract. But if my summon wins then you'll have your gravity
field increased to 5X and you'll have to sign the contract…Agreed?"</p><p>"All right…" what
Naruto had not counted on, was the size of the toad Jiraiya would
summon.</p><p>With a cry of <i>Summoning
no Jutsu</i> the entire training grounds was filled with smoke, and
from that smoke, arose the 100 feet tall figure of Gamabunta, the
toad boss.</p><p align="center"><i>-Jiraiya
POV-</i></p><p>"<b>Why have you
summoned by Jiraiya?" </b>the toad's voice resonated throughout
the grounds, and Jiraiya who was standing on Gamabunta's head with
a smirk, jumped in front of his eyes and said, "Shut your trap
bunta, I've chosen that kid over there to be your next summoner,
but he doesn't feel that toads are <i>strong</i> enough, he has
also agreed to a match with a summon of my choosing. If you win, he
will be your underling, if he wins…well you're stuck with me!"</p><p>"<b>The way you put
it brat, I'm tempted to lose on purpose, but I think I'll show
this pipsqueak the power of toad summons. Come little brat, we fight"</b></p><p>"You would do well
not to underestimate the kid bunta." And with those last words of
caution Jiraiya leapt from in front of the toad's eyes and cleared
some good distance, before seating himself on a tree branch to watch,
what he believed to be an impressive but quick fight.</p><p align="center"><i>-Normal
POV-</i></p><p>"Ohh crap!!" was
all Naruto managed to say before the giant toad took a huge leap and
crashed into the place where Naruto had been standing moments before.</p><p>'<i>Damn that's a
big toad…from what I remember, summoned beings are connected to
their summoner, if their summoner is killed or knocked out they
vanish. But according to the deal, I have to fight Gamabunta…he's
big…too big, that means he'll probably be slow'</i> thought
Naruto before he was forced to dodge a series of slashes from the
toad boss' dagger, '<i>well that's it for the slow theory, but
he still can't turn fast enough and he's not agile enough. I'll
have to use that to my advantage.'</i></p><p>Without wasting a
second, the blond demon vessel formed the Kai handseal and released
the gravity field around him, feeling considerably lighter, he used
his chakra to meld into the shadow of the tree.</p><p>"<b>Oy brat?! Where
are you? Come out and face me!!" </b>yelled Gamabunta, <b>"What
the hell!!" </b>he exclaimed as Naruto emerged from the toad's
shadow between his huge legs, using a massive leg as a platform, he
jumped and launched a punch straight at the boss' groin. Quickly
teleporting out, Naruto watched the massive toad boss fall down on
the ground moaning. Trying to press his advantage, Naruto dashed
forward at inhuman speeds and jumped, hoping to land at the toad's
head. Instead he was caught in mid air, by a rather wet tongue and
thrown halfway across the training grounds.</p><p>Naruto managed to break
his fall by grabbing hold of tree branch and swinging himself so that
he was sitting on it.</p><p>'<i>Let's see,
kunai will obviously not hurt him, the same goes for shuriken. The
only things I'm left with are explosion notes, my speed and
strength. But I need him to stay in one place so that I can plant the
explosive notes, and then I have to get out in time…yes, that's
it!!' </i>and with that Naruto jumped down, still hidden from the
toad's eyes Naruto formed the seals for kagemane, except that he
whispered, "Shadow Style: Shadow Entrapment Jutsu," molding his
chakra in a pattern different from the traditional kagemane, he
released his chakra. Almost immediately the toad boss stopped his
search as he struggled against invisible bindings. The vast shadow of
Gamabunta had collapsed and collected near his feet, while chains
made out of shadow bound his legs.</p><p>"<b>What jutsu is
this brat? Release me now!" </b>demanded the toad.</p><p>His work done, Naruto
took out and explosive note and teleported himself near one of
Gamabunta's legs. He missed the slight widening of the toads eyes,
before Naruto could plant the explosive note he was pushed back by an
enormous chakra burst, the lapse in concentration caused his jutsu to
fall. Without wasting a second, Gamabunta jumped in the air and
shouted, "<i>Suiton: Renkuudan.</i>" With his super speed, it was
childs play for Naruto to evade the water cannonballs. <i>'Damn it!
He's too large!'</i> Naruto continued to evade the toad, who was
now slashing in the blonds direction using his rather long dagger.</p><p>The hot afternoon sun
slowly started sinking, making the shadow's lengthen. With a small
smirk, Naruto sent some chakra into his eyes, which started glowing.
Immediately the world became much brighter. The battle had been going
on for three ours now, and Naruto had developed a grudging respect
for the toad boss. Both of them were panting heavily, Gamabunta's
dagger had been broken into two when Naruto had punched it, and one
of Naruto's own dagger was lost. The constant attacking and evading
had tired both combatants.</p><p>Both boy and summon
were low on chakra, if the toad wasn't defeated soon, Naruto would
lose. Unknown to him, the same thoughts were going through
Gamabunta's mind…</p><p>Without any indication,
Naruto disappeared, and appeared behind the toad's head, ready to
deliver a crushing axe-kick. However at the last moment his blow was
intercepted by a webbed hand. A sound of breaking bone was heard
throughout the darkening grounds as Gamabunta shouted in pain, his
right hand broken.</p><p>Naruto however pressed
on and disappeared in the shadows, only to reappear in front of
Bunta. Crouching down, Naruto swept the toad boss' right leg, and
with a thundering noise, the massive toad fell on the ground. Not
wasting another moment, Naruto had the huge toad trapped in his
jutsu.</p><p>"Give up Gama-san."
Said Naruto, "You're a strong fighter, but night is my element.
You can not win."</p><p>"<b>Shut up brat, I
still have chakra left. NO ONE call toads weak."</b></p><p>"Yes yes, I called
you weak but that was before I met you. You are strong I admit, now
give up…"</p><p>Sensing defeat, the
toad boss said, <b>"Humphh…you're good kid, not even the fourth
had managed to beat me, and your still a tadpole…I give up." </b>And
with that, the toad was gone in a plume of smoke. With a sigh, Naruto
collapsed on the ground, only to find himself supported by Jiraiya,</p><p>"You did great
Naruto," he said in a surprisingly normal tone, "You don't have
to</p><p>summon toads,"</p><p>"hehe…about that, I
think that the toads are strong, I only said that they were weak to
piss you off." Lied Naruto, "I'll be honored to summon them."
He finished, while scratching the back of his head.</p><p>"Why you…"
forming a few handseals, Jiraiya reactivated the gravity field. The
strain that the fight took on Naruto's body, coupled with the
strain of the gravity field finally put him unconscious.</p><p align="center"><i>-FLASHBACK
END-</i></p><p>Naruto had awoken three
days later with a huge scroll near him, after examining the scroll
and finding it to be the summoning scroll for toads, Naruto eagerly
signed it in blood. He also found a small note,</p><p><i>Oy gaki, </i></p><p><i>From now on you're
the new holder of the toad contract, you can allow ONLY your future
family members or an apprentice to sign it. It is also your job to
safeguard it. You have the next three days off to gain back your
strength, after that you have to report at the Nara clan compound for
your further training.</i></p><p><i>Jiraiya </i><i><b>sensei</b></i></p><p>And so with that, the
final stages of Naruto's apprenticeship began.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
</b>(12months later)<b> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>For the last two
months, Naruto trained with the Nara clan. It turned out, that
Jiraiya had struck a deal with Nara Shikato, the clan head. He had
told him about Naruto's chakra type and his unique jutsus. Naruto,
knowing the Nara clan to be brilliant strategists agreed, he spent
two months living with the Nara clan, the entire mornings and
afternoon he would be drilled on how he manipulated chakra and used
his jutsus by some weird old men, he would then spend the rest of the
day either training on his own, or learning strategy from Nara
Shikato himself. During this time Naruto had made friends with Nara
Shikamaru, the clan heir and a rather lazy guy. They would often
compete with each other at shogi and go, challenging the other to
form extremely elaborate strategies. It was also during this period
that Naruto had developed a music interest. He was training near the
forest of death late at night, when he had heard a beautiful yet sand
tune drifting from the forest, it had moved the young boy and brought
him to tears, it was filled with pain, betrayal and sadness. Naruto
had not searched for the player for the fear of having him or her
stop playing. Pretty soon, Naruto had started visiting the forest at
night, only to hear that tune.</p><p>A few days later, the
blond had bought a flute and started teaching himself how to play the
instrument. He found that the best way to produce true music was to
put his emotions into what you played, after practicing with his Kage
bunshins for weeks, Naruto had become quite proficient. He would play
alongside the mysterious person at night, all the while making the
villagers guess the origin of the music. Naruto had heard rumors of
villagers staying up late at night, only to hear the harmonious
melody drifting from the forest, but knowing the loose jawed Konoha
women, he dismissed them</p><p>During these two
months, Naruto had not seen hide or hair of the pervert, even when he
asked about Jiraiya from the hokage, he wouldn't get an answer.
Also during this time, Naruto had increased his gravity to 4.5X, at
the age of eight he believed that he had surpassed Jiraiya in terms
of speed and strength. In the fields of ninjutsu, Naruto had invented
and added two more jutsus to his arsenal, he could now also use a
genjutsu, which was of low B rank.</p><p>After an accident while
training with his clones, Naruto had incorporated his little pet
projects into his taijutsu style, making it extremely deadly. He had
no doubt that he could beat the pervert in a tai-jutsu only battle.
Also in his free time, the little blond had taken up sealing, he did
not want to become a seal master like the Yondaime, but be
knowledgeable enough to at least store his items in seals. After a
lot of hard work and devotion, Naruto had managed to seal his large
summoning scroll into a smaller scroll, which was much easier to
carry.</p><p>It was during the last
day of Naruto's training that he received a summons from the
Hokage. The old man had informed Naruto to be at the training ground,
which he used in half an hour, ready for battle.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>This was how we find
our hero, observing his surroundings. He had on his blue sleeveless
t-shirt, black cargos, and black combat boots on, two large daggers
were strapped to his thighs (he had replaced the one he lost), two
battle kunais strapped to his forearms, over the bandages that
covered his arms.</p><p>A slight shift in the
air was all that alerted Naruto before he dodged a series of kicks
and punches sent by non other than Jiraiya, before Naruto could
inquire about the ninja's absence, Jiraiya said, "All right gaki,
show me what you got…no holds barred."</p><p>And with that…the
fight began.</p><p>Immediately Naruto was
forced to dodge a couple of fire balls courtesy the old pervert,
moving on to the offensive, he started a series of blows, involving
punches, kicks, knee thrusts and elbow thrusts. Jiraiya managed to
avoid all of them, except the last knee thrust to his solar plexus,
launching the old man twenty meters back,</p><p>"You've grown
strong brat, if I hadn't intercepted that last blow, the battle
would have been over. I think I may have to get serious after all."
And with that Jiraiya made a the standard release seal and yelled,
"Kai" nothing happened,. Smirking, Jiraiya vanished, and
reappeared behind Naruto, punching him…hard, but instead of the
yell of pain as he had expected, Jiraiya was awarded with splinters
from an obliterated log.</p><p>'<i>A Kawarimi
without seals, how much have you grown Naruto?' </i></p><p>"How did you get that
fast?" inquired Naruto.</p><p>"Look underneath the
underneath brat, weighted clothes, I'd say we are about equal in
strength,"</p><p>"What about speed?"</p><p>Naruto was rewarded
with a smirk, before Jiraiya rushed at him…quickly releasing his
gravity field, Naruto dodged, "I'm faster" said the apprentice.</p><p>"Kage Bunshin!"
cried Naruto, forming one shadow clone, "You cannot beat me!"</p><p>With that both Naruto's
launched their attack at Jiraiya, after some time, Jiraiya actually
managed to hit one of the Narutos only to find the clone become a
black mass and his had shot through, thoroughly surprised, he failed
to react in time to the kick sent his way by the real Naruto, only a
quick kawarimi managed to save him from a week of hospitalization.</p><p>"How do you like my
new taijutsu style, Shadow Fist! Like I said pervert…you'll
lose."</p><p>"Like hell brat, you
caught me off-guard, let's see how your style measures up to
mine...Underworld Spines." Jiraiya's hair hardened and covered
his entire body leaving only the face, hands and feet as they were.
He charged at the brat once again. Now no longer able to land any
hits on the powerful shinobi, Naruto was forced to dodge, and resort
to mid range attacks. Quickly Naruto took out one of his scroll from
his back pouch, pricked his finger and smeared some blood over the
scroll while launching it towards Jiraiya. A dozen kunai sped towards
Jiraiya, however before they could reach their target, a shout of
"<i>Kage Kunai no Jutsu"</i> was heard, and the twenty kunai
multiplied into two hundred. Due to the incoming barrage, Jiraiya was
forced to jump back and curl into a small ball, the kunai merely
bounced from the hard spikes surrounding Jiraiya, falling on the
floor with a thud. The distraction was all that Naruto needed to
summon a toad, with a large katana in his hand.</p><p>Pointing towards
Jiraiya, the toad jumped into action, slashing away the spiked shell
with expert moves. After a few minutes the toad was dispelled by a
blow from a now spikeless Jiraiya. "Katon: Karyuu Endan" shouted
the sennin, shooting a huge dragon made out of fire at the blond.
Upon seeing the huge dragon, Naruto dispelled his clone, and merged
with his own shadow, emerging in the forest. He quickly set to work,
building traps and digging small pit holes with the help of his
clones. After half an hour he had finished his work, and teleported
back to the clearing where Jiraiya was sitting cross-legged,</p><p>"So…you came back,
I was about to go research."</p><p>Not dignifying the
pervert with a response, Naruto muttered, "Fuuton: Renkuudan" and
shot four balls of highly compressed air from his mouth, the first
two were dodged, however the third managed to knick the pervert,
while the fourth hit him in the chest. Wiping some blood from his
mouth, Jiraiya grinned launched into an attack. Not giving Naruto the
time to call another Bunshin, Naruto however, let Jiraiya continue
his assault as he slowly guided the pervert into the forest canopy.
Once inside the darkened forest, with little sunlight, Naruto
activated his eyes and immediately captured Jiraiya in his jutsu.</p><p>"This jutsu didn't
stop Bunta, how can it stop me!"</p><p>"Simple, my jutsu
requires less chakra and has more power when there are a lot of
shadows near me, and right now…you're in my territory. Give up
sensei."</p><p>"Don't get cocky
brat…" whatever Jiraiya was going to say was cut off by a Naruto
announcing, "<i>Shadow Style: Shadow Spikes</i>."</p><p>The log was impaled by
a dozen spikes made out of shadow, Naruto smirked, his plan was
successful.</p><p>Walking over to where
Naruto sensed Jiraiya, he found the Hokage watching a tightly bound
Jiraiya with unveiled amusements. The pervert was covered entirely
with black ropes, that left only the perverts nose, eyes and hair
free.</p><p>"Well done
Naruto-kun," said Sarutobi, "You surpassed all our expectations,
now why don't you release Jiraiya, then we'll explain all this."
He added upon seeing the confused face of the boy. With a nod Naruto
cut the ropes, with his dagger.</p><p>"Now what was with
all the attacks?" questioned the blond.</p><p>"Well Naruto…you
see, Jiraiya convinced me that you were jounin level, frankly that
was a bit hard to believe as the last youngest person who reached
jounin level was Uchiha Itachi at age ten. Therefore Jiraiya
convinced me to test your abilities, on the condition that if you
matched by expectations, you'd be inducted into the Jounin ranks.
After careful monitoring and deliberation I consented."</p><p>Sarutobi stopped a
moment to gather his breath, and continued, "It pleases me to say
that Naruto-kun, you are easily mid-jounin level. The only thing you
lack is battle experience and ninjutsu techniques. I'm sure you'll
manage to rectify these things within the next four years…but I
ramble…I'm proud to award you Naruto Uzumaki the jounin rank of
Konoha and congratulate you for breaking the previous record. Meet me
tomorrow at the Hokage tower to complete the official paperwork,
until then…" he gestured to Jiraiya, who unsealed a Konoha
headband and standard custom made jounin vest and handed it to a
dumbstruck eight year old boy.</p><p>Upon seeing Naruto's
condition Sarutobi chuckled and waved his hand in goodbye, "I'll
see you in the morning Naruto-kun." With that both the S-Class
ninja vanished in smoke…leaving Naruto, who looked at the vest in
wonder, before grinning ear-to-ear and shouting…"YATTA!!! I DID
IT!!!!"</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p><b>A/N: How did you

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><p><b>Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto or Splinter Cell. They belong to their respective owners</b></p><p>To all those anonymous reviewers who feel that Naruto is either to powerful or should be sannin level: I will once <i>again</i>tell you about Naruto. He is <i>exceptional</i>in taijutsu, he beat Gai and at age eight his strength almost rivals Tsunade. He is mediocre in ninjutsu(this will change), and his genjutsu is almost non existent. He is only this powerful because of the clone and gravity training. Being under a constant gravity puts extreme pressure on not only his bones, but also on his heart, brain and lungs, making it painful for his body to function. Had it not been for Kyuubi healing him, Naruto would have been dead the first day of his training. And FINALLY why Naruto is jounin not S-Class, is because do you really think Jiraiya was going all-out on an eight year old boy. There is a thing called humanity people. If you take a look at the manga Jiraiya is a ninja who concentrates on sealing, summoning and espionage. He did not use the first two AT ALL, while Naruto HAD to use every trick up his sleeve. If you still feel that Naruto is either over powered or should be an S-Class ninja…all I have to say is don't worry. His training will go slower now that he's going to leave Konoha.</p><p>A cookie to Morcalivan7 for realizing one of the reasons why Naruto beat Gai.</p><p align="center"><b>Chapter 8: Leaving Konoha</b></p><p>The night for Naruto proved to be a peaceful one, his dreams were filled with happy villagers who surrounded the boy, giving him their good wishes. However…such dreams were not meant to last as the shrill of a battered alarm clock woke the boy up. Rising from his peaceful slumber, Naruto looked at the clock in anger before making his way over to the bathroom to get cleaned, only when the cold water touched the skin did Naruto realize what today meant. With a new spring in his step, he got ready. Ignoring his blue sleeveless t-shirt, he wore the green flack jacket over naught but his skin. He quickly wore his black cargo pants and combat boots, he then applied black bandages to his arms, which ran from his fingers to just below his elbows. After strapping the twin daggers to his thighs and using his Konoha headband as a belt, Naruto looked himself over in the mirror.</p><p>Naked muscled arms could be seen, but somehow, on an eight year old…they looked good. The dark green complimented his dark pants greatly, and after a satisfied look Naruto made his way to the old man's office.</p><p>Throughout his trek, Naruto had deal with the looks of the villagers. But they were not the looks of hatred as he had become accustomed to, they were the looks of curiosity and amazement. With a pleasant smile, the blond continued on and reached the office with lots of time to spare, because he had an appointment and the Hokage was free, he was let in early by the guards.</p><p>"Ohayo Naruto-kun. You're looking good." Said the Hokage.</p><p>"Arigato…Hokage-sama," at the raise of the Hokage's eyebrows, Naruto continued, "Now that I am your subordinate it is only fair that I refer to you as my superior." He finished with a smirk.</p><p>"Oh…if you insist Naruto-<i>san</i>. Here are your papers, once you sign them, you'll be an official ninja of Konoha. The enemies if Konoha will be your foes and Konoha's allies will be your friends. You will answer my call whenever I need you. As a jounin, you will have a right to choose your own missions. However the ones I hand out personally will be mandatory and have importance over any existing mission…now…are you sure you want to do this. This is your last chance to quit."</p><p>"I did not train the whole of last year for nothing Sarutobi oji-san. True, I did not expect to be made a jounin, but I always wanted to be a ninja. I will do what you tell me, kill whom you tell me to and protect the ones close to you. I swear my fealty…to you."</p><p>After the end of Naruto's little speech, Sarutobi could do nothing but stare, he didn't think that Naruto knew what he had just done. This was how ninjas were recruited by the Shodaime prior to the forming of Konoha. The shinobi were not loyal to any nation, but to the man to whom they gave their fealty. If Sarutobi were to leave Konoha, Naruto would have to leave to. This was a law…one of the first laws written by the Shodaime during the making of Konoha.</p><p>Without telling Naruto what he had done, Sarutobi handed him the papers, which the boy promptly signed. "When will you be leaving Naruto-kun."</p><p>"I don't know, I still have some work to do. But I think that I'll leave by nightfall."</p><p>"Very well then…you are dismissed."</p><p>With a bow, Naruto exited the Hokage tower and made for the Konoha armory. You had to be chuunin or higher to be allowed entry. It was the same place Naruto had gotten his daggers from.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>"Hey Ichigo! You got my stuff ready?" shouted Naruto as he entered the shop.</p><p>"Just a sec runt. I'll bring it out." Came the reply from the back room, Naruto took the opportunity to once again examine the shop that was the primary supplier of Konoha's military force. Of coarse there were many other shops that sold good stuff, but Ichigo's reputation as the Yondaime's teammate and a weapon specialist was what attracted shinobis to this small store.</p><p>Weapons ranging from the traditional katanas to the unorthodox bows were hanging from the walls. There were weapons of all shapes and sizes. Once or twice Naruto even noticed some weapons that were a combination of two weapons, like a sickle at the end of a long chain. On the wall behind the counter was a display of shinobi armor. Most was made of leather for fast movement, but there were also some that were made out of thin mail.</p><p>"See something you like brat?"</p><p>"You wish!" answered Naruto while switching his crimson gaze towards the owner of the shop. Ichigo was a tall man with lean muscles and bright orange hair. He often said that as a kid he was short and fat, somehow, Naruto found it hard to believe</p><p>"You got my stuff?" inquired Naruto.</p><p>"Yup, all the three things you asked for, though why you need the last one, I don't understand."</p><p>"Don't worry…you will when you meet me the next time. Now hand them over." With a sigh, Ichigo handed over the said items to Naruto, "You know, you're going to get a hell lot of attention if you wear this stuff out in the public?"</p><p>"I know," said Naruto, a smirk forming on his face as he strapped on the new equipment. The half mask headband with the Konoha head band went on his face, it was exactly like the one the Nidaime used to wear, except that the headband was pitch black in color, with the Konoha symbol being in silver. A bit of chakra was channeled into the face and the headband stuck like second skin.</p><p>Next Naruto wore a couple of forearm protectors. They were made of three separate alloy plates that were linked together to form the armor (the ones Kakashi wore as a kid), and finally the thing that Naruto had to persuade the older man to forge, especially for him. Shin guards...but these weren't ordinary shin guards, they were made of the same metal used to make the daggers, which gave them the properties to channel elemental chakra. If all went according to plan, Naruto would have another technique to add to his repertoire. Both the armor sets were black in color.</p><p>"Oy Naruto, mind telling me how you're gonna pay for all this stuff? It costs twenty five thousand ryo! Fifteen for your shin guards, eight for the forearm protectors and two for the new headband, that reminds me…hand over your 'old' headband. Ninja's aren't allowed to carry two headbands of the same village."</p><p>"Don't worry old man, here," said Naruto as he gave Ichigo a wad of notes containing thirty thousand ryo. "Keep the five thousand, while I'm away I'll be sending orders for kunai and other stuff…that's payment in advance. As for how I got them…lets say it involved night and a knocked out sannin and lots of blood."</p><p>A smile formed on the older man's face, which soon erupted into full blown laughter, "Keep this up brat, and you'll be an assassin in no time. Now shooo…"</p><p>"Whatever old man…see you in four years," and with that Naruto walked out into the bright sunlight, a quick glance at his watch told him the time. At half past two, the blond sat down in a small booth at Ichiraku's and ordered a bowl of ramen. After ten bowls and a half full stomach the boy once again headed towards the Hokage tower to make his training trip official. Naruto stepped into the shadow of a tree…and vanished</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>"Yo old man!" exclaimed Naruto as he emerged from a shaded corner in the Hokage's office, startling the village most powerful man, causing him fall off his chair.</p><p>"Don't do…" the words died in Sarutobi's mouth as he looked over at Naruto, the dark outfit, armor and crimson eyes were frightening enough even to stop the Hokage in his speech.</p><p>"Do what…Hokage-<i>sama</i>" taunted Naruto, knowing full well what the Hokage was thinking.</p><p>"Nothing Naruto, are you leaving already?"</p><p>"Hai, hokage-sama."</p><p>"Very well then, before you go…there are a few things I want to give to you. Jiraiya instructed me to give them to you as he is on an information gathering mission. I believe they are techniques on how to use your summoning in different ways. Another thing I want to tell you is that most shinobi, when the become jounin have two elemental affinities. A person is usually born with one affinity and develops another by using jutsus of another element frequently, but you Naruto are an exception to this, because of your condition you cannot use regular ninjutsu properly. Even so…I want to tell you the process of developing another affinity. First of all, let's say that you want an affinity for earth, you will have to start of by using earth jutsus. After using about a hundred Doton jutsus, you will have to start on earth manipulation and master it. It is only then that you can add earth affinity to your chakra. Sometimes the combination of some elemental affinities allows you to make new jutsus of sub-elements. For example if you have an equal affinity for earth and water, you will be able to Mukoton jutsus, however after the Shodaime, no one had been able to duplicate this feat. The only person who can combine earth and water manipulation is Jiraiya, to form swamp jutsus. I'm telling you this because, you might one day, against all odds…gain another elemental affinity. Try to plan out from now on what element you want as your secondary affinity."</p><p>"Arigato…oji-san." Said Naruto while taking the scrolls and slipping them into his jounin vest.</p><p>"As for your training trip…I have already made it official. Starting from today you are free to enter and exit the territories of Konoha and her allies. However if you want access to jutsus of our allied villages, you'll have to seek their permission. You are to report to me every six months via a letter. If by the end of the four years you are not present in Konoha, you will be deamed an S-Class missing nin and be executed on sight. Alright?"</p><p>"Hai Hokage-sama," Naruto had already known that this would happen, he was high A-Class with the most powerful tailed demon sealed within him. No doubt Konoha would execute him if he went rouge.</p><p>With a two fingered salute, Naruto turned and merged with the shadows, only to emerge outside the gates of Konoha. He had already packed his things into scrolls last night so he could leave as soon as he could.</p><p>"I'll be back soon…and you will be proud of me…goodbye Konoha."</p><p>With that Naruto made his way into the jungle surrounding the village hidden in the leaves, his dark clothes blending perfectly with the surroundings. The rays of the sinking sun were blocked by the thick canopy, and a pair of glowing crimson eyes could be seen floating silently in the forest………The Legend of the Crimson Shadow were just beginning…</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p><b>A/N: SORRY!!!!!!!

</b></p><p align="center"><b>Chapter 9: S-Rank</b></p><p>Two years, three months and four days. It had been this long since Naruto had left Konoha to train himself.</p><p>Two months and twenty seven days since his first S-Rank mission, and Naruto could still hear the screams when he closed his eyes.</p><p align="center"><i><b>-Flashback-</b></i></p><p>Naruto was perfecting a new technique when he had received a letter via a hawk bearing the Konoha insignia</p><p><i>Naruto-san</i></p><p><i>Two members of the Konoha ANBU force have been taken hostage by a group of missing nins. Their base is located near the Konoha, Iwa border. The numbers of the enemy ninja are not determined. It is imperative that you rescue the ANBU members as they have valuable information and cannot be compromised. Once the ANBU members are rescued you are to then proceed to the control room of the base and plant explosives there to destroy the entire base. The explosives are sealed at the bottom of the scroll. Since the details of the number and the level of ninjas is not known, this mission is classified as S-Rank. Unfortunately the time limit for the completion of this mission is five days. After the designated time limit the two ANBU must be in Fire country, you however are free to remain at your current location. Failure will not be tolerated.</i></p><p><i>Remember this, </i><i><b>you must not</b></i><i> be seen you are to get in and get out without being seen. Anybody who sees you must be eliminated.</i></p><p><i>Sandaime Hokage</i></p><p>'Eliminated'…the words rang within Naruto's mind. He had completed four A-Rank and seven B-Rank missions for Konoha…but he had never killed a man. He would encounter enemy ninja, but would beat them up and leave them alive. <b>But</b>. Now, he had to kill if anyone saw him…he just wouldn't let anybody see him.</p><p>Naruto spent the rest of the day planning for his mission, and when night finally set in…he closed his eyes and stretched all his senses as far as he could. Like countless times before, Naruto fell one with the world around him. He could hear <i>everything </i>from the sound of his heartbeat to the insects chirping two miles away. As long as there was darkness, Naruto could sense anything. Finally, after two minutes of standing still and intense concentration, Naruto was finally able to get the location. The base was situated North-West from his current position.</p><p>Naruto once again opened his eyes, but instead of his normal red orbs, his eyes glowed an eerie crimson. Naruto took a step back into the shadows and disappeared.</p><p>And reappearing outside the base, it was nothing special. Just a cave.</p><p>"Oh well…here it goes,"</p><p>Naruto placed a hand on the cave wall and transported himself to the other side via shadows.</p><p>"Holy shit, was that a genjutsu! This place is freakin huge!"</p><p>Exclaimed Naruto as he gazed upon the large house, no…mansion. The place was two storied tall with moderate lighting, which could prove a problem for Naruto as this meant that he couldn't travel as easily as he had thought.</p><p>Figuring out the plan of action, the blond stuck to the shadows and crept up silently behind a couple of guards. As fast as lightening, Naruto struck and hit one of the guards on the neck with a swift chop, thus knocking him out. Before the other guard could turn around to take a look at his attacker, the chuunin found himself on the ground, bound and blinded by a cloth.</p><p>"Where's the power supply?" questioned Naruto, he deliberately applied chakra to his vocal chords to change his voice.</p><p>"W-who are you?" asked the frightened guard.</p><p>"Your executioner if you don't tell me what I want. Now. For the <i>last</i> time, where's the power supply?" Naruto applied a kunai to the ninja's throat to give more weight to his threat.</p><p>In hysterics the shaken chuunin quickly blubbered whatever came to his mind, "You won't get to it! Its guarded by three jounin south from here."</p><p>"Thanks for the info. If you manage to wake up, spread the word. Konoha is <i>not</i> to messed with." And with that, Naruto jabbed a couple of pressure points, rendering the nuke-nins arms useless and knocking him out.</p><p>'<i>The guard said that the place was guarded by jounin, meaning ninjas employed with a village. What the hell is going on?'</i></p><p>Without waiting another moment, Naruto hurried to south to where the power supply of the building was supposed to be located. Luckily, he didn't find any guards in his way. Upon reaching the power supply, Naruto found the nuke-nin's words from earlier to be true. The power supply was guarded by three jounins. Fortunately for him there was only one light bulb above the jounin, who were seated around a table playing some sort of a card game.</p><p>Upon clearer inspection of the headbands, crimson eyes narrowed in anger. It seemed that Iwa had gone against the peace treaty. Without a word or movement, Naruto split into four copies, three Kage bunshins and one original. Utilizing the shadows,the bunshins surrounded the unsuspecting jounins and performed the same genjutsu.</p><p>Before the jounin could even detect the slight chakra spike, the whisper of "<u>Genjutsu: Tree Bind Technique</u>" was heard before three lifeless bodies fell on the hard floor.</p><p>Naruto closed in eyes in silent prayer, this had been his first kill. Pushing the thoughts away he focused on the mission and dismissed the clones. After placing five explosive notes on the two large generators, Naruto shadow transported a good distance away before triggering the explosion. As expected, the entire base was blanketed under darkness.</p><p>Without wasting further time Naruto closed his eyes and stretched his senses to get the location of the two prisoners and number of ninjas in this building.</p><p>Fifty ninjas and two prisoners, another thing he overheard from a couple of shinobi was that there was apparently a power backup which would go bring partial power back within two minutes.</p><p>A pair of glowing crimson eyes opened in the darkness as the ten year old child emerged in the prison. After dispatching the two jounins guarding the prison, Naruto turned towards the prisoners. One was girl, around sixteen years of age an extremely pretty. Her clothes were torn in a few places and blood covered her hands. The other man was <i>much </i>worse off. A long gash ran across his face, burns and screw holes covered much of his skull. Another man would have presumed him to be dead, but Naruto heard the brief beating of the man's heart.</p><p>"Don't worry, I'm from Konoha. Sandaime sent me to rescue you." Said Naruto to the girl.</p><p>"Oh yeah, which division are you from?" asked the girl. Her voice betraying her hard face.</p><p>"I'm not ANBU. Uzumaki Naruto, jounin. Now come with me if you want to live. We don't have much time."</p><p>Reluctantly she grabbed Naruto's hand. "'m Anko, Viper of the assassination squad. Me and my comrade were captured while coming back from a mission…"</p><p>She was however cut off by Naruto, "We don't have much time. Grab your comrade, we're out of here."</p><p>"And how do you plan to get out of…" Anko was unable to complete her sentence as she and her unconscious partner were grabbed and whisked away. A second later Mitarashi Anko found herself in a completely unfamiliar surrounding with only the moonlight illuminating her surroundings. To her complete shock, she found a young sweating boy with a jounin jacket, laying Ibiki down on a mattress.</p><p>Quickly grabbing a nearby kunai Anko dashed towards the boy, "Allright, who are you and who and whom do you work for?"</p><p>Further to her surprise, the boy she was holding burst into dark wisps before she found a kunai on her throat. "Like I said, Uzumaki Naruto, jounin of Konoha. If you want proof check my bag over there for the official letter from Sandaime," said Naruto as he pointed over to where a blue travel bag was placed, "Now I'm going to complete the second half of my mission.</p><p>Naruto then formed the standard release seal and said, "Kai". Blue tattoos emerged on Naruto's body before fading away back into his skin. "There, much better. I'm leaving my med kit here Anko-san. Take care of your Nakama. I'll be back shortly."</p><p>With those last words, Naruto shrunk back into the shadows, leaving a thoroughly confused and pissed of Anko, her attention however, was diverted to one Morino Ibiki and she quickly got to work with whatever little medical knowledge she had.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Meanwhile, Naruto emerged back outside the mansion. Now that he knew that it was hidden behind a genjutsu, he didn't waste time on it. By the looks of it, the entire mansion was crawling with shinobi.</p><p>'<i>They must have found the guards and the missing jounin. I can't get rid of the secondary power supply. There's no doubt that they'd have doubled the guard on it. At least there's only partial power backup. Even so, I won't be able to use the shadows to get in and out quickly. Seems I'll have to do it the hard way'</i></p><p>Using what little cover he had, Naruto made his way to the back of the building and used chakra to stick to its surface and climbed up. Upon locating a room with its light off, Naruto teleported into there and from there onwards made his way towards the control room. It was fortunate that Naruto had been able to get a fix on the control room's location earlier or else he would have had to use trial and error to get to the chamber.</p><p>Naruto would use shuriken to burst the lights and then kill or disable anyone who stood in his way. The screams, they were the most horrifying part of this routine. Often the ten year old child would have to stop and clear his head of the screams that resonated within his mind. Three years ago he had dreamed to become a ninja and rescue beautiful princesses, not killing shinobi without mercy or remorse, his only consolation was that he had made it painless and fast.</p><p>Fifteen minutes later, Naruto had finally reached the control room. As opposed to the rest of the base, this room was brightly lit and was occupied by ten jounins and five nuke-nins and a crap load of machinery, ranged from tracking and monitoring devices to intelligence.</p><p>"Hmm….we've been waiting for you little shadow. I've seen how moved, out of the shadows, killing shinobi left and right. Yet I see, you are a child." He drew a deep breath and continued "it matters not. You will die tonight." Said a nuke-nin with a piece of cloth wrapped around his eyes and graying hair. He signaled the other fourteen ninjas to attack the blonde.</p><p>Within seconds, seven had fallen unconscious with their arms and legs broken. The other seven, looked at Naruto in shock. Silence, the room was filled with it as eight fully grown shinobi stood on one side and a single ten year old on the other.</p><p>As one, the remaining seven jounin launched jutsus.</p><p>"<u>Doton: Doryuu Dango</u>"</p><p>"<u>Katon: Karyuu Endan</u>"</p><p>"<u>Suiton: Suryuudan</u>"</p><p>Jutsus from three elements rushed towards Naruto, the boy however simply smiled and waited. When the techniques had come close to him he disappeared and reappeared near one of the jounin.</p><p>"You know, your going to have a hard time catching me with jutsu if I'm faster than them."</p><p>With that, Naruto punched the man near the heart with all his strength, the years of training at high gravity had enhanced Naruto's strength to supernormal levels. The simple punch crushed the man's ribs and put so much pressure o the heart, that the organ stopped beating.</p><p>Ten seconds and six punches later, all ninja's except for the blind huke-nin were taken care off.</p><p>"Only you're left right now oji-san. I have my orders to kill anyone who sees me. Surrender now and I'll make your death painless and fast."</p><p>"It is sad to see a young child like you talk about killing so carelessly. What has Konoha come to? Does your soul not hurt at killing fellow humans?! Does it not scream out when you crush the life out of someone? Someone who has a family, probably children as old as you?!"</p><p>Unbidden and unwanted, images of the ninjas he had killed within the last hour flashed through his eyes. However for some reason the last image was of the Konoha ANBU lying on the floor, his skull covered with burns and face riddles with gashes.</p><p>"SHUT UP!! You talk about me killing, what about your subordinates. They tortured and disfigured a shinobi. At least I kill when I have to and I make it painless!! But you're much worse, you torture! ASSHOLE! I'll kill you!</p><p>Blinded by rage Naruto rushed forward at full speed aiming to kill the man with one good hit…only to find his left arm fall to his side limp. In his anger, Naruto had lowered his guard and had been ambushed by a shadow clone.</p><p>"Good, a shinobi must be mentally strong. It's good to see that you didn't break from my…torture" The normally apathetic face of the man turned vicious as he snarled. Now, let's see how the prodigy of the Gama Sannin faces against the most powerful clan in the entire shinobi world. With that proclamation, the man ripped of the cloth covering his eyes.</p><p>Veins bulged as Naruto muttered one word,</p><p>"Hyuuga."</p><p>"Yes little boy…Hyuuga. The greatest bloodline to ever exist. Our eyes not only lets us see all around, but they also lets me see the tenketsu or chakra points and all your vital organs easily. You are powerful, yes. But against the might of the Hyuuga. You. Will. Fall."</p><p>"hehe…you talk about the might of the Hyuuga. But you left the village…in fact you ran with your tail between your legs. I recognize you now. The only Konoha shinobi to be a part of two ANBU divisions at the same time. You were a part of the interrogation and torture squad <i>and</i> the infiltration and assassination squad. Had to flee the village when you were caught helping the snake sannin Orochimaru…Hyuuga Shinji."</p><p>"you've done your homework brat…but come…let's see you fight with just one arm."</p><p>A ghost of a smirk crept up Naruto's face as he started forming a strategy to defeat the ex-ANBU in front of him. Unlike Jiraiya, who had gone easy on him when they had fought for his jounin rank. The shinobi in front of him wouldn't hesitate to use anything to kill him….</p><p>'<i>Perfect…'</i></p><p>Naruto looked at the old man in front of him and said one thing.</p><p>"Let's dance."</p><p>Shinji burst forward at amazing speeds but still wasn't a match for the little kid who kept on dodging each and every one of the Shinji's Jyuuken strikes.</p><p>"You're fast brat…but you lack experience." Said the slightly sweating ninja before commanding one of his kage bunshin finish the blonde from behind. Just as the clone's finger's were about to deliver the lethal touch to Naruto's heart, the Naruto being targeted burst into dark wisps causing the clones attack to pass straight through. Before Shinji could get over his shock, he heard a cry from the other side of the room.</p><p>"<u>Wind Scythe</u>!"</p><p>The Hyuuga turned only to see a huge arc of extremely finely molded wind element chakra heading straight towards his head, but before he could duck to avoid the chakra blast his eyes caught the same technique heading towards him, launched by the shadow clone that had somehow regained form and bound his own clone. Having no choice left. He unleashed his ultimate shield.</p><p>"<u>Kaiten.</u>"</p><p>The chakra shield battled with the two scythe blasts for a while before finally winning and deflecting the two blasts into the nearby wall, almost slicing them in half.</p><p>A panting Shinji stopped spinning, and fell down on one knee.</p><p>'<i>Damit! Beaten by a ten year old. H-how did he do that bunshin without hanseals?!'</i></p><p>Shinji looked up to see Naruto walking calmly towards him. The only thing unusual was that his shin guards were glowing light blue.</p><p>At Shinji's confused look, Naruto explained, "You don't necessarily need handseals to do jutsu. I've mastered the Kage Bunshin to such an extent that I don't need the seals for it. Thus making your initial advantage worthless. As for the technique, it was something I just invented for myself Hyuuga-san. I form wind chakra around my shin guards and then launch it towards the enemy. Normally it would cause chakra depletion very quickly, but due to my larger than normal reserves. I can fire ten of these babies before feeling a strain."</p><p>Soft chuckle escaped the defeated Hyuuga's lips before quickly turning into full blown laughter. "You think you've defeated me Naruto-kun. Hehehe…you're still wet behind the ears, yet you killed all those people, without remorse or regret. Ending lives at the snap of your wrist…what kind of monster are you? Those glowing eyes, they belong to the Kyuubi don't they? Yes…I can make out from your expression. Striking a deal with the very demon that killed so many ninja's of the very village you've sworn to protect. I won't be surprised if you kill the very man who trained you one day…<i>monster</i>."</p><p>The last words were spoken with such contempt and venom that Naruto snapped. His mind stopped working and his body stood rigid. He never the noticed the smirk across Shinji's face as he pushed the last remaining chakra into his legs before delivering 129 blows to his body. 128 designed to put a man out of commission and the last blow straight to the heart. He never noticed his clone switching with himself right before the last blow to the heart was dealt. He never noticed the defeat and the rage on Shinji's face when he realized that a shadow clone had taken his blow to the heart. Naruto didn't even notice his opponent fall down on the ground due to chakra exhaustion, unable to move.</p><p>Naruto didn't notice anything except, watching the dying moments of all those ninja's that had fallen by his hands. He did however notice the blackness that was engulfing his vision.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"</b></p><p>"<b>So you're back again flesh bag?"</b> said the outline of a male from behind the bars.</p><p>"Am I dead."</p><p>"<b>No, unfortunate though it is…if you die then so do I. My chakra is currently opening your tenketsu again. You were lucky that your clone replaced you with a Kawarimi or you would have been a dead monkey."</b></p><p>"<b>I have a deal for you?"</b></p><p>"What the hell do you mean fur ball."</p><p>Three huge claws shot out from behind the bars and impaled Naruto straight through the stomach. Kyuubi's killing intent flared and finally something clicked in Naruto's mind.</p><p>Through the pain, Naruto thought two words, <i>'That's why…'</i></p><p>"<b>Shut your mouth brat. In here I can kill you a thousand times over!"</b></p><p>The haziness clouding his mind from the parting words of Hyuuga Shinji cleared and after what seemed like a lifetime, he could think, and upon being blinded from pain because of three claws, Naruto's eyes narrowed.</p><p>Unknown to him his own crimson orbs started glowing and Kyuubi's own killing intent lessened considerably.</p><p>"Listen now fox. You are trapped within <b>my</b> mind. You <b>will</b> follow my rules…"</p><p>In an instant Naruto melded into the shadows and emerged out from where the claws had impaled him. With a wave of his hand his wounds healed, '<i>As I thought. My mind, my world, my rules.</i>'</p><p>"I will not have any deals with you. I have never asked for your chakra and I forbid you to lend me any of your power anymore."</p><p>With a war cry, Kyuubi transformed into his fox form lunged at the bars, but with a command from Naruto, it seemed that the bars only got thicker and size of the colossal cage shrunk a bit. Giving the huge demon no amount of space to move.</p><p>"Stay boy…good…now sit."</p><p>Unable to stop him, Kyuubi's killing intent rose to an all new level, for a second paralyzing even Naruto, as he obediently sat down on his haunches like a common mongrel</p><p>With that Naruto once again merged into the shadows.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Naruto opened his eyes to find himself surrounded by fifteen bodies. Even though he now knew how and why Shinji had tortured him mentally, he had been right about one thing. Naruto had either killed or permanently disabled all ninjas in this compound.</p><p>With his mind made up he exited the room and disappeared into the shadows, only to reenter half an hour later after having knocking out and relocating nearly thirty still alive ninjas to a place outside the blast perimeter.</p><p>Once getting that chore out of his way, Naruto kneeled in the control room itself and prayed for safe passage for all those souls who had died by his hand. After that, the blonde quickly planted the bomb near a large computer console and set the timer for five minutes.</p><p>Once this was done, Naruto teleported to the medic room where dissected bodies of various shinobi from different villagers were lying on a table and planted two more explosive devices there. For the third time Naruto teleported to the weapons room and planted another bomb near a stash of explosive notes.</p><p>Once his mission was done, Naruto teleported back to the clearing in which he had left Anko and her comrade.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>"How are you Anko-san?" said Naruto as he emerged from the shadows behind the woman.</p><p>Within seconds he had a kunai and ten katanas at his throat. Naruto had not bothered to check the clearing before he entered and as a result found himself being the target of an entire ANBU squad.</p><p>"I apologize Uzumaki-san, you gave us quiet the scare." Said an ANBU with gravity defying silver hair, "I assume your mission was a success then?"</p><p>The dog masked ANBU's question was answered by the sound of distant explosions and smoke rising into the air.</p><p>"Excellent. The Hokage sends his congratulations on your first successful S-Rank mission. Your mission pay will be added to your existing bank account."</p><p>"Give him my thanks ANBU-san, also kindly inform him that the A-Rank missing nin Hyuuga Shinji is now dead."</p><p>Naruto's words were punctuated with silence. The silver haired ANBU spoke up again, "Indeed Naruto-san, then the bounty on his head will also be added to you account. But I take your leave now, we are here to escort Anko-san and Ibiki-san back to Konoha."</p><p>"All right then," Naruto turned to Anko, "Be safe."</p><p>For a moment Anko's face turned furious at the thought of a ten year old boy telling her to be safe. <i>'She was fifteen for crying out loud!' </i>But as soon as anger had consumed her, it left, instead filling her with the warmth of knowing that someone cared.</p><p>"Hai." She replied before turning and heading out with the other ANBU.</p><p>Shaking his head Naruto sat down on a log and started mending his wounds. It seemed that by forbidding the Kyuubi from giving him any chakra, he had unknowingly cut of his incredible healing. Sighing, Naruto allowed the Kyuubi to heal him.</p><p>Within seconds the wounds were taken care of, Naruto took out his flute and began playing a tune of his own. For some reason, the wind picked up just then, gently carrying his music to the group of shinobi who had just left his camp.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Anko had been traveling at a moderate pace that was set for her and for Kakashi who was carrying Ibiki on his back, the man's head had been covered with a headband-turned bandana, when the wind carried a tune to her ears.</p><p>The music made her heart flutter and her soul reach out. A ghost of a smile could be seen on her face as she thought…. '<i>So it was you…Naruto</i>'</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX(2 days later at the Iwa Border)XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>A chuunin guard who had gone to take a piss and strayed from his normal patrol route found a large group of Iwa and nuke-nins lying in a pile. After most of them had regained consciousness, they had all told the same story. The base was destroyed by a <i>single </i>Konoha shinobi who apparently moved through the shadows and defeated any who stood in his path…it was a shivering chuunin who told the Tsuchikage of the message that 'Crimson Shadow' had left, "Don't mess with Konoha."</p><p>That was what the survivors of the 'Blue Star' operation called that man, 'Crimson Shadow'. Nothing was known about the man except that he moved extremely fast, had glowing red eyes and hailed from Konoha. An S-Class ninja in the bingo book of Iwa. Commanders would instruct their subordinates to flee if they ever see any person having glowing red eyes.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p align="center"><i><b>-Flashback End-</b></i></p><p>Naruto gazed at the stars one last time, before going to sleep. A dreamless sleep that had long been due. Tomorrow he would head towards the village hidden in the mist.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX </b></p><p>It had taken Naruto a week's worth of travel to reach Mizu no Kuni or Water country. It was during this time that Naruto finally made peace with himself. He had decided, he would kill only when necessary, and then provide the dead ninja with the proper respect and a funeral. This was his promise to himself. Another thing that Naruto realized about his fighting style was that he would often compromise speed for strength, Naruto could either hit hard, or he could hit fast, and against a strong opponent, this could prove to be fatal. He would need to change this.</p><p>Once again paying attention to his surrounding, the ten year old took a look around, only to find a thick fog covered the surrounding area, making it difficult for him to see even a meter in front of him. Even Naruto's eyes couldn't see past the chakra enhanced mist. Before he could get a fix on the village's exact location, before he could even move a foot forward, for the second time in the same week Naruto was surrounded by blades.</p><p>When the mist cleared, Naruto saw four men and two kunoichi all with some sort of swords pointed at his vital points.</p><p>"Who are you child and what do you want here?" said an old man with his katana pointed at Naruto's neck. The said shinobi, was around the Sandaime's age but was bald, had a long beard and a rather large cross shaped scar on his head.</p><p>"I've come here looking for the famous sword smith Kentaro, I mean you no harm." Naruto held up his arms indicating that he came in peace.</p><p>A few of the swordsmen chuckled, but the yet unnamed man spoke again, "These are the remnants of the seven swordsmen of the mist. As for me, I am Kentaro. What do you want from me?"</p><p>Naruto had known previously that the Mizukage had wanted the remnants of the seven swordsmen dead, but he hadn't known that they would be on the run with the most famous smith in the shinobi word. The man who had personally forged each and every sword that the seven swordsmen carried and had allegiance to no village. The man who had also forged two other swords, the Raijen and Kusnagi.</p><p>"I humbly ask you to make a sword for me." Said Naruto with a hint of pleading in his voice.</p><p>"Leave him," said the old man and immediately six swords were sheathed, "and why would I do that? Even though you are a jounin, you still are a small child. You'll never be able to handle a sword."</p><p>Naruto's eyes narrowed as he barely managed to contain his anger, "I have been searching for you for the past two years and you're just blowing me off!"</p><p>"Get lost kid, I have enough problems of my own. I don't wanna get involved again, now leave." Kentaro said in a bored manner, then he turned his back towards Naruto and walked away.</p><p>As soon as the old man had finished uttering the last word, Naruto was grabbed by five pair of hands, and in flash two of the five pairs were down.</p><p>Upon hearing the commotion, Kentaro turned his head and was shocked to see two swordsmen down. Granted that the two were the weakest, but eliminating two A-Class ninja in a second was not a feat and ordinary shinobi could do.</p><p>Before the remaining three former Kiri nin could regroup and charge, they were stopped by the sudden reappearance of Kentaro. "You're different kid, I'll give you that. Let's make a deal, you fight me and if you manage to impress me then I'll make a sword for you. But if you lose, you'll have to quit as a Konoha nin and join us. Agreed?"</p><p>The small group was plunged into silence as they all waited for Naruto to answer, "Agreed."</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX </b></p><p><b>A/N: I just couldn't stop writing this chapter. I had originally planned till Naruto gets his 'sword' but this chapter was getting so long that it was becoming a chore.</b> <b>Anyway I give you all chapter 9.

</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 10</h3><hr><br><p align="center"><b>Chapter 10: Twin Blades of Destruction</b></p><p>"…Agreed."</p><p>As soon as the words left Naruto's mouth, the remaining swordsmen gathered their comrades and crept back into the mist with smirks on their faces. The mist itself seemed to get thicker and surround the two combatants.</p><p>The sound of a sword being pulled out of its sheath followed soon after as Kentaro slowly took out a katana. The basic structure was of any other Japanese sword. But that was where the similarities ended. The blade was dark blue, almost violet in colour and the surface seemed to shimmer, like that of water. The guard was circular in nature like that of any katana, but the on the end of the hilt, a small sapphire stone was embedded. The sword itself was four feet in length.</p><p>The two opponents stared into each others eyes for the longest time, trying to find any sign of weakness in the other's style. A flash of irritation passed through both their eyes upon realizing that there was none. With an unspoken signal, the two clashed.</p><p>The ground split from underneath them at the force of the collision, forcing the two to leap back. Being younger, Naruto was the first to recover and renew his attack. Punches upon punches were thrown at Kentaro, forcing the man to put all his concentration towards dodging the fast appendages. After twenty seconds of continuous dodging, Kentaro finally got enough room to bring his sword into the foray, with barely a twist of his wrist, three thin lines appeared on Naruto's flak jacket, which was the only thing which stopped the sword slashes from cutting skin.</p><p>With a mighty leap, Naruto put some distance between them.</p><p>'<i>That was fast! I barely saw him move his wrist. Who knows what would have happened if he had used his entire arm for the slashes!'</i></p><p>Naruto barely had another moment to spare before Kentaro thrust his sword into the air, increasing its length to almost ten times its length. Before he had the time to mount a proper defense the sword had pierced through his stomach. Crimson blood gushed out of Naruto's mouth before he collapsed.</p><p>"Never think that you out of reach of a master swordsman child. Perhaps you'll remember that…"</p><p>Kentaro was cut off by a kunai on his throat, "And you'd do well to not underestimate me Kentaro-san."</p><p>The 'Naruto' he had been fighting dissolved into dark wisps.</p><p>"Good strategy, you couldn't have been using kage bunshin from the start because there's no place to hide the bunshin. So, that means you created a shadow clone without seals without announcing its name, and immediately had him replace you with a seal-less Kawarimi, I'm impressed. But where did you hide in all of this?"</p><p>"Shadows Kentaro-san…"</p><p>"Clever…I've heard rumors of you, the Iwa shinobi call you the Crimson Shadow, the man who single handedly wiped out an entire base filled to the brim with ninjas in one night. Perhaps you're worthy of a sword after all…"</p><p>Before the two could continue, Naruto felt a sword protruding out from his back, but strangely he felt no pain, or the loss of blood. In his confusion he barely noticed the sword leave his body, along with its owner.</p><p>"It seams you are confused Naruto-san, then let me clear your mind…the name of my sword is…Illusion." Said Kentaro with a wave of his sword.. "I never thought that I'd have to use its abilities, but you've proved to be an interesting opponent."</p><p>His sword seamed to ripple slightly, but before Naruto could show his surprise, Kantaro burst forward at a speed unimaginable, his old speed paled in comparison to this. But that was not what drew Naruto's undivided towards the man. Five Kentaros were running towards Naruto, almost as if they were Kage bunshins</p><p>Readying himself Naruto braced himself for the inevitable attack. Lashing out, he kicked the first Kentaro that came within his range. Only to find that his foot passed straight through. Before he could recover from his shock, two deep gashes appeared on his forearms.</p><p>Grimacing as the cuts started to heal; Naruto said "Those aren't normal bunshins are they?"</p><p>"So you noticed…you impress me yet again Naruto-san." That is a special bunshin which can be produced only through this sword. A normal bunshin in all aspects except that it has a shadow and produces sound when it runs."</p><p>"Genius…then I have no choice, be proud Kentaro-san, for you'll be the first person to feel the fury of shadow fist."</p><p>As soon as Naruto finished his words, a bunshin materialized through a plume of smoke. "Come…"</p><p>Both the Naruto's extended their hands, taunting the elder man to take the bait. He didn't need to however, because Kentaro once again began running towards him. As soon as he took a step forward, the air besides him rippled and four more Kentaros appeared behind him. Thus began the true battle.</p><p>Naruto soon figured out that it was next to impossible to determine who the real swordsman was as the illusions completely surrounded him and were flawless. As a result of this he used the strategy of switching with his clone right when he was about to be hit with a sword. The clone would burst into shadows and reform again once the weapon had been removed, giving Naruto a lock on the real Kentaro.</p><p>The battle lasted for an hour before Kentaro called a stop. Both parties were panting and had their share of bruises. The older swordsman was sporting bruised ribs and a black eye whereas Naruto's clothes were ripped in various places from the slashes he had received. His injuries however, had been healed by the fox demon.</p><p>"You did well Crimson Shadow," panted Kentaro, "had we continued, I would have been forced to use my jutsus."</p><p>"Hehe…that wouldn't have been a problem old man…I hadn't even released my gravity seals yet!"</p><p>For the first time in his life Kentaro was stumped, he had drawn a match with a kid who hadn't even been fighting at full power. True even he himself hadn't use his arsenal of genjutsus, ninjutsus and kinjutsus but still…had that boy released his weights, he might have just lost.</p><p>"You impressed me…that's for sure. Meet me here in two weeks for your swords."</p><p>With those parting words, Kentaro disappeared into the mist, followed by the five dark human like shapes…the remnants of the once great organization of Kiri, legends in the shinobi world, reduced to nothing more than vagabonds and refugees.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX </b>(2 weeks later)<b> XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Two weeks had passed since Naruto had been promised a sword by the greatest sword maker who had ever lived, and it had been seven hours since Naruto had been sitting on a hard rock waiting for the said sword maker.</p><p>Finally through the mist Naruto saw the figures of three men walking towards him, in the center was Kentaro with a bundle on his back with two swordsmen wearing shinobi armor and cloaks by his either side. Upon reaching where he sat, Kentaro gave a goofy smile, which almost made Naruto lose his composure and hit that old man…hard.</p><p>"Here are your swords…as I promised. Before I give them to you, I must tell you how I made them, each sword I have ever forged was made after I had fought its soon to be wielder, the Nidaime was highly unpredictable in battle and had a lot of talent for water jutsus, thus I forged for him the Raijen, a sword capable of channeling lightening, thus giving his jutsus an extra kick. Orochimaru was like a snake, dexterous and slippery…I gave him the kusanagi, a sword as tricky as its master and capable of producing a potent poison on its own. The same is for every member of the Seven Swordsman. The swords I have made for you, will suit you perfectly. You are stealthy and silent, yet when forced, you are more devastating than any force of nature. You prefer to avoid killing, but when you have no choice, you choose the method which involves little pain. However if someone was to threaten your precious people, you would obliterate him in the most painful way possible. This is why I present you with these blades."</p><p>Kentaro unstrapped the bundle from his back and placed it on the ground in front of Naruto. He lifted the cloth, showing Naruto the first glimpse of his new twin swords. A single look was enough to make the jounin gasp in surprise. The hilt was a bit curved and had a customized black grip made especially for Naruto's hands. The cross guard was triangular in nature, while the blade itself was double edged and extremely sharp. The same was true for its twin.</p><p>Once Naruto had taken a good look at the blades, Kentaro spoke up again, "The hilt is slightly curved so that you can perform slashes faster. The tip of the blade is pointed and sharp so the sword can stab as well. The blade itself is only slightly broader than a regular katana; it's just the right size for you to perform fast dexterous moves without it being a hindrance."</p><p>Naruto had just opened his mouth to comment on the blade before Kentaro cut him off, "That's not all, like all my creations, these swords will never dull and will never ever get notched. Now as you already know, each and every sword that I have forged has a special property. Now, pick up your swords and strike at any tree that catches your fancy,"</p><p>Doing as instructed, Naruto picked up a sword, taking pleasure in the way the hilt seemed to meld with his hand. Choosing the thickest tree he could find, Naruto struck the trunk with a powerful stroke and to his surprise, the blade had sliced through half the trunk before coming to a stop.</p><p>"Now, channel some of your chakra into it." Ordered Kentaro</p><p>Doing as he was told, Naruto pushed a sliver of his chakra into the hilt, only for a small explosion to rock the tree, blasting the trunk of the tree apart. Dumbstruck, Naruto turned towards Kentaro for an explanation</p><p>"There is a small chakra sensitive crystal embedded in the hilt of both your blades, it converts chakra into explosive chakra, forcing the new potent chakra out through the blade. Now imagine, the same thing, except for a human as a target."</p><p>Words escaped Naruto as he looked at the beautiful blade in his hand and on the ground. He had expected an ordinary blade from the sword smith, never in his wildest dreams had he imagined that he would forge something so magnificent. Humbled, Naruto kneeled on the ground and muttered, "Arigato Gozaimasu Kentaro-san."</p><p>"There's no need for that child. I sensed your potential the moment I locked fists with you. A wise man once said that two experienced fighters can read each other's minds when their fists meet. Now as per our agreement, I'll teach you about kenjutsu until I feel that you're worthy to wield your swords in battle."</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p><b>A/N: Once again I'm sorry for the late update but my parents suddenly decided to go to a hill-station without any prior planning.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 11</h3><hr><br><p align="center"><b>Chapter 10: Partners</b></p><p><b>Disclaimer: I do not own Naruto. It belongs to Kishimoto Masashi.</b></p><p>Blades clanged as two fighters danced around the training area, lightening fast slashes were made and dodged. Sweat flowed in streams as Naruto and Kentaro were having their last spar.</p><p>Ten months had passed since Naruto had begun his short tutelage under the sword master, and many times he had found himself tired, dirty and on the ground wondering just how an eighty year old man could kick a jounin's ass in a matter of minutes. The old man was a harder task master than even Jiraiya. During his stay, Naruto was forbidden to release his gravity seals and forced to wear weights on his arms and legs. Currently he had eighty pounds on his legs and sixty on his arms.</p><p>Kentaro had refused to teach Naruto a specific style; instead he had been advised by the old man to make his own kenjutsu style. Instead, Naruto was forced to train from dawn till dusk with only three breaks in between. Throughout his entire regime, he would perform diagonal slashes for an hour, then alternating with stabs for an hour and so on. The effects however were clearly evident as Naruto could now match the much older man. However with a lack of a proper style, Naruto was still at a disadvantage.</p><p>The battle remained at a stalemate till Kentaro touched his blade with a finger, causing his blade to start shimmering. Naruto in turn dropped his weights and reversed the grip on the sword in his left hand.</p><p>"Time to get serious Kentaro-sensei?"</p><p>Naruto's question was answered by a smirking Kentaro who burst forward with five illusions trailing behind him. Now that Naruto had fought the trickster, he knew that the Kentaro in the front wasn't real. The real Kentaro could anyone from the five. But before Kentaro could even reach his young student, Naruto found himself trapped in a fiery world. He found himself being lowered into a river of magma flowing beneath him. Recognizing this to be a genjutsu, Naruto tried to dispel it, only to find that he could move his body. Closing his eyes Naruto tried to stop his chakra flow. After what seemed like hours, he managed to dispel the jutsu. Naruto looked around to find his short term sensei; the entire clearing was devoid of activity.</p><p>Without any indication two hands shot up from the ground and tried to grab a hold of Naruto's legs. It was only out of reflex that Naruto managed to jump and back flip out of the way. Acrobatics was another thing Kentaro had forced Naruto to master. He still remembered how Kentaro had made him stand on a rope suspended twenty feet above the ground to build up his balance.</p><p>Before Kentaro could emerge from the ground Naruto did a few handseals and slammed his hands on the ground while shouting, "<u>Earth Element: Swamp of the Underworld</u>". Almost immediately the entire area near Kentaro turned into quicksand, sucking in the old swordsman. But that wasn't the only thing that the quicksand did, it also leached the chakra from the person trapped within.</p><p>Understanding that his chakra was being drained, Kentaro dissolved into mud and reappeared outside the quicksand, but not before loosing a fourth of his chakra. Now visibly panting, the man looked at his younger student before charging forward. The two fighters and four illusions resumed their dance as five figures watched from a distance. Naruto was using all of his speed and dexterity to avoid Kentaro's blows while Kentaro was using his experience and strength to block Naruto's strikes.</p><p>Naruto's twin swords flashed as he used the one in his right hand to block his sensei's swings and slashed at the man with the blade in his left hand. The two appeared to be at a stalemate, but any practiced shinobi could tell that the older man was tiring out, and as expected, a tired Kentaro was pushed towards a tree. With a twitch of Naruto's finger, a small spike shot out from the tree's shadow and impaled Kentaro just above his knee.</p><p>Before Kentaro could triumph over the pain that racked his body, he found a sword at his jugular.</p><p>"You lose sensei." Naruto said with a smirk on his face, his crimson eyes shining in the light of the early sun.</p><p>"This makes it four wins out of ten Naruto-san. You're improving, I must say, winning two consecutive matches against me is quiet a feat. There is nothing more I can teach you." Kentaro said.</p><p>Taking a hand offered by Naruto, Kentaro got to his feet and used what medical jutsu he knew to care of his stab wound. As both student and teacher watched, the wound closed under the green light. Wincing slightly Kentaro lifted his leg, before turning to Naruto, "It was a pleasure coaching you Naruto-san. It is very rare that I am able to teach someone so dedicated. Before you leave I want you to have this," Kentaro handed Naruto a scroll, "This scroll contains the location of a sword of legend. I had once tried to claim it, but unfortunately I lost to the beast that guards this treasure. Only three others know of this blade, two of which are powerful enough to claim it. Therefore you must hurry and not waste time…Now go."</p><p>"Hai sensei." Said Naruto, "Thank you for teaching me and making me worthy to wield these blades, I will cherish your teachings and make a style of legend by the time we meet again. Believe it!" he shouted.</p><p>"Hmmm…we'll see about that brat. Now get going if you want that sword."</p><p>With a nod, Naruto re-strapped the weights on his legs and arms and then walked over to where his blades were. With a flick of his wrist, the two blades vanished in a puff of smoke. With a one handed seal Naruto released his gravity seals and promptly vanished.</p><p>Kicking up a dust trail as ran off.</p><p>"The kid's learned sealing huh? I wonder where he got the time from."</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Naruto reappeared two kilometers north from the camp. He bent down slowly panting as he looked at the dust trail he left behind.</p><p>'<i>Maybe it wasn't a good idea to show off. Ah well, nothing can be done about it now.'</i></p><p>After regaining his breath Naruto sat down on a patch of grass and opened the scroll given to him.</p><p><i>Naruto,</i></p><p><i>For many years hundreds of swordsmen have searched for the legendary blade, no one knows its name, but what we do know is that a man wielding this blade can match the biju in direct combat. Anyone who went in search of this blade never returned. The only exception to this was me and my grandfather and Orochimaru. Since I was never able to obtain the blade I gave its location to two people I felt worthy. They were Kisame of the hidden mist and Orochimaru of the hidden Leaf. Now, I give you the coordinates. I feel that you'll be the one to claim the blade, in all my years of life (I've had a long one) I've never seen a shinobi with so much potential such as you.</i></p><p><i>Before you go off in search of it, I want to warn you of a beast that guards this blade. It is a demon of that I am sure, for I have never seen a creature like it. It has the body of a lion but has wings like that of a bat protruding from its back. It is a vicious fighter and has some degree of control over the elements. Do </i><i><b>not</b></i><i> take him lightly.</i></p><p><i>I urge you Naruto, to go as fast as you can. Both Kisame and Orochimaru are not who they used to be and will use any means to attain the blade. You must get it before they do!</i></p><p><i>The blade is located in the ruins of a tower near the border of Sand and Stone country. Be safe.</i></p><p><i>Your proud sensei, </i></p><p><i>Kentaro</i></p><p>A small smile formed on Naruto's face as he finished reading the letter, Kentaro never expressed such emotions in front of him. He would only call Naruto, child or Naruto-san or rarely brat. It really made Naruto warm inside to know that his sensei was proud of him.</p><p>A look of determination set into Naruto's face as burnt the scroll with a bit of Fire manipulation and set off towards his destination.</p><p>A half an hour's journey later Naruto reached the docks. The scent of the open sea permeating his nose. For some reason the sea had always calmed him. As Naruto walked down the docks he noticed the odd assortment of people that called the sea their home. Dozens of fisherman were preparing to head out for their daily hunt, while small time businessmen prepared for customers whom they would ferry across the water to Fire Country.</p><p>Naruto made his way to such a man. He was a short fellow with spiky gray hair and dark sunglasses, wearing a tuxedo.</p><p>"Welcome young shinobi! I see you're in need of a ferry. Maybe I can help? Gatou Shipping Company is the finest of them all. I'll have a deluxe room ready for you. Only seven thousand ryo." Without waiting for a response the short man turned around and started swaggering towards his ship.</p><p>"Wait…" said Naruto, causing Gatou to stop and turn around, "I don't want your deluxe room. I'll give you a thousand ryo for it. It's the standard fair. Take it or leave it."</p><p>For a second a look of malice flashed behind Gatou's eyes before it disappeared and he said in a fake sweet voice instantly putting Naruto's senses into alert. "Of course sir, follow me."</p><p>Nervously Naruto fingered his kunai holster and slipped a kunai into the bandages in his right arm. Gatou showed him to the deck before he himself went below the deck to attend to some work. Not even five minutes had passed since the ship had left the docks before Gatou came up with twenty thugs behind him.</p><p>"Alright brat! You could have paid me the money and traveled to your home safely, but you had to be a wise guy didn't you? Now hand over everything you have." Said Gatou.</p><p>"Hai hai, don't get your panties in a twist Gatou-chan" Slowly Naruto raised his hands above his head, concentrating on molding his chakra through his chakra coils and projecting it behind Gatou's men.</p><p>With almost inaudible poofs pf smoke, five Kage Bunshins appeared behind the thugs and disabled them by hitting the back of their necks. Before the remaining fifteen could react Naruto threw the kunai hidden in his bandages at Gatou's knee. The sound of a kunai piercing flesh was followed by a shrill girl like scream as Gatou fell to the ground nursing his leg. This caused a slight distraction among his thugs which was all the time the six copies of Naruto needed to dispatch them.</p><p>Almost on a whim Naruto went below the deck and came back up with two large duffel bags filled to the brim with ryo. Ignoring a sobbing Gatou, Naruto calmly sealed the bags into an empty scroll before slipping it into his jounin vest. Looking over the horizon Naruto saw that the ship had almost reached the Fire country docks. Almost as if nothing had happened, Naruto walked across the deck, paying no heed to the unconscious bodies of various thugs before looking back at Gatou.</p><p>"You probably don't have a deluxe cabin to begin with." He said in a deadpan. After getting no response the now eleven year old boy jumped off the deck and started running on water like it was a normal day occurrence to see an eleven year old boy perform such an act. Had Naruto glanced back even once, he would have seen a look of utter fury on Gatou's face as he muttered, "Konoha shinobi."</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Three days had passed since Naruto had begun his journey towards the borders of Iwa and Suna, during the long marathon Naruto had crossed the gates of Konoha and was sorely tempted to stop for the afternoon and have a go at Ichiraku's, but was reminded of his sensei's warning and changed directions.</p><p><i>Three hours later….</i></p><p>Naruto had left Konoha two hours ago, now he was moving at a slower pace. After every hundred or so meters, Naruto would stop to lay down triple layered traps for anyone who might be interested in the sword.</p><p>A half an hour and hundreds of traps later Naruto had finally reached the place, it was an old ruin of what seemed to be like a huge tower. Debris littered the ground around it, and because it was at the sand country's border the entire tower was covered in dirt. What once might have been a beautiful piece of architecture had now been ravaged through time. A chill crept down Naruto's spine as he looked at the humongous structure in front of it. With a sense of foreboding Naruto crossed the entrance and entered the tower. In front of him was a large statue that had a crack in it, on either side of it were stairways spiraling up towards the tower. In front of the statue and in between the stairways was a circular platform with was glowing red.</p><p>Keeping his senses on high alert Naruto stepped on the platform…</p><p>WHOOOOSH</p><p>The eleven year old boy was thrown upward with the force of a jutsu…the damned platform was a super trampoline…the fear quickly gave way to excitement as the boy enjoyed the rush. Through the corner of his eyes he noticed several doors rush pass him. As soon as it had begun the joy ride stopped, the lack of inertia left Naruto suspended in mid air before he began to drop, it was only out of reflex that he managed to catch hold of a ledge and flip himself over. Now on top, Naruto looked down and saw the inside of the tower. To his right their was a huge clock like mechanism that seemed to still be in motion even though the tower was nothing but ruins. He looked down and saw that both the staircases lead to this particular point.</p><p>Bracing himself, Naruto turned and looked at the door. It was light blue with metallic bolts marking the boundaries. There were no hinges that gave any indication of how the door opened, tentatively, Naruto reached out and touched the door. Just as his fingers made contact with the wood, the entire scenery around him changed, immediately Naruto dropped into his fighting stance and looked over the room. The entire room was filled with treasure; gold coins glittered in dim torch lights. It seamed that he had been transported to another time altogether, the walls were brighter and free of grime and the door that was supposed to be in front of him was now facing his back. The only assumption was that somehow Naruto had been transported to the room behind the door he was trying to touch.</p><p>Taking a deep breath Naruto searched the room, his crimson eyes rested upon another door directly in front of him, being guarded by two huge headless statues holding their hands together as one would hold a sword, but where a sword should have been was empty blocks of wood. Each statue was ten feet long and seemed to tower above the young boy. As Naruto passed them by, he could not help but shake off the feeling that he was being judged by the two behemoths. Maybe it was his imagination, but the statues were starting to gain color, one was starting to bleed red and the other navy blue.</p><p>With a flash Naruto ran towards the door, before anything weird could happen.</p><p>This time the door transported him into an open corridor. Instead of walls the corridor was supported by pillars, tapestries fluttered around Naruto as he slowly made his way towards another door. The utter silence was getting to the little boy and the lack of any action was starting to make Naruto jumpy. Exactly opposite to Naruto was another door, this one was red in color; somehow Naruto new what was going to happen was going to be the test of all his skill and speed. As he neared the door, Naruto's gaze fell on the sculpture of a man holding a large time piece (the one in which there are two compartments and sand flows in between them) on his back. The weird thing about it was not the object that the man held, but that the entire statue was carved out of gold.</p><p>Tearing his eyes away from the strange piece of art, Naruto one again placed his hand on the door and found himself on a circular passage that lead to the top of the tower. With determined steps Naruto climbed the winding passage and climbed a few stairs to finally reach the top, he hadn't even noticed, but night had fallen. Naruto stepped into a circular arena; all around him were pillars depicting the sculptures of angels in agony. All the angels' eyes seemed to point towards a stone with a metallic object stuck in it. The full moon gave of an eerie light illuminating the blade.</p><p>Naruto had not taken two steps towards the blade when a shimmering portal appeared between him and the blade. A large creature jumped out of the portal and looked at Naruto with intelligent eyes.</p><p>'<i>He's just like Kentaro-sensei said</i>'</p><p>The <i>thing </i>had the face and body of a lion but it had long ears on the top of its head like a dog, which twitched every now and then. Its canines were the size of Naruto's hand. The tail was covered in some sort of armor and tip was shaped like that of a scorpion, and from the back of its front legs, protruded two short wings, like that of a bat.</p><p>The lion or whatever it was looked at Naruto with intelligent eyes, nothing could have prepared Naruto for what was about to happen.</p><p>"<i>I'm sorry young one, but you will go no further." </i>A rumbling voice echoed in Naruto's head.</p><p>"You…what are you? And how did you get into my head?" screamed Naruto.</p><p>"<i>I am a wind rider, but this is no time for pleasantries…please turn back, it goes against my honor to kill a cub."</i></p><p>'<i>He's just like me' </i>Thought Naruto, before narrowing his eyes, "I haven't come all this way to turn back. I will claim that blade you guard."</p><p>"<i>Very well then, I have no choice"</i></p><p>Without wasting another second the Wind rider opened its mouth and sent a jet of green goo towards Naruto who jumped out of the way, the ground below Naruto sizzled as the corrosive property of the acid took its effect. Naruto landed on the ground and shot towards the beast like a bullet. Naruto cocked back his arm in preparation for a punch but was snagged out of the air by a long armored tail. Landing back o his feet, Naruto noticed the tail shrink back to its original length. The beast circled Naruto, looking for an opening to strike,</p><p>'<i>Damnit…can't use my shadow fist, if it hits my clone first with his claws, it'll just extend its tail and stab me.' </i>Thought a frustrated Naruto, '<i>Hmm…the left flank is ope…'</i></p><p>Just as Naruto had thought those words, the wind rider moved to cover its left flank, <i>'Can it read…'</i></p><p>"<i>Your mind…Naruto-kun. Yes, that's my special ability. That's the reason no one has ever managed to defeat me. I know your attacks before you even execute them. You cannot win."</i></p><p>"We'll see about that…you should never have told me about your ability."</p><p>Naruto closed his eyes and opened himself to the world of shadows and concentrated on his adversary. A rush of information filled his head, little details that he hadn't known before were made available to him. The beast was old, almost immortal. It could spew acid from its mouth and a single stab from his tail could kill a man in less than two seconds.</p><p>The beast, thinking that the boy had given up, lunged at him to give the child a painless death, only to find the boy gone.</p><p>Naruto, sensing the rider closing on him had simply teleported away. Clearing his mind of all thoughts, Naruto further opened himself to the world around him and opened his eyes which glowed crimson.</p><p>A growl from the beast told Naruto that his plan had succeeded. The beast could no longer sense his thoughts.</p><p>Man and beast rushed towards each other as they fought. Naruto easily dodged the slashes that were sent his way and the wind rider blocked all of Naruto's punches and kicks by extending his armored tail. Even though the fight was at a stalemate, Naruto's hands were beginning to throb after hitting armored hide.</p><p>Before his opponent could react, Naruto bit both his thumbs; the blood reacted with the seals placed on the thumbs themselves to form a red glow. Quick as a fox, Naruto dodged a stab and slammed his hands onto the ground.</p><p>The ground near his feet cracked as two curved hilts emerged from the ground, not waiting for the blades to emerge, Naruto grabbed the hilts and pulled his blades out, just in time to block the tail and slash at the creature's paw with the other sword. A thin red line appeared in the creature's paw as he gave off a low growl. The wind rider turned and ran towards the edge of the tower and jumped…mid fall it opened its front legs and began to glide, using the thermals from the desert winds the rider turned itself around and spit out a stream of acid.</p><p>In response Naruto rolled out of the way, attached a chakra string to the sword in his left arm and threw it towards the best, just as the sword was about to hit, Naruto sent a pulse of chakra towards the sword's hilt through the chakra strings and cut of the string of chakra.</p><p>An almighty boom rocked the tower as the shockwaves cause a few pillars to fall. Naruto saw the sword falling and pulled it back via a chakra string. Once again looking back towards the sky for any sign of his foe, Naruto saw the beast cover in armor. Its skin was no longer light brown, but silver and metallic. Large spikes of armor covered the creature's mane. The only spaces in the armor were for the wind rider's eyes, wings, claws and over sized teeth.</p><p>The beast reared back and flew straight towards Naruto his maw open wide as a stream of acid erupted straight towards Naruto, by the time Naruto had gotten over his shock the stream was to close to dodge by normal means.</p><p>In a flash blue marking formed on Naruto's skin as he felt fifteen times lighter. The weights on his arms and legs too fell on the ground.</p><p>"<i>You are strong indeed if you forced me to use this form." </i>The wind rider said.</p><p>"So are you. You may just be the strongest fighter I've face yet. Let's see for how long your armor holds out."</p><p>"<i>Let's" </i>Came the ready reply.</p><p>The beast landed on the ground with a thud, and charged towards Naruto, the boy instead over charging, simply smirked and vanished. Naruto reappeared behind the beast, as a shower of sparks erupted from its armor.</p><p>"Impressive" was all Naruto said, before he was forced to dodge the deadly scorpion tail.</p><p>The battle continued for an hour, both Naruto and the wind rider were panting. Deep scratches and bite marks could be seen on Naruto's hands and chest as his jounin vest had been torn apart. On the other hand deep lacerations and depressions could be seen on the creature's armor where Naruto had managed to cut through with his wind chakra or used small explosions.</p><p>"Arrrgh!!! Why won't you give up already?" shouted Naruto</p><p>"<i>Why don't you" said the amused, but tired voice of the sentient beast.</i></p><p>"Take this, <u>Hellfire element: Crimson Blades</u>"</p><p>Naruto shot two blades of wind towards the beast and followed it by shooting two small fireballs from his hands. The fires increased in strength by combining with the wind, and also attained the cutting strength of the wind blade. The crimson blades made their way towards the lion like beast, who managed to avoid the first one but got nicked by the second one.</p><p>"<i>AAAAHHHHHH!!!"</i> the mental scream was so loud that Naruto fell down on his knees.</p><p>The hellfire jutsu had gone passed the armor and hit skin. Naruto could not even imagine what pain his foe would be going through. As the boy watched, the silver sheen of the armor dimmed and the protective hide slowly melted away leaving some bruises and a scar on the beast's hind leg where the jutsu had nicked him. In a berserk state the creature began attacking Naruto relentlessly. The boy who was so fast that he couldn't even be seen was now hard pressed to dodge the strikes. This was how exhausted Naruto was. Finally a slash got through Naruto's defense and struck him on the face. Three deep gauges were etched into the cheeks of the young boy as he was flung towards the edge of the tower.</p><p>Hot blood dripped down his cheek as Naruto blinked through the haze that was clouding his vision. The boy could almost feel the pieces of skin dangling from the remnant if the left side of his face, he could practically feel the demon chakra working overtime to heal him. In a dazed state, Naruto saw the horrified look on the beast's face as it came to grips with what it had done. As his mind was still cloudy, Naruto placed his hand on the ground and muttered, "<u>Shadow Element: Shadow Bind</u>" sending half of his remaining chakra into the attack, chains made out of tendrils of shadow erupted around the wind rider and clamped down on him.</p><p>The beast started to struggle, but went quiet upon hearing another whisper in the night, "<u>Shadow Element: Mass Shadow Spikes</u>"</p><p>A loud roar rang throughout the fading desert as four spikes erupted from below the wind riders legs and nailed him to the ground. Even moving a muscle caused the massive beast to be racked with tremendous pain.</p><p>The beast could make out the shadowy figure of its adversary waling towards him, as Naruto entered the moonlight, the wind rider's eyes widened, there was no sign of him being hit with a single blow except for three small lines on his left cheek. The bare chested boy sat near the beast and put his hand on the wind rider's snout. An involuntary whimper escaped the massive predator the chains and spikes around him disappeared. Both of Naruto's hands glowed green as he passed them over the creature, healing his many wounds.</p><p>"<i>Why?" </i>The single word resonated within Naruto's mind.</p><p>"You should already know, I'm no longer shielding myself from you"</p><p>The beast's eyes widened as the answer became known to him, "<i>You respect me? For having regretted that last blow?</i>"</p><p>"Hai."</p><p>Silence followed as the clouds parted and drops of rain fell on the ground. It must have been a freak weather disturbance, Rain in a desert? Come on!</p><p>"What's your name?" asked Naruto, "Everyone has a name…"</p><p>The wind rider raised his head, his yellow eyes bored into Naruto now not-glowing crimson ones. <i>"My kin…they called me…Kain."</i></p><p>"Used to?" questioned Naruto, while running a hand through Kain's mane.</p><p>"<i>Yes, long ago this blade's power called to me from my homeland. I along with my kin live where all the summoned animals dwell. I was the strongest of my tribe, the blade needed a protector and it sent its power across the worlds. For some reason…I responded. When I reached this place, the blade bound itself to me and trapped me in an alternate dimension. At first it would force me to fight any one who would come seeking it, but when I realized the true power that the blade held, I protected her with all my heart. Now that you have obtained the blade, I am free from her service. Now go…claim you prize, and then come back. I have something to tell you."</i></p><p>Nodding, Naruto got up and went towards the piece of rock in which the blade was embedded. Only the hilt and the lower part of the blade was visible. A single look at the size of the hilt told Naruto that the sword was meant to be wielded with two hands. Oddly though, the hilt was divided into two parts by a metal partition (imagine the hilt being divided into three equal parts. The first part, the part that is connected to the cross guard is separated cut off from the rest of the hilt by a metal barrier). The cross-guard was shaped like the brake of a motorcycle Naruto had once seen in some mangas.</p><p>Tentatively Naruto placed his hand on the upper part of the hilt, his fingers closing beneath the cross-guard. Following his intuition, the blond flicked his wrist to 'rev' up the blade. All of a sudden a red glow surrounded the rock, as the boulder was blasted into a million pieces. The blade pulsated with crimson energy as Naruto finally got to look at the entire sword. The freakin thing was bigger than he was. The sword measured roughly five and a half feet in length. The blade was abnormally large, rather than going straight, the tip of the blade curved slightly upwards. The blade was single edged and on its dull side there was a 'thing' that was raised slightly, and it seemed to be the source of the crimson energy. Experimentally, Naruto squeezed the 'brake' that was a part of the cross guard, and the raised portion of the blade fell down and merged seamlessly with the weapon.</p><p>'<i>So I've finally got a person worthy enough to wield me in battle?' </i>a soft voice spoke lovingly inside Naruto's head.</p><p>A projection of a beautiful woman dressed in red robes appeared before Naruto, the woman had dark straight dark hair that flowed past her shoulders and came to rest just above her cleavage. She had the perfect figure and exuded seductiveness, but her brown eyes held just a fraction of her unfathomable power. She moved towards Naruto, her dress hugging her figure as she approached the young hero.</p><p>"Hime…" muttered an awe-struck boy.</p><p>The woman stopped walking and giggled, the sound of her voice being music to Naruto's ears. <i>'That is not my name, but yes, you can call me that. But I see that you're not ready for my power yet. It seems that you still don't have the utmost confidence in your abilities. A shame really, I'll wait for the day when you need me most Naruto-kun. Until then…'</i></p><p>"No wait…" Naruto lunged forward and tried to stop the beautiful woman, but his hand passed right through the projection and the woman disappeared with a smile on her face. It was much later that Naruto realized, that the sword that he had held in his arm, too had vanished.</p><p>The padded footsteps of Kain were heard as the massive beast reached Naruto, <i>"That woman has a mind of her own. You should be proud that she even chose you." </i>Rumbled Kain, compared to that woman's voice, Kain's tone almost gave him a headache, and for the first time Naruto noticed how huge the beast was, the wind rider was three and a four feet tall and seven feet long from snout to tail.</p><p>"<i>Listen Naruto, usually when a human gains the respect of a summoned animal, they are usually given the summoning contract for that species. However, my clan had decided long ago to never bind themselves to a summoner, therefore whenever an individual human gains the respect of a wind rider, he or she makes the human their partner. It is a two way bond, the wind rider can summon the human to his/her world whenever they are in trouble, similarly, the human too can summon their partner whenever they need them, and by defeating me in a straight and honorable fight…you Uzumaki Naruto, have gained my respect. If you will have me, I'd like to be your partner."</i></p><p>The blond stood stunned, he had received too many shocks in too little time. First he had fought an hour long battle with a beast not of this world, then when he had finally claimed his prize, the spirit of the sword had said that he wasn't ready for her power and subsequently disappeared, <i>then</i> the beast he had defeated earlier wanted to be his partner. It was too much!</p><p>After a minute, Naruto managed to clear his head and gave Kain his answer, "Hai, I would like that Kain-san."</p><p>"<i>Very well then,"</i> came the relieved voice of Kain, <i>"I shall perform the bonding ceremony.</i>"</p><p>Without giving out any intention, Kain lunged at Naruto and managed to catch him by surprise, during the second that it took for Naruto to orient himself, Kain had already stung Naruto in the heart with his tail.</p><p>An icy feeling made its way inside Naruto, who only stared in shock as the kanji for wind tattooed itself right above Naruto's heart. Finally exhausted, the eleven year old boy fell on the ground, not even noticing his kage bunshins popping out of existence.</p><p>"<i>Might as well carry him someplace safe." </i>Said the lion like creature before managing to swing Naruto onto his back and jumping off the edge of the tower, gliding towards the sand country.</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p>Five figures reached the top of the tower a minute after Naruto had departed, and upon noticing the absence of the blade, the one gayish man leading the group screamed to heavens, "Curse you!!"</p><p>For two long hours Orochimaru and his elite guards had been hard pressed to avoid the traps. Set around the blaster tower, it wasn't that the traps were exceedingly well made, but they were so <i>god damn many of them</i>! The group could barely move twenty steps forward before being assaulted by kunais, pebbles, shurikens and even cow dung! As if Tayuya's foul mouth wasn't enough, the group had to deal with foul smells as well!</p><p>But nooo….that wasn't it. When the group had finally made it to the tower, they had to go through the long staircase and pass through a maze of doors before Sakon had accidentally fallen off the ledge only to fly past them moments later. How should have the great Orochimaru known that there was a super trampoline right in plain sight!</p><p>The fates still hadn't had their fill though, just as the group had reached the final door, they were assaulted by two short blondes that kept absorbing their attacks by turning into shadows! It was only when Orochimaru succeeded in blinding one of them with some of the cow dung he had on his robes that they managed to defeat the duo, only to find out that they were kage bunshins! And on top of that the bloody sword was missing.</p><p>With a sigh, Orochimaru turned towards the three male members of his group. His long tongue came out, licking his lips. Atleast he still had Jiroubu, Kidoumaru and Sakon to play with…"Kukukuku"</p><p><b>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</b></p><p><b>A/N: How was it??
