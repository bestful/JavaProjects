Naruto is own by Masashi Kishimoto and Knight Rider is own by NBC . I don't make money off this story.</p><p>Inside the village Hidden in the Leafs Seven year old Naruto Uzumaki was running away from a mob of villagers that were out to kill him for some reason he couldn't figure out. Naruto was running as fast as he could when one of the villagers throw a bottle at him that hit him in the head and sent him to the ground hard. Naruto was then beaten and stab with weapons the villagers had on them.</p><p>"Why are you doing this to me?" shouted Naruto crying</p><p>"You know very well why demon." replied one of the villagers with venom slamming his foot into Naruto's back hard.</p><p>With that the man pick him up and the other villagers follow him to a old well outside the village. The two Chunin's guarding the gates let them pass as they hated the Kyuubi Brat as well. Once they got there the man lifted Naruto over his head and face the crowed.</p><p>"Today we will send this demon back to hell from where he belongs." shouted the man</p><p>The villagers let out a cheer.</p><p>"You see this ancient well behind me which was built long before the first and second Hokage came here to form the village will be his tomb as the well has wet and slippery walls and even if the demon survives his fall he will not live very long as this well absorbs chakra and of course since the Kyuubi is a beast of chakra and is sealed in this weak form we can throw it down there and let it die once and for all." said the Man</p><p>With that the man held Naruto over the well and said "Now die demon." and threw Naruto down the well. The crowed then cheered again until they heard a loud roar say " What the hell have you done?"</p><p>Everyone turn around and saw the Third Hokage coming towards them with a angry look on his face and before anyone could say anything Sarutobi went over to the man and punch him hard in the stomach that knock him out.</p><p>"Anbu I want you all to arrest these villagers at once and arrest the two chunin at the gates as well and bring them to Anko to be integrated for answers as to why they allow this to happen." order Sarutobi to the Anbu that appeared</p><p>"As you wish Lord Hokage." said the leader of the Anbu</p><p>With that the Anbu arrested all the villagers and the two Chunin and left. Sarutobi then turn towards the well and fell to his knees and cried.</p><p>"Naruto I am so sorry that I couldn't protect you like I promise your parents." said Sarutobi letting a few tears fall</p><p>With that Sarutobi got up and headed back to his office as there was nothing he could do for Naruto now as the well drain all chakra. As he headed towards his office no one dared go near him as the villagers had never seen there leader so angry before. Sarutobi had now had it with the villagers and would make sure the people who had killed Naruto would be punish severely for robbing a innocent boy of his future of being a ninja and finding acceptance . Meanwhile Naruto had woken up and discovered he was inside a well and that all his wounds had healed and he look around again and saw he in what look like a metal tunnel put into the rock and that it continued into the darkness for some distance.</p><p>"Hello can anybody hear me?" shouted Naruto scared</p><p>All of a sudden electric lights came on inside the tunnel and Naruto saw what look like a door up ahead. Naruto who was now scared but having no where else to go decided to venture further down the tunnel and to the door up ahead. When Naruto got to the door it suddenly open up and Naruto went through it and into a large room. The door then close behind him and then more electric lights came on and Naruto saw that he was in a very large room that was made out of metal and look more strange then any other place he had ever seen before. Naruto look around the room and saw there were what look like once white sheets covering over desks . Naruto went over to one of the desk and pulled the sheet off and saw what look like television with strange equipment attach to it. Naruto then look up and saw there was a huge screen in front of him on the wall.</p><p>"Is there anybody In here?" ask Naruto curious</p><p>All of a sudden Naruto saw what look like a huge piece of black metal on wheels and had what look like a picture of a horse on the front end of it.</p><p>"Is anybody here? Because I just want to go back to the village and see old man Hokage." ask Naruto more scared</p><p>"Who are you?" said a robotic voice</p><p>"Who said that?" ask Naruto scared</p><p>"That would be me behind you." replied the voice</p><p>All of a sudden Naruto look in the direction of the voice and saw it was coming from the Piece of metal behind him and saw red lights flashing back and forth on the front of it.</p><p>"Who or what are you?" shouted Naruto scared</p><p>"I am Knights Industries Three Thousand or K.I.T.T. For short and who are you may I ask?" replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>"I am Naruto Uzumaki of the Village Hidden in the Leafs." said Naruto to K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Wait one moment please Naruto." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>With that Naruto watch as the huge screen on the wall lit up and number started to flash to on it. What Naruto didn't know was that K.I.T.T. was checking the mainframe of the Knights Industries computers that had stored all the information over the past millennia since the computer and him were shut down but the hidden cameras had kept on recording everything that had happen during that time and had recorded all the information on every event and Justu all over the Elemental Countries. Just because him and the main computer were down didn't mean the eyes had stop watching.</p><p>"Naruto." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Yes." replied Naruto</p><p>"I have much to tell you and it maybe to terrible for you to hear. But I think you have been deceive long enough." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>With that K.I.T.T. told Naruto the truth that the Kyuubi had been sealed inside of him. The Fourth being his father and his mother Kushina who had died during childbirth. K.I.T.T. then Naruto the footage of his father and mother how happy they were about Kushina being pregnant with him. The news of the Kyuubi attack. His father's turmoil while wrestling with the fact that there was only one way to stop the demon and how it broke his and Kushina heart for about what they were going to do. He saw his mother Kushina holding him in her arms saying how much she love him and his father. Naruto then saw his father the fourth Hokage appearing on the toad boss Gamabunta's head and sealing the Kyuubi in him and saying he sorry he was for doing this to Naruto and telling Sarutobi that he wanted Naruto to be seen as a hero. The old man's meeting with the counsel and how they called for his death and the old man refuse and made a law so Naruto could live a normal life and change his last name to his mother so his father's enemies couldn't come after him and kill him. Once it was all over K.I.T.T. saw that Naruto was crying over as he was both happy and sad that he had parents who loved him and the fact he was the Kyuubi Container and that the old man had tried to protect him from evil people.</p><p>K.I.T.T. just waited for Naruto to speak up. All of a sudden Naruto look at K.I.T.T. with what was left of his tears.</p><p>"Thank you very much K.I.T.T. I know what I must do. I will become Hokage not for acceptance or love but for what my parents and the old man stood for." said Naruto</p><p>K.I.T.T. was surprise at Naruto's reaction. He figured that Naruto would declare war on the village for what happen to him. But Naruto had decided to chose the path of the protector instead.</p><p>"He is just like you Micheal." thought K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Naruto." said K.I.T.T. getting Naruto full attention</p><p>"Yes K.I.T.T. ." said Naruto</p><p>"Naruto I am a machine built by a organization called Knight's Industries whose mission was to protect the world from evil people and I had a partner whose name was Micheal Knight who lose his father the original Micheal Knight to a great evil not as bad as this Kyuubi but evil none the less. Like you Micheal decide to protect this world from evil and continue his father's legacy to protect the weak and innocent from evil people." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>With that K.I.T.T. showed Naruto footage of a young man driving K.I.T.T. and defeating many evil people and stop them from destroying the world with strange weapons and plans to kill innocent people. After the footage was over K.I.T.T. look over to Naruto.</p><p>"Naruto I believe you should take up the duty of defending this world from evil people who threaten it and protect the weak and innocent people as I have seen your life and I think my partner Micheal Knight would be proud if you took on his legacy. So will you do it Naruto? Will you become Micheal Knight the new Knight Rider and my partner?" ask K.I.T.T.</p><p>Naruto look thoughtful for a minute and look at K.I.T.T. and smiled.</p><p>"YES I will K.I.T.T. ." replied Naruto</p><p>It now had been three weeks since Naruto's "Death" and the Hokage true to his word hadeveryone of the villagers that were involve in killing Naruto be put to death or put in prison for the rest of their life's . The counsel had tried to speak up but Sarutobi would have no of it. The rest of the villagers were keeping quiet as not to make the Hokage angry but all of them were glad that the demon had been killed. The only two people in the village who were sad were Itachi and Sakura as both young girls had like Naruto and did not care what the villagers thought about him.</p><p>During those three weeks K.I.T.T. was training Naruto and had taught Naruto the Shadow clone jutsu and many other jutsu as well that were on the main computer. Naruto was now slighty taller then a average seven year old boy. The next step for Naruto to become the next Micheal Knight was K.I.T.T. had decided to give Naruto a new bloodline as he would need it as the people Naruto would be facing would be a lot tougher then anyone the last Micheal Knight face. K.I.T.T. had taken the D.N.A. Of the Uchiha clan along with another clan that could make ice and added some nanobots to it. This new bloodline would allow Naruto to have the Sharingan and able to make ice without using any handsigns as well using the nanobots in his body to make any type of weapon using them. With that K.I.T.T. with help from one of the Robotic arms in the room injected the new bloodline into Naruto and before Naruto fell to sleep. K.I.T.T. decide to say something.</p><p>"Naruto if we are successful in giving you this new bloodline trait. Then you continue to train until your 12 years old and we can begin to search for my evil twin K.A.R.R. ." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>"You mean you have a evil twin somewhere that is like you?" ask Naruto surprise</p><p>"Yes I do Naruto and it is urgent that we find out where he is before any evil ninja find him and use him to harm innocent people." replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>"I promise you K.I.T.T. we will find where K.A.R.R. Is at and I am thinking if we reform Knight Industries then we can use the equipment here to locate him." said Naruto</p><p>"Thank you very much Naruto for that idea. But you should get some rest as it will be a few days before you will recover and your new bloodline becomes active." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>With that Naruto laid his head on the bed and fell asleep and K.I.T.T. monitor Naruto's vital signs on the computer screens.</p><p><u>Inside Naruto's Mindscape</u></p><p>Naruto woke up to see he was inside a large chamber . It look like a larger version of the main room where K.I.T.T. was in but there was large cage in front of him. Naruto then walk over to the cage and saw a young woman about twenty with long black hair with blood red and silver streaks was tied in a ponytail that came down to her knees and she wearing a blood red kimono . Her skin was slightly tan and her lips wore no make up but look slightly red. But what startled Naruto the most was that she had red slitted eyes like a fox with flecks of silver,gold, and sapphire blue and she had two fox ears where her normal ears would be fold back and had nine long red foxtails coming out of a small hole in her kimono where her tailbone would be.</p><p>The women then look up at Naruto and tried to smile. But a lone tear came down her face and she look away.</p><p>"Kyuubi?" ask Naruto</p><p>"Yes I am the Kyuubi no Kitsune , The nine tailed fox demon and..." She then felled to her knees and started to cry. "I am so sorry Naruto." said Kyuubi crying</p><p>Naruto didn't know how to react. He thought the Kyuubi was male for one and he never expected for her to cry and apologize. Naruto not knowing what to do made his way over through the bars and towards Kyuubi. Kyuubi consume with her crying didn't notice Naruto coming over to her until she felt his arms wrap around her.</p><p>"Shhh It's okay Kyuubi -Chan." said Naruto trying to calm her down</p><p>Kyuubi blush at Naruto calling her Kyuubi-Chan and clutch Naruto's shirt and cried into his chest.</p><p>"Why? Why don't you hate me? I ruin your life. I killed innocent people. I am a monster." Kyuubi wailed</p><p>"Because I think your not a monster Kyuubi-Chan as I can see it in your eyes." replied Naruto</p><p>When Naruto said that Kyuubi calm down and blush a deeper shade of red.</p><p>"Thank you for saying that Naruto-Kun." said Kyuubi calming down</p><p>"Don't mention it Kyuubi -Chan. But can you tell me why you attack the village in the first place?" ask Naruto</p><p>"I was trick Naruto-Kun." replied Kyuubi knowing it to be the truth even how unlikely he would be believe her.</p><p>"By who?" ask Naruto</p><p>" By a ninja with snake like eyes . He tried ti inject me with a curse seal and torture me with great pain until I fell in a rage and went after him and ran into the Leaf Village and well they attack me and I attack back. " Tear then form into her eyes. "If I was only stronger then all those innocent people and your parents would not have died because of me." said Kyuubi begin to cry again</p><p>All of a sudden Naruto hug her tighter and wipe the tears from her eyes.</p><p>"Don't say that Kyuubi it wasn't your fault. It's was his. I don't blame you and neither would the Hokage if he knew." said Naruto</p><p>"Thanks you for understanding me Naruto." said Kyuubi</p><p>"Don't mention it Kyuubi. I promise you I will find a way to free you from this seal and I hope you can help me with my training to become the new Knight Rider and I will make sure the man who did this to you will pay for what he did." said Naruto</p><p>"Thank you very much Naruto and I promise I will help you in your training no matter what." said Kyuubi</p><p>All of a sudden Naruto felt a pain in his arm and Kyuubi notice it.</p><p>"Naruto-Kun what is wrong?" ask Kyuubi</p><p>"It's that injection that K.I.T.T. put into me to activate my new bloodline. Kyuubi I need your healing powers to make it through this." replied Naruto looking at Kyuubi</p><p>"You can count on me Naruto." replied Kyuubi</p><p>With that Kyuubi contracted hard and her chakra wrap around Naruto helping him heal and integrate his new D.N.A. . When the pain stop Naruto look at Kyuubi and smiled . Kyuubi who was tired smiled back at Naruto. Naruto then felt himself starting to wake up.</p><p>"Kyuubi-Chan. I am starting to wake up. But I will come back here and talk to you later." said Naruto</p><p>"I will be waiting right here for you Naruto-Kun." replied Kyuubi smiling</p><p>With that Naruto faded away and Kyuubi smiled knowing that she had someone who loved her.</p><p><u>Back in the Real World</u></p><p>Naruto woke up in the bed and look at K.I.T.T.</p><p>"So K.I.T.T. did everything go as plan with my new bloodline?" ask Naruto</p><p>"Yes it has Naruto. But I think you should try to see if it is active by channeling chakra through your body and see what happens." replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>With that Naruto did as K.I.T.T. said and channel chakra through his body. Naruto's eyes then turn red with three teardrops in them. Naruto then tried making ice by channeling charka into his hands and a small spear of ice came flying out of his hand. Finally Naruto channeled Chakra into his arms and image his arm turning into a sword and he saw his arm turn into a long blade of a sword and then Naruto thought about his arm turning back to normal and it went back to being a normal arm.</p><p>"Looks like it was a success K.I.T.T." said Naruto smiling</p><p>"That is good to know Naruto. But you should get some rest as you have more training to do for the five years before you return to the village and become a ninja." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Yes I do K.I.T.T. . But I think I will go the name Micheal Knight so I can get use to using it." said Naruto</p><p>"That's sound's like a logical plan to do." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Yes it is K.I.T.T. and when I return to the village and become a ninja. Then me and you will start our search for K.A.R.R. Before any evil ninja can find him and we will destroy him once and for all." said Naruto</p><p>"And of course I will find a way to free Kyuubi-Chan from her seal no matter what and as the new Knight Rider I will make sure no more innocent people will die by the hands of evil." thought Naruto</p><p>That's it for this chapter. So what do you think of the first chapter. The reason I did this crossover is because no one has done it before and I love Naruto and the new Knight Rider T.V. Series as well. As Always please review and leave Comments as I want people's thought's on this story. Thanks and stay tune for the next chapter</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Stranded Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto
or Knight Rider. Naruto is own by Masashi Kishimoto and Knight Rider
is own by NBC. I don't make money off this story.</P><P><U>Five Years Later</U></P><P>Outside the
gates of the Hidden Leaf village two Chunin were standing guard on
the lookout for intruders. When all of a sudden one of them saw
something black coming towards them at a fast speed.</P><P>"What the hell
is that thing coming towards us?" ask the first Chunin</P><P>"I don't know
what that thing is. But we better be prepare for a fight as it is
coming towards us and it could be bad news for the village."
replied the other Chunin</P><P>All of a sudden
the thing came closer to them and the gate and they could see it was
on wheels and then just before it was about to hit them it stop right
in front of them. Unknow to the Chunin the thing that had stop in
front them was no other then K.I.T.T. who had stop in front of them
before he could cause the two Chunin any harm. The two Chunin could
make out what look like two people inside of K.I.T.T. and they decide
to see who these people were that almost hit them. With that both
Chunin went over to K.I.T.T. and the first Chunin that had saw
K.I.T.T. tap on the window.</P><P>"Ah excuse me
sir can you rolled down the window so we can see who you are?" ask
the First Chunin</P><P>With that the
window rolled down and sitting in the driver seat of K.I.T.T. was a
12 year old boy with dark dirty blond hair wearing a long sleeve blue
shirt,blue jeans and white sneakers with black sunglasses over his
eyes. The boy then took off his sunglasses to reveal he had dark
emerald green eyes and he look at the two Chunin.</P><P>"Is there a
problem sir?" ask the boy</P><P>"Yes there is
a problem. You almost hit me and my friend here with this piece of
metal." replied the other Chunin</P><P>"Well I am
very sorry that I almost hit the two of you with my friend K.I.T.T.
here as sometimes he likes to drive fast down the roads." said the
boy</P><P>"Who is this
K.I.T.T.?" ask the first Chunin</P><P>"That would be
me standing next to you." replied K.I.T.T</P><P>"Okay I didn't
just hear this piece of metal talk." said the other Chunin with
eyes in shock looking at K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Actually you
did hear K.I.T.T. talk." said the boy</P><P>"How is that
possible?" ask the first Chunin</P><P>"Well maybe it
is because K.I.T.T. here happens to be a special type of summon that
my boyfriend here learn to summon." said the woman next to the boy
who had black hair with blood red and silver streaks wearing a red
shirt and blue jeans and black sneakers with sunglasses over her
eyes.</P><P>"I guess that
would explain it then. But care to tell us why you two are doing here
outside the village gates?" ask the other Chunin</P><P>"Well we are
here as I need to talk to your Hokage about me becoming a ninja of
your village." said the boy</P><P>"Well you two
can't enter our village without the proper identification." said
the first Chunin</P><P>"We do have
the right identification." said the boy handing the Chunin two I.D.
Cards</P><P>With that the
Chunin look at the I.D. Cards and saw that they said the boy's name
was Micheal Knight and the woman's name was Kyuubi Fuuma saying they
were from the Land of Rain.</P><P>"Look's like
everything is in order here you two. Sorry about holding the both of
you up. But we had to make sure you were not here to harm the
village." said the First Chunin</P><P>"Well that is
okay. You two were just doing your job protecting the village from
harm." said Micheal</P><P>"Yeah we don't
have a problem with the two of you doing your job." said Kyuubi</P><P>"Well thank
you two and we both hope you enjoy you stay here in the village."
said the other Chunin</P><P>With that the
Chunin open the gates to the village.</P><P>"Well it was a
pleasure meeting the both of you." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that
Micheal and Kyuubi drove K.I.T.T through the gates into the village .
Meanwhile in the rebuilt Knight Industries a boy in his late teens
with silver hair pulled into a ponytail and wearing glasses was
watching the huge screen in front of him showing the footage from the
Knight Industries Satellite showing that Micheal and Kyuubi had
driven into the village with K.I.T.T. and he was smiling.</P><P>"Looks like
those I.D. Cards I gave you and Kyuubi Micheal work like a charm."
said the boy</P><P>"What did you
expect Kabuto. You are the best at making fake I.D.'s that can fool
the best ninja." said Micheal voice over the speakers.</P><P>"Yeah those
Chunin think we came from the Land of Rain and let the both of us and
K.I.T.T. into the village." added Kyuubi</P><P>"Well your
forgetting that Kabuto here had some help in making those fake I.D. 
Of your's." said a girl in her late teens with dark pink hair that
came down to her shoulders and black eyes sitting next to Kabuto</P><P>"Of course we
didn't forget you Tayuya. We couldn't inside the village without you
helping Kabuto make those fake I.D.'s ." said Micheal</P><P>"Well thanks
for remembering me you two." said Tayuya</P><P>"Don't mention
it." said Kyuubi</P><P>Are you two done
talking to Micheal and Kyuubi?" ask a voice</P><P>Kabuto and
Tayuya turn around and saw a man with black hair and wearing a black
business suit and saw he look unhappy and had the Sharingan blazing
in his eyes.</P><P>"Were very
sorry Mr. Madara Uchiha." replied Kabuto</P><P>"Yeah we were
just making sure that Micheal and Kyuubi got into the village safely
with K.I.T.T. ." added Tayuya</P><P>"Well it looks
like to me you two were just shooting the breeze. You both know we
need to contract on finding out where K.A.R.R. is before anyone like
the likes of Orochimaru find him and uses him to harm innocent
people. Which is why the two of are working as double agents to tell
us what is he up to and if he intends to find K.A.R.R. . " said
Madara</P><P>"Don't blame
the two of them for slacking off Madara. They were just making sure
the three of us were alright." said Micheal on the screen</P><P>"Well then I
guess I can let them off this time. But they better pay attention
better if we need to find out where K.A.R.R. is located. Konan what
is the status of K.I.T.T.?" ask Madara looking over to a woman in
her twenties with purple hair tied in a bun with a paper flower in
it.</P><P>"Well
everything so far shows that K.I.T.T. is at 100 percent operational
status so far Mr. Madara." replied Konan</P><P>"That's good
to know. Now Micheal you and Kyuubi better be careful on this
mission. The only reason you are in the village to become a ninja is
to find out where K.A.R.R. is located and destroy him before he can
harm any innocent people. And make sure this time you and Kyuubi
don't do anything crazy like on your last assignment as when you both
did K.I.T.T. had to be repaired for a week not to mention I had to
tell your mother Tsunade about that crazy stunt you pulled with
K.I.T.T. capturing those missing ninja." said Madara</P><P>"Don't worry
about me Madara. I will not pulled anything like that stunt again."
replied Micheal smiling</P><P>All of a sudden
there was a commotion in the room and a woman who appeared to be
about in her twenties or early thirties with blond hair pulled in two
ponytails and brown eyes came towards Madara with a angry look on her
face and was being followed by a young woman with short black hair
and black eyes trying to calm her down.</P><P>"Madara. Where
the hell is my son Micheal this time?" ask the Woman</P><P>"If you must
know Tsunade he is on assignment in the village with Kyuubi and
K.I.T.T. trying to find out where K.A.R.R. is." replied Madara</P><P>"Then I want
to talk to him right now before he ends up grounded again for not
telling me he was on assignment." said Tsunade holding her fist up</P><P>"Lady Tsunade
please calm down. I am sure Micheal is okay and probably didn't want
to tell you he was assignment again as you would try to stop him from
going." said the woman next to her</P><P>"Shizune right
Lady Tsunade. Micheal is alright and if you want to talk to him he is
on the screen and in contact with us right now." said Kabuto</P><P>"Then let me
speak to him then Kabuto." said Tsunade</P><P>With that Kabuto
move aside from his counsel and Tsunade went over to it and saw
Micheal on the screen.</P><P>"Micheal
Knight who the hell do you think you are for not telling me you were
on assignment in the Village?" demanded Tsunade</P><P>"Well if you
must know mom. The reason I didn't tell you is because I figured you
would try to stop me again like you try to do everytime I have a
assignment given to me by Madara." replied Micheal</P><P>"You know
Micheal that I am just worried about your well being ever since I
adopted you when you were eight and you reform Knight Industries. So
all I am asking that you just be careful on this assignment and not
get hurt." said Tsunade</P><P>"I promise I
will mom." said Micheal</P><P>"I will make
sure Tsunade that Micheal comes back in one piece no matter what."
said Kyuubi</P><P>"Don't worry
about Micheal Mrs. Senju. I will make sure that him and Kyuubi are
safe on this mission." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that
Micheal turn off the communication line and the screen went blank.</P><P>"I hope
Micheal doesn't get himself hurt or Tsunade will take it out on me
again. I swear sometimes Micheal just gets himself hurt just so
Tsunade takes her anger out on me." thought Madara rolling his eyes
over.</P><P>Meanwhile
K.I.T.T. had come to a stop in front of the Hokage's tower. Micheal
then turn to Kyuubi.</P><P>"Kyuubi I want
you to stay here with K.I.T.T. while I go talk to old man Hokage."
said Micheal</P><P>"Why do I have
to stay here with K.I.T.T. while you go talk to old man Hokage?"
ask Kyuubi</P><P>"Because when
I talk to him about me releasing you from the seal. There might be
Anbu around the area and even though you are in a transformation
jutsu to hide your fox ears and tails. They might arrest you and be
killed by the counsel's orders and I don't want that to happen as I
don't want to lose the woman I love." replied Micheal</P><P>"I guess I can
understand that Micheal-Kun. But just be careful with the old man as
him and the village thinks your dead." said Kyuubi</P><P>"Don't worry
about me Kyuubi-Chan . I have face worse enemies before and I always
come out on top." replied Micheal giving Kyuubi a kiss on the lips
to reassure her which made Kyuubi blush a bright red</P><P>"K.I.T.T. I
want you to watch over Kyuubi and guard her with your life while I go
talk to old man Hokage. Is that understood?" said Micheal</P><P>"I understand
Micheal and you have my promise no harm will come to her." replied
K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that
Micheal put his sunglasses on and went out the door and headed inside
the Hokage's tower. Once Micheal was inside he went up the stairs and
after going up a few fleets came to the outside the Hokage office and
knock on the door and heard a voice say come in and Micheal open the
door and went into the Hokage's office. At that moment the Hokage was
sitting in his office filling out paperwork and thinking about how it
had been five years since Naruto's "Death" when he heard a knock
at his door and he told whoever it was to come in thinking it had to
be one of his Jonin about who they would have on their squad. When
the door open instead of one of the his Jonin a 12 year old boy with
dark dirty blond hair wearing a long sleeve blue shirt and blue jeans
with white sneakers and sunglasses over his eyes came into the room
and Sarutobi had a feeling he had met this boy before but couldn't
place where he met him.</P><P>"What can I do
for you young man?" ask Sarutobi</P><P>"Well I am
here old man Hokage to become a ninja of this village like I plan on
doing when I was younger." replied Micheal taking off his
sunglasses revealing his dark emerald green eyes smiling</P><P>"How come you
called old man Hokage? The only person who ever called me that has
been dead for the last five years. Who are you young man?" ask
Sarutobi confuse</P><P>"I have always
called you that ever since I was three and who do you think I am old
man. I am the one who painted your robes all pink when I was five as
a prank." replied Micheal giving Sarutobi a fox grin on his face</P><P>"Naruto is
that you. But how can you be alive when your suppose to be dead for
the past five years?" ask Sarutobi shock</P><P>"Well it is a
long story old man Hokage and I go the name Micheal Knight now. So do
you think you can sealed off this room as what I am about to tell you
maybe hard to believe." replied Micheal</P><P>"Oh course
anything for you." said Sarutobi</P><P>With that
Sarutobi made some handsigns and the room glowed a blue color.</P><P>"Alright now
no one can hear us. So tell me where you have been and how come you
did come back until now?" ask Sarutobi</P><P>With that
Micheal told the Hokage about how after he was thrown down the well
he ended up in the remains of Knight Industries where he met K.I.T.T.
who told him about his parents and how his father sealed Kyuubi in
him and how K.I.T.T. gave him a new bloodline trait and met Kyuubi
who told him why she attack the village . He also told the Hokage
about K.I.T.T.'s evil twin K.A.R.R. and how it was important they
need to find him before anyone like Orochimaru found him and harm any
innocent people. And finally how he reform Knight Industries and how
he and K.I.T.T. were now a team like him and the last Micheal Knight
were and had saved countless life's in trying to find K.A.R.R. .
After Micheal finish his story Sarutobi had a look of shock on his
face from hearing the story.</P><P>"That is some
story Micheal. But how come you look so different from what you use
to look like five years ago as I can tell this is not a
transformation jutsu." ask Sarutobi</P><P>"Well you see
old man Hokage K.I.T.T. decided I need to change my appearance so no
one to recognize me so K.I.T.T. had the machines in the lab of Knight
Industries change the color of my hair and eyes and the reason I
don't have my whisker marks anymore is because when I freed Kyuubi
from her seal they disappeared." replied Micheal</P><P>"You mean
Kyuubi is free from the seal?" ask Sarutobi shock</P><P>"Yes she is
old man Hokage and she is now my girlfriend and is here with K.I.T.T.
outside under a transformation jutsu so no one can tell she is free.
But that is not important right now. I need to become a ninja of this
village so I can go missions and try to find out where K.A.R.R. is
located before anyone finds him before me and K.I.T.T. get to him
first and destroy him once and for all." replied Micheal</P><P>"How evil is
this K.A.R.R. ?" ask Sarutobi concern</P><P>"He has all
the same abilities as K.I.T.T. . But instead of protecting innocent
people like K.I.T.T.. He is pure evil and isn't above killing
innocent life's just to get what he wants. Which is why the sooner I
become a ninja of the village the sooner me and K.I.T.T. can find
K.A.R.R. before anyone can get hurt or killed." replied Micheal</P><P>"I can
understand what you want Micheal. But I can't just make you a ninja
of this village without knowing if you had any training in the ninja
arts." said Sarutobi</P><P>"Well it is a
good thing that I have been training to be a ninja then old man since
I was seven with K.I.T.T.'s help teaching me all the jutsu from all
over the Elemental Countries." said Micheal</P><P>"You mean this
K.I.T.T. train you to be a ninja? So how powerful already?" ask
Sarutobi curious</P><P>"Yes K.I.T.T.
train me and as of how powerful I am. According to K.I.T.T. and
Kyuubi I am already at the Kage level already with the training I
went through with them." replied Micheal</P><P>"That's is
impressive to hear. So knowing this for a fact I can make you a ninja
of this village but you will have to work your way up the ranks."
said Sarutobi</P><P>"That's is all
I ask for old man and I will work hard to make you and my parents
proud of me." said Micheal</P><P>"That's is
good to hear Micheal. Now take this note to the academy and show it
to Iruka and it will tell him you are to be place on a Genin team
with other Genin as today is the team assignments and this key here
is to your father's estate where you,Kyuubi and K.I.T.T. will be
staying as I think you deserve to live there since you are Minato and
Kushina son." said Sarutobi handing Micheal a letter and a key with
a leaf headband which Micheal tied around his left arm</P><P>"Thank you old
man Hokage. I promise I will make you proud of me." said Micheal
bowing</P><P>With that
Micheal went out the office leaving Sarutobi with a smile on his
face.</P><P>"He is just
like his father Minato always willing to help people in need."
thought Sarutobi</P><P>Meanwhile Kyuubi
was getting worried about Micheal as was K.I.T.T. when all of a
sudden Micheal came out of the tower and got inside K.I.T.T. and
Kyuubi threw her arms around Micheal.</P><P>"Micheal I am
glad you are alright. So how did everything go with the Hokage?"
ask Kyuubi leting go of Micheal</P><P>"Everything
went great Kyuubi. Old man Hokage made me a ninja of the village and
I have to get going to the academy right now so I can meet my
teammates and my Jonin Sensei." replied Micheal showing Kyuubi his
leaf headband</P><P>With that
Micheal put K.I.T.T. in drive and they headed towards the ninja
academy. After 5 minutes of driving K.I.T.T. came to a stop in front
of the ninja academy.</P><P>"Kyuubi while
I am inside the academy meeting my teammates and Jonin Sensei. I want
you and K.I.T.T. to head over to my parents house and relax until I
come back later to meet the two of you." said Micheal</P><P>"You got it
Micheal-Kun and good luck with meeting your teammates and Sensei."
said Kyuubi</P><P>"Thanks
Kyuubi.-Chan I will see you and K.I.T.T later." replied Micheal</P><P>"Micheal
before you go I think you might need your dragon headed Kantana and
Excailbur as well as your ninja weapons since you may need them."
suggested K.I.T.T.</P><P>"I think you
maybe right K.I.T.T. . I may need them in case something bad
happens." said Micheal</P><P>With that
Micheal got out and went K.I.T.T.'s trunk and took out his dragon
headed Kantana that had a snow white blade and gold dragon's head
encrusted with jewels in a red sheath and then he took out the
legendary sword Excailbur that he found in a old tomb while on one of
his assignments with K.I.T.T. and Kyuubi and knew it was Excailbur as
Micheal had read the story of King Arthur. The blade was bright
silver color and the hilt was gold and encrusted with gemstones and
scabbard was a black color and Micheal attach both swords to his left
hip and finally Micheal took out his pouch full of his ninja weapons
and attach it to his right hip. With that Micheal close the trunk and
headed towards the ninja academy while K.I.T.T. drove off with Kyuubi
to his parents house. Meanwhile inside the classroom all of the
students were sitting down listening to Iruka call out the members of
each squad and in the front row was Itachi and Sakura waiting for
Iruka to call their names to see if they would be place on the same
squad.</P><P>"Man I hope we
get put on the same squad Sakura." said Itachi</P><P>"Yeah I know
what you mean Itachi it would be nice but it will be only the two of
us. I just wish Naruto was here right now as I know he would be so
excited if he was on our team." replied Sakura sadly</P><P>"I know what
you mean Sakura. But that can't happen since Naruto died five years
ago and everyone in the village expect for us and Lord Hokage were
happy he died." said Itachi sadly as well</P><P>With that both
girls look at Iruka Sensei as he calling out the names of the final
team.</P><P>"Alright team
seven will be Itachi Uchiha and Sakura Haruno and your Jonin Sensei
will be." started Iruka</P><P>Before Iruka
could finish the door of the classroom open and Micheal came in and
all the girls in the classroom started to go dreamy eye looking at
Micheal.</P><P>"Sorry to
interrupt you all. But do you know where I can find a Iruka Sensei?"
ask Micheal</P><P>"That would be
me young man and who are you and why did you just barge into my class
when I am in the middle of placing these genin on teams?" replied
Iruka annoyed</P><P>"The names
Micheal Knight Iruka Sensei and the reason I interrupted is because I
just became a genin of your village by your Hokage and he sent me
here with a letter to give you to tell you that I am to be place on a
team with other Genin." replied Micheal handing Iruka the Hokage's
letter</P><P>After studying
the letter for a minute Iruka look at Micheal.</P><P>"This is
definitely the Hokage handwriting here so I guess that means you will
have to be place on a team. Ino." said Iruka</P><P>"Yes Iruka
Sensei." replied a girl with long platinum blond hair tied in a
ponytail and dark blue eyes</P><P>"I am going to
be placing you on the same team with Itachi,Sakura, and Micheal here
according to the Hokage letter here and you and the other will have
two Jonin instructors who are Anko and Kurenai. Is that understood."
said Iruka</P><P>"Yes I
understand you Iruka Sensei." said Ino</P><P>"Good now
Micheal go take a seat next to your new teammates and your two Jonin
Instructors will be here soon to pick you all up." said Iruka</P><P>"As you wish
Iruka Sensei." replied Micheal</P><P>With that
Micheal went over to where Ino,Sakura,and Itachi were and took a seat
next to Sakura and Iruka left the room to take a rest for the day. As
they were waiting Itachi,Sakura, and Ino were looking at Micheal each
with a blush on their faces and curious looks. Sakura decide to speak
up.</P><P>"Excuse
Micheal." said Sakura</P><P>"Yes what can
I do for you Sakura?" ask Micheal</P><P>"Me and my
friends were wondering where do you come?" replied Sakura curious</P><P>"Well if you
must know I am from the Land of Rain and me and my friend Kyuubi came
here to live and for me to become a ninja of your village as it was
always a dream of mine to be a ninja of the Hidden Leaf village."
replied Micheal taking off his sunglasses revealing his dark emerald
eyes</P><P>"How come you
have such dark green eyes Micheal?" ask Ino curious</P><P>"Because it is
part of my bloodline trait and makes any member of my clan have these
color eyes Ino." replied Micheal</P><P>"I guess that
would explain it. But how long have you been training to become a
ninja?" ask Itachi</P><P>"Well if you
must know I have being train almost all my life to become a ninja."
replied Micheal giving the three girls a killer fox grin</P><P>When Micheal
gave them his smile all three girls started to blush like mad.</P><P>"Man I can't
believe this guy is on our team. He is so much cuter then Sasuke."
thought Sakura</P><P>"I wonder if
Micheal makes all the girls blush like he is making us do. He is
definitely a hot guy." thought Itachi</P><P>"I wonder if
he has any girlfriends that he is not telling us. I sure hope he does
not. Because I think I just fell in love." thought Ino smiling</P><P>Al of a sudden
the door of the classroom flew open and everyone turn in the
direction of the door and saw two women come into the room each
wearing a Leaf headband on their fore heads. The first woman had
purple hair tied in a ponytail and blue eyes wearing a fishnet shirt
with a brown trench coat and a mini skirt with shin guards on her
knees and ninja sandals on her feet. The other woman had long wavy
black hair and crimson red eyes wearing a dress that look like it was
made out of bandages with a red sleeve on it and she was also wearing
ninja sandals on her feet.</P><P>"Alright are
you four the genin were suppose to train?" ask the first woman</P><P>"Yes we are
but who are the two of you?" replied Micheal</P><P>"I am Kurenai
and this woman next to me is my friend and fellow jonin Anko."
replied Kurenai</P><P>"Well in that
case you four better met us on the roof if you don't want to go back
to the academy." said Anko</P><P>With that they
both disappeared into a cloud of smoke.</P><P>"I guess we
better go to the roof if we don't want to make our new sensei's
angry." said Sakura</P><P>"Your probably
right Sakura. That Anko lady doesn't look like the type to wait for
anybody." said Itachi</P><P>"Yeah we
better hurry if we want to make a good first impression on them."
said Ino</P><P>With that the
four of them left the classroom and started to head to the roof.
After five minutes of walking they reach the roof and saw Kurenai and
Anko waiting for the four of them and Anko look annoyed.</P><P>"It about time
the four of you decide to show up here." said Anko annoyed</P><P>"Anko just cut
them some slack as they are new genin. Now you four should take a
seat and relax." said Kurenai</P><P>With that the
four of them took a seat on the floor of the roof.</P><P>"Alright since
we are all here how about the four of you tell us more about
yourselfs so we can get to know each other better." said Kurenai</P><P>"How about you
and Anko Sesnei tell us about yourself's first then we can each go
after the two of you." said Sakura</P><P>"Okay then I
will go first. My name is Anko and I like dango and hanging out with
my friend Kurenai here and I dislike ninja who think that they are
better then everybody else and I hate people who pick on people
weaker then them. And my goal is to make the four of you into the
best ninja I can." said Anko</P><P>"I guess it is
my turn. My name is Kuernai and I like dango as well and hanging out
with my friedn Anko and learning new Genjutsu. My dislikes are men
who are perverts and anyone who thinks they are the best ninja in the
world. And my goal is to make you four into the best squad in the
entire village. Now you four go." said Kurenai</P><P>"My name is
Sakura and my likes are hanging out with me two friends Ino and
Itachi and learing new jutsu as well. My dislike is other girls
thinking they are best looking girls in the village and not working
hard as ninja. And my goal is to get the attention of a certain boy
that I like." said Sakura looking at Micheal</P><P>"I guess it is
my turn. The names Itachi and my likes are hanging out with my
friends Ino and Sakura and training to be the best ninja of my clan.
My dislikes are people who are after power and wanting to hurt
innocent people. And my goal is to become leader of my clan one day
and get the attention of a boy I just meet not to long ago." said
Itachi blushing</P><P>"Well my name
is Ino and my likes are helping my mom in our flower shop and hanging
out with my two best friends Sakura and Itachi and I dislike people
being bullies to people weaker then they are and trying to tell
everyone they are the best thing in the world. And my goal is to
master my clan's jutsu and get the attention of the guy of my
dreams." said Ino blushing as well</P><P>"Now how about
you new guy. Tell us about yourself." said Anko looking at Micheal</P><P>"Well my name
is Micheal Knight and my likes are my friend and partner K.I.T.T. and
hanging with my girlfriend Kyuubi. I dislike people who seek to harm
other people for no reason and trying to destroy anyone who gets in
their way. My goal is more like something I have to get done as it
could mean the difference between life and death." said Micheal</P><P>"Well that
sounds very interesting. Now that we got everything covered . It is
time for me and Anko to gave you four the real Genin exam." said
Kurenai</P><P>"What do you
mean the real exam Kureanai Sensei? I thought the exam we did was the
real thing." ask Sakura confuse</P><P>"No that was
just the exam to see if you four were ready to take the real exam."
replied Anko</P><P>"So what is
the real exam we will have to take?" ask Itachi</P><P>"Well you four
will have to come to training ground 7 tomorrow and find out. And if
you all failed you will be all sent back to the academy for another
year." replied Kuernai</P><P>"And may I
suggest you four don't eat breakfast tomorrow before you come."
said Anko</P><P>"How come we
can't eat breakfast before the test Anko Sensei?" ask Ino confuse</P><P>"Because you
will failed and it will only slow the four of you down." replied
Anko</P><P>"So until
tomorrow go home and get some rest as you will all need it." said
Kurenai</P><P>With that
Kurenai and Anko got up and left in a breeze of leafs leaving the
four genin on the roof alone.</P><P>"I don't know
about the three of you. But I am going to get something to eat before
I head home and rest." said Micheal getting up</P><P>"Well I have
to get home before my mom gets worried about me. So I will see the
three of you tomorrow ." said Sakura</P><P>"I have to go
home to as my mom and father are probably what is taking me so long
getting home. So I will see the three of you in the morning." said
Itachi</P><P>"Well I would
like to go with you Micheal but I have to get home to and help my mom
with the flower shop before it is to late. So I will see you in the
moring Micheal." said Ino</P><P>With that the
three girls left Micheal and headed home. Once they were gone Micheal
jump off the roof and landed on the ground in front of the academy
and saw K.I.T.T. park in front of him looking like he was waiting for
Micheal to show up.</P><P>"K.I.T.T. what
are you doing here when you should be at the house with Kyuubi?"
ask Micheal</P><P>"Well Kyuubi
was wondering how you made out and sent me here to go pick you up and
bring you back to the house where she is waiting for you." replied
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Well I should
have guess Kyuubi would worried about me K.I.T.T. as she always does.
But since you are here how about we go to the Ichiraka Ramen Stand as
I could go for some Ramen as I have not had any in a long time."
said Micheal</P><P>With that
Micheal got inside K.I.T.T. and drove to Ichiraka Ramen. When they
got there Micheal got out of K.I.T.T. and went inside the stand and
took a seat inside and saw a woman with brown hair and black eyes
working in the front of the stand. The woman look up and saw Micheal
sitting in front of her.</P><P>"What can I
get for you today young man?" ask the woman</P><P>"How about
some of your famous BBQ pork Ramen Ayame." replied Micheal giving
her a fox smile</P><P>When Ayame saw
Micheal gave her that smile it reminded her of their best costumer
Naruto and something told her that this cute young guy was Naruto but
was wondering how he could look so different.</P><P>"Naruto is
that you?" ask Ayame blushing</P><P>"I guess I
can't fool you Ayame no matter how hard I try to hide my appearance."
replied Micheal</P><P>"Can you wait
right here while I go get my father to tell him you are here." said
Ayame</P><P>With that Ayame
went over to the stove where her father Teuchi was cooking Ramen and
told him to come over to the front of the stand to see something.
After a minute Ayame came back to the counter with her father who
look annoyed.</P><P>"Ayame why did
you have to drag me all the way to the counter to met some costumer
when I have Ramen to cook?" ask Teuchi annoyed</P><P>"Because our
favorite costumer has return to order some Ramen and I think you
should see who it is." replied Ayame</P><P>With that Teuchi
came to the counter and saw Micheal sitting there looking at him and
something told him he met this person some place before.</P><P>"Sorry about
my daughter here dragging me away from my work when she should be
taking your order." said Teuchi</P><P>"Don't worry
about Teuchi. I haven't seen you and her in five years." replied
Micheal smiling</P><P>When Micheal
smiled Teuchi realize who he was and had a look of shock on his face.</P><P>"Naruto is
that you.? How can you be alive when you were suppose to have died
five years ago?" ask Teuchi shock</P><P>"Well first
thing my name is Micheal Knight now and how come I am alive is a long
story that will be hard to believe." replied Micheal</P><P>"Well you can
tell us your story over a bowl of Ramen and it is on the house as I
am glad that you are just alive and well." said Teuchi</P><P>With that Teuchi
went over to the stove and made a bowl of Ramen and gave it to
Micheal and Micheal told Teuchi and Ayame the same story as he told
the Hokage about what happen over the past five years since he was
suppose to be dead. After Micheal finish his story Teuchi and Ayame
had a look of pure shock on their faces.</P><P>"So Micheal
where is this friend K.I.T.T. of yours?" ask Ayame</P><P>"He is right
outside the stand waiting for me to finish eating my Ramen."
replied Micheal pointing to K.I.T.T.</P><P>"You mean that
strange piece of black metal on wheels is your friend K.I.T.T. ?"
ask Teuchi in disbelief</P><P>"Yes it is."
replied Micheal</P><P>"Well he
doesn't look like much to me." said Teuchi</P><P>"Well for your
information. I can hear everything you just said about me." replied
K.I.T.T. annoyed</P><P>"Did I just
hear that piece of metal say he heard everything I just said about
it?" ask Teuchi starting to freak out</P><P>"Just I did
and I would like it if you stop calling me a piece of metal and call
me by my name." replied K.I.T.T. starting to get angry</P><P>"You have to
excuse my father for being rude to you K.I.T.T. it is just that we
have never met anything like you before in the village." said Ayame</P><P>"Then I will
take that as a apology then. As long as you just call me by name from
now on." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Well I better
get going as Kyuubi will be getting worried about me. So I will see
the two of you later." said Micheal</P><P>"Yeah we will
see you later Micheal and it was good to see you again after all
these years." said Ayame</P><P>"You are
always welcome to stop by anytime you feel like it as is K.I.T.T.
here." said Teuchi</P><P>With that
Micheal got out of his seat and got inside of K.I.T.T. and drove away
back towards his parents house. Once they reach the house K.I.T.T.
decide to speak up.</P><P>"You like this
Ayame girl don't Micheal as well as you three female teammates
Sakura,Itachi,and Ino?" ask K.I.T.T. curious</P><P>"No I don't
K.I.T.T.. Ayame is a old friend of mine and my three teammates are
just my teammates and maybe one day my friends." replied Micheal</P><P>"Well
according to my readings of your heart rate and blood pressure it
seems to me you like them more then just friends and they feel the
same way about you when they are near you as they gave off the same
readings that you did." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"You don't
know nothing about being in love K.I.T.T. and you better never tell
any of this to Kyuubi." said Micheal</P><P>"I don't have
to Micheal as something tells me she already knows about this."
replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Well then I
will handle her if she does. So I better go in and get some rest for
my test tomorrow and you are coming with me K.I.T.T. as I may need
your help passing it." said Micheal</P><P>"As you wish
Micheal. I will be ready to go with you by the morning." said
K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that
Micheal got out of K.I.T.T. and went inside the house. Once Micheal
got inside Kyuubi came out of nowhere and wrap her arms around
Micheal and saw that she had drop the transformation jutsu as her fox
ears and fox tails were now visible.</P><P>"Micheal-Kun.
I am glad you are back." said Kyuubi smiling</P><P>"I am glad I
am back to Kyuubi-Chan as I have miss you today and before you ask
everything went well with me teammates and my Sensei's." replied
Micheal giving Kyuubi a kiss on the lips</P><P>"That's is
good to hear. But before we go to bed we have something important to
discus about." said Kyuubi</P><P>"What is it we
need to discus?" ask Micheal confuse</P><P>"Well since
you have a bloodline now. You will need to have more then one wife to
insure it doesn't die out." said Kyuubi</P><P>"Kyuubi you
the only woman I need right now and besides where would I find these
other woman to marry?" ask Micheal</P><P>"How about
your three female teammates and that woman at the Ramen Stand Ayame
they all seem interested in you." replied Kyuubi</P><P>"How would you
know that Kyuubi? Did K.I.T.T. end up telling you what happen with
them when I told him to kept it a secret?" ask Micheal</P><P>"No he didn't
tell me. I found out on my own by watching you in a safe hiding place
where you couldn't see me and I think they will all make fine wife's
as they seem very nice and caring towards you. So at least think
about trying to ask any of them on a date." replied Kyuubi</P><P>"Fine I will
ask them when and if it is the right time Kyuubi. But right now we
need some rest as I have a exam to pass tomorrow and I need all my
strength to pass it." said Micheal</P><P>"Oh course
Micheal-Kun. It has been a long and tiring day so we should get some
rest for now." said Kyuubi</P><P>With that they
headed towards their bedroom to sleep for the night. The next morning
Sakura,Itachi,and Ino were waiting for Micheal and their Sensei's to
show up so they could all pass the exam.</P><P>"I wonder
where Micheal is?" ask Sakura</P><P>"I don't know
Sakura. But he should be here soon." replied Itachi</P><P>"Yeah he knows
how important this exam is to us and he will show up on time." said
Ino</P><P>As soon as Ino
said that they could see something coming towards them at a fast
speed in the distance and saw it was black. All of a sudden the thing
stop in front of them in a cloud of dust and when it cleared they saw
it was K.I.T.T. in front of them and the door open and Micheal step
out smiling.</P><P>"Sorry I am
late you three. But I had to make sure K.I.T.T. was all set for
helping us pass this exam." said Micheal</P><P>"That is all
okay Micheal. But who is this K.I.T.T. person?" ask Sakura confuse</P><P>"That would be
me in front of you." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Alright
please tell us that piece of black metal didn't just talk." said
Ino starting to freak out</P><P>"Well of
course K.I.T.T. talk Ino. Right K.I.T.T. ?" said Micheal</P><P>"That would be
correct Micheal." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"How can that
be possible that a piece of black metal can talk like a summon
creature?" ask Itachi confuse</P><P>"Because
K.I.T.T. is a special type of summon I found a scroll of." replied
Micheal quickly making up a lie</P><P>"I guess that
would explain that." said Sakura</P><P>"So where are
Anko and Kurenai Sensei?" ask Micheal</P><P>"We don't know
where they are Micheal. They should be here any minute now."
replied Itachi</P><P>When Itachi said
that there was a gust of wind and when it pass there in front of them
stood Anko and Kurenai holding a bell in each hand.</P><P>"Well it is
good to see you all showed up for the exam you four." said Kurenai</P><P>"Yeah this
will be a fun exam for you to take as it will be very hard." added
Anko</P><P>"Micheal is
this the Anko person that is suppose to be a crazy woman?" ask
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Who the hell
just said that about me?" demanded Anko</P><P>"That would be
me standing next to Micheal." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Alright I
must be going crazy. Because I could swear that piece of black metal
on wheels just said something to me." said Anko freaking out</P><P>"Your not
crazy Anko Sensei. K.I.T.T. here is a special type of summon Micheal
found in a scroll." replied Itachi</P><P>"Well that
kind of makes sense to me." said Kurenai</P><P>"So what kind
of test are you and Anko Sensei going to gave us?" ask Sakura</P><P>"Well the exam
is that the bells in me and Anko's hand you will have to take from us
if you want to pass the exam." said Kurenai</P><P>"But there are
only two bells Kuernai Sensei and four of us. So how do we all pass
the exam?" ask Ino</P><P>"Well only two
of you will pass the test as there are only two bells and the other
two will be sent back to the academy until next year." replied Anko</P><P>"So since you
know what the exam is about you will have until noon time to get the
bells from me and Anko starting now." said Kurenai</P><P>With that
Kurenai and Anko disappeared in a breeze of wind leaving the four
genin alone.</P><P>"What do we do
Itachi none of us can fail this exam but there are only two bells and
four of us?" ask Sakura</P><P>"Well if you
ask me. Everything about this exam is just a test to see if we work
as a team." replied Micheal</P><P>"What do you
mean by that?" ask Ino</P><P>"Think about
it. We were place on a team and there are only two bells for two of
us. So why do Kurenai and Anko want us all to go after them."
replied Micheal</P><P>"Your right
Micheal. This exam is to see if we work as a team and forget about
the fact that there are only two bells." said Itachi</P><P>"That is
correct Itachi and good thing I have a plan that will get us the
bells and we all pass this exam." said Micheal</P><P>"So what is
your plan Micheal?" ask Sakura curious</P><P>"Well all you
need to do is listen to me and let me and K.I.T.T. handle the tough
part of the plan." replied Micheal</P><P>With that
Micheal told the three girls his plan and what to do. Meanwhile up in
the trees t far away Anko and Kurenai were waiting to see what the
four genin would try first.</P><P>"So Anko do
you think these four have any chance of passing this test?" ask
Kurenai</P><P>"I don't think
so Kurenai. They will fail it just like all the other teams did."
replied Anko</P><P>All of a sudden
Anko and Kurenai look up and saw K.I.T.T. coming towards them at a
fast speed.</P><P>"Looks likes
Micheal wants to go off on his own and try to take the bells from us
using his summon there." said Kurenai</P><P>"Well it is to
bad it isn't going to work." said Anko</P><P>At that moment
Micheal who was inside K.I.T.T. was getting ready for the tough part
of their plan.</P><P>"Okay K.I.T.T.
do you have a lock on Anko and Kurenai?" ask Micheal</P><P>"Yes I do
Micheal they are hiding in the tree up ahead." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Alright then
K.I.T.T. transform into attack mode." said Micheal</P><P>With that
K.I.T.T.'s body change into a more powerful form with a spoiler on
the trunk and a engine coming out of the hood and the cobra on the
trunk change to a silver color and the grill change from black to
silver as well . Meanwhile Anko and Kurenai had seen what happen to
K.I.T.T. and decide to jump from the tree and prepare to throw a
barrage of kuni at K.I.T.T. to stop him from coming any further.
Micheal had seen Anko and Kurenai jump from the tree and was prepared
for it.</P><P>"Alright
K.I.T.T. time to use the turbo boost and use the new E.M.P. on Anko
and Kurenai so the others can finish our plan. Alright partner."
said Micheal</P><P>"You got it
Micheal." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>All of a sudden
Anko and Kurenai look in surprise as K.I.T.T. launch into the air and
headed towards them and before he went pass them they saw what look
like a wave of light come out from him and both them felt their
bodies feel like they were hit by lighting and they fell to the
ground and they couldn't move a muscle. At that moment Sakura,Ino,and
Itachi came out from the trees and took the bells from the two of
them.</P><P>"Looks like
Micheal's plan work." said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah we got
the bells from Anko and Kurenai Sensei like he and K.I.T.T. said we
would." replied Itachi smiling</P><P>"So did we
pass the test Anko and Kurenai Sensei?" ask Ino looking at the two
of them</P><P>"Yes you all
pass the test since you work as a team to take the bells from us."
replied Kurenai</P><P>"Yeah you all
did. But can any of you tell us why me and Kurenai here can't move
our bodies at all?" ask Anko</P><P>"That would be
because of K.I.T.T. 's E.M.P. That hit the both of you." replied
Micheal</P><P>"What the hell
is a E.M.P.?" ask Anko confuse</P><P>"It stands for
Electronic Magnetic Pulse and is usually use to stop anything that
has electronics in it. But I have adjusted it to work on humans as
well making them unable to move when they are hit by it as it messes
around with the nervous system leaving the person defenseless."
replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Don't worry
the effects should wear off any minute now as I only wanted to
paralyze the two of you long enough so Sakura,Itachi, and Ino could
grab the bells without the two of you putting up a fight." said 
Micheal</P><P>As Micheal said
that Anko and Kurenai could feel their bodies returning back to
normal and could move again and the both of them stood up on their
feet.</P><P>"All I can say
about this E.M.P. of K.I.T.T.'s is it looks like it could come in
handy stop any enemy ninja in their tracks as me and Anko could tell
you first hand." said Kurenai</P><P>"Yeah it is
something alright. But one word of warning don't ever use that thing
ever again on me and Kureani or we will make you and K.I.T.T. very
sorry you ever use it on us. Do you understand that Gaki?" said
Anko</P><P>"Oh course I
understand you very well Anko Sensei as does K.I.T.T. right partner."
replied Micheal looking at K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Yes we both
understand you Anko and you have my promise I will never use my
E.M.P. On you and Kurenai ever again as you are allies." added
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Good since
that is settled. I think it is time for our first mission as a team."
said Kureani</P><P>"What kind of
mission are we going to have Kurenai Sensei?" ask Sakura</P><P>"Well we will
have to go see the Hokage to get it first." said Kureani</P><P>"Well all I
can say is that it had better be a dangerous mission." said Anko
crossing her arms across her chest.</P><P>With that they
all headed towards the Hokage's tower to get their first mission as a
team. As they were walking K.I.T.T. decide to say something to
Micheal.</P><P>"Micheal may I
say something to you?" ask K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Yeah you can
say anything you want to me partner." replied Micheal</P><P>"Well from
looking at your team it looks like they could be very useful in
helping us find out where K.A.R.R. is if we can all work well as a
team." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"You could be
right about that K.I.T.T. . But we should see if they can be trusted
with knowing who I use to be and if they believe us about K.A.R.R.
and the danger he could be to the village and the world." replied
Micheal</P><P>"And who knows
they could be helpful in helping me and K.I.T.T. find out where
K.A.R.R. is before anything bad happens to innocent people if any
evil ninja find him." thought Micheal</P><P>With that they
continued on their way towards the Hokage tower to get their first
mission.</P><P>That's it for
this chapter. So what did you think of people's reaction towards
seeing K.I.T.T. and Micheal meeting his new team. The K.I.T.T. in
this story is from the new Knight Rider Series but I have something
coming up in a future chapter that will please the fans of the old
Knight Rider Series and I promise it will be very rewarding if you
stick with this story until then. As always please leave reviews and
comments as I want people's options on this story. Thanks and stay
tune for the next chapter</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Stranded Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto
or Knight Rider. Naruto is own by Masashi Kishimoto and Knight Rider
is own by NBC. I don't make money off this story. AN: There will be a
slight crossover with the T.V. Series Viper and it is own by NBC.</P><P>It now had been a few weeks since team
seven had pass the bell test and during that time they had completed
a few D rank mission and now they were on a another D rank mission
which was to catch the Fire Lord's wife's cat which was giving
Sakura,Itachi,and Ino a hard time trying to catch it. Sakura had
almost mange to catch the cat by cornering it next to a tree but the
cat mange to get away just as Sakura was about to grab it and she
fell to the ground on her face.</P><P>"Man I can't believe that a stupid
cat can gives us so much trouble trying to catch it." said Sakura
angry</P><P>"Yeah I know what you mean Sakura.
Everytime we get close to that cat to catch it it manges to get
away." said Ino angry</P><P>"Well we can't give up now you two we
have to catch that cat if we want to complete this mission." said
Itachi</P><P>"Your right Itachi we can't give up.
But any of you seen Micheal anywhere?" ask Sakura</P><P>"Well I haven't seen Micheal since
this mission started." replied Ino</P><P>"Well he is around here somewhere. I
just hope that cat doesn't give him a hard time trying to catch it."
said Itachi</P><P>"I wouldn't count on that Itachi."
said Micheal's voice</P><P>The three girls turn in the direction
of Micheal voice and saw him looking at the three of them wearing a
long sleeve gray shirt, blue jeans and black sneakers and in his arms
was the cat that had given them a hard time trying to catch it
purring with it's eyes close and looking peaceful.</P><P>"AH Micheal how did you end up
catching the cat without it running away?" ask Sakura suprise</P><P>"Well maybe because I am kind of a
cat person and didn't try cornering it and chasing it all around the
forest like a crazy person." replied Micheal smiling</P><P>"Well I guess it doesn't really
matter how you caught the cat Micheal. All that matters is that we
completed the mission in record time." said Itachi</P><P>"Yeah Itachi is right. So we better
head back to Anko and Kuernai Sensei and tell them that the mission
is over." said Ino</P><P>With that they head toward where
Kurenai and Anko were waiting for them. When they got there they saw
Kurenai and Anko were lending against a tree and Anko look very
unhappy and Kurenai notice the cat in Micheal's arms and smiled.</P><P>"While it looks like you four
completed the mission." said Kurenai looking at the four Genin</P><P>"Well to tell the truth Kurenai
Sensei. Micheal here was the one who caught the cat without no
problem." replied Sakura</P><P>"Yeah Micheal made it look easy the
cat didn't put up any fight when Micheal caught it." added Itachi</P><P>"So what do we do now Kurenai Sensei
since the mission is over?" ask Ino curious</P><P>"Well first thing is we bring the cat
over to the Hokage's tower and then we will receive our next mission
from him." replied Kurenai</P><P>"Well it better not be another D rank
mission because I am getting sick of them." said Anko pouting</P><P>With that they headed towards the
Hokage's tower to get their next mission. When they got there and
reach the Hokage's office they Micheal handed the cat over to the
Fire Lord's wife who hug it tightly. She then paid the Hokage and
left. The Hokage then turn to team 7.</P><P>"Alright since you completed your
mission your next D rank mission will be." started Sarutobi</P><P>"Enough of these stupid D rank
mission Lord Hokage." yelled Anko</P><P>"Anko mind your manners in front of
the Hokage." said Kurenai</P><P>"Well I am sorry Kurenai. But I had
enough of these D rank missions and I think it is about time we get a
real mission that is challenging." replied Anko</P><P>"I hate to admit Kurenai Sensei. Anko
Sensei has a point we have done nothing but mission a regular person
can do." said Sakura</P><P>"Well there is a reason you have been
given D rank missions so far Sakura." said Sarutobi</P><P>"What reason Lord Hokage?" ask
Itachi confuse</P><P>"Well you see you four you are new
genin just out of the academy and we all need to learn to work as a
team which is why we are given D rank missions so we build teamwork
before we get any higher ranking missions." replied Kuernai</P><P>"I guess that kind of makes sense
Kurenai Sensei." said Ino</P><P>"Well since that is settled. I was
going to give you all a D rank mission but since Anko is getting
restless how about a C rank mission that is if both your Sensei's
think you are all ready for a higher rank mission." said Sarutobi</P><P>"Well I think our team is ready for a
C rank mission Lord Hokage as it could tell me and Anko how well the
four of them work well together as a team." said Kurenai</P><P>"Well I agree to I think they are
ready for a challenge besides It will give me a change of pace from
doing all these stupid D rank mission." added Anko</P><P>"Well I have a C rank mission right
here which is a escort mission to protect a caravan of traveling
merchants to a village in the Land of birds. You will meet them
outside the gates to the village with in an hour." said Sarutobi</P><P>"Ah if I may Lord Hokage. I would
like to bring K.I.T.T. along with us on this mission." said Micheal</P><P>"Why would you want to bring along
K.I.T.T. since this is just a C rank mission and we can take care of
anything that we run into?" ask Anko angry</P><P>"Because me and K.I.T.T. are partners
and I have a feeling we may need him on this mission and also I have
my own personal reasons why I want K.I.T.T. along on this mission."
replied Micheal</P><P>"What kind of personal reasons?"
ask Sakura curious</P><P>"That is between me and the Hokage
and he knows why it is important K.I.T.T. comes along on this
mission." replied Micheal</P><P>"Micheal's right Sakura. His reasons
for wanting K.I.T.T. along on this mission are important and are a
secret between me and him. So if there isn't anything else to say
just go home and get what you need for this mission and meet outside
the gates of the village with in an hour to meet the caravan you will
be escorting on this mission." said Sarutobi</P><P>With that they all left the tower and
went to their homes to get prepared for the mission. When Micheal got
to his house and went inside he saw Kyuubi sitting with Ayame at the
table looking like they were waiting for him to come back from his
mission.</P><P>"Kyuubi why is Ayame here with you in
the house?" ask Micheal confuse</P><P>"Because Ayame stop by to say hello
and wanted to see you to tell you something important." replied
Kyuubi</P><P>"What is it that she has to tell me
?" ask Micheal confuse</P><P>"Well this is hard for me to say to
you Micheal. But I will cut to the chase. I came here to tell you
that I have had a crush on you ever since I met you and wanted to
tell you for the longest time." replied Ayame</P><P>"You mean to tell me you have had a
crush on me ever since we met?" ask Micheal shock</P><P>"Yes and me and Kyuubi already talk
about this when I came over here and she told me more about your
bloodline trait and how you needed more then one wife in order to
keep it from dying out and we both agreed to share you if you want
want us to." replied Ayame</P><P>"All I can say is that I am very
faltered that a beautiful woman like you is interested in me. But I
need time to think this over. But I will let you know what my
decision is when I get back from my mission." said Micheal</P><P>"That is all I ask of you Micheal."
said Ayame</P><P>"So what kind of mission do you have
this time Micheal-Kun?" ask Kyuubi</P><P>"Well it a C rank mission which is to
escort a caravan of merchants to a village in the Land of Birds.
Which is why I came here in the first place to get my weapons and
bring K.I.T.T. which me as I could get some information as to where
K.A.R.R. could be hidden so we can go after him and destroy him once
and for all." replied Micheal</P><P>"Well in that case good luck and I
hope you can find some information on K.A.R.R. while you are on this
mission." said Kyuubi</P><P>"Thanks because I think I will need
it on this mission." said Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal told Kyuubi and Ayame
he would see them later and then he gather his weapons together and
got inside K.I.T.T. and headed towards the gates of the village.
Meanwhile outside the gates of the village the others were waiting
with the caravan of merchants waiting for Micheal and K.I.T.T. to
show up.</P><P>"Can any of you ninja tell us why we
are waiting for the last member of your team when we need to get
going as we don't want to be late getting to our next stop?" ask a
man</P><P>"Micheal will be here any minute as
he knows how important this mission is to everyone." replied
Kurenai</P><P>As soon as Kurenai said that they saw
K.I.T.T. coming towards them at a fast speed and stop right in front
of Kurenai and Micheal got out with sunglasses covering his eyes.</P><P>"Sorry me and K.I.T.T. are late
getting here but we had to be careful not hitting anyone on our way
here." said Micheal</P><P>"That's okay Micheal. We are just
glad you and K.I.T.T. could make it in time for the mission." said
Sakura</P><P>"Well it's about time you showed up
when we have been waiting all day for you ninja to escort us to the
Land of Birds." said another man</P><P>"Well don't blame Micheal for being
late as he had to come get me for this mission as it would appeared
you need my assistance." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Alright please tell me that piece of
metal didn't just say something?" ask the first man freaking out
from hearing K.I.T.T. talk</P><P>"Well of course K.I.T.T. talk. He is
a special summon that Micheal found a scroll of and he could prove
useful to us on this mission." replied Anko trying to hide the
smile on her face from seeing the man's reaction to K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Well since we are done talking. I
think we should be heading out since we have a long journey ahead of
us." said Kurenai</P><P>With that everyone headed out towards
the Land of Birds. As they started walking Micheal had bad feeling
about the woman with long purple hair in the caravan as he felt she
look very familiar somehow but quickly put aside as something to do
with escorting the caravan to the Land of Birds and continued walking
with K.I.T.T. traveling along side on him at a slow speed to keep a
eye out for trouble. After a few days of traveling and resting the
bad feeling that Micheal had didn't go away and it bug him to no end
as it kept on telling him this mission was of a higher rank then they
had been assign and Micheal could swear he met the woman in the
caravan that was in front of him somewhere before and decide to find
out who exactly she was.</P><P>"K.I.T.T. I want you to do something
for me." said Micheal looking at K.I.T.T.</P><P>"What is it you need me to do for you
Micheal?" ask K.I.T.T.</P><P>"See the woman in front of us with
long purple hair. I want you to scan her face and run it through the
database of everyone living in the Elemental Countries and tell me
who she is when you find a match as I can swear I know her from
somewhere before and I have a very bad feeling this mission is more
then what it appears partner." replied Micheal</P><P>"I will do it at once Micheal. But it
will take me a minute to find a match in the database as there are
countless people in the Elemental Countries." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that K.I.T.T. use his scanners to
scan the woman face and started to cross match it to everyone in the
Knight Industries Database looking for a match. After five minutes of
searching K.I.T.T. had finally found a match and decide to tell
Micheal at once.</P><P>"Micheal I have found a match in the
Database and you are right thinking this mission is more then it
appears." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"So who is she K.I.T.T.?" ask
Micheal curious</P><P>"She is none other Princess Toki
future Feudal Lord of the Land of Birds and from the files it appears
that there are a number of missing ninja out to kill her so they can
take over the Land of Birds for their own gain. Which is probably why
she is traveling with this caravan as a disguise to protect her from
these missing ninja and we were trick into this mission thinking it
was C rank when it should be B or A rank since she is here traveling
with them. But I am afraid that this trick isn't fooling the missing
ninja as my scanners are picking up what appears to be about 10 to 12
ninja probably Chunin Rank . Which means everyone here is in danger."
replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Then we better go warn the others of
what we found out then before something bad happens." said Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal went over to Kurenai
who was not to far ahead of him and K.I.T.T. and decide to tell her
what he and K.I.T.T.T found out.</P><P>"Kurenai Sensei I have something
important to tell you." said Micheal trying to get her attention</P><P>"What is it Micheal that you need to
tell me?'" ask Kurenai curious</P><P>"We need to get everyone to safety as
this mission shouldn't even be a C rank mission but a B or A rank
mission as we have been deceive." replied Micheal</P><P>"What do you mean we been deceive?"
ask Kuernai getting confuse</P><P>"Well maybe you should ask the woman
behind me what is really going on. Isn't that right Princess Toki and
don't even think about lying as I had K.I.T.T. run your face through
the database and bring up your file." replied Micheal looking at
Toki</P><P>"Is this true are you Princess Toki?"
ask Sakura</P><P>"Yes I am and the real reason you are
on this mission is to protect me from the missing ninja who are out
to kill me and take over my land." replied Toki</P><P>"Well for your information we were
given this mission to protect these merchants on their way to the
Land of Birds and you should have told us the truth as you could have
had better ninja to protect you to." said Anko</P><P>"Well I think that doesn't matter
right now Anko Sensei." said Micheal</P><P>"What do you mean?" ask Itachi</P><P>"While according to K.I.T.T. the
missing ninja that are after Princess Toki here are not far away and
are heading towards us right now." replied Micheal</P><P>"So what do we do now?" ask Ino
scared</P><P>"All we can do is protect these
merchants from the missing ninja as that is our mission we were
given." replied Kuernai</P><P>"What about protecting me since I am
the one you should be protecting the most?" ask Toki</P><P>"Well you should have told us the
truth from the start as now you put all these innocent people in
danger. But you have our word we will try to protect you as well
Princess Toki." replied Anko</P><P>"Alright everyone get into defense
positions and protect everyone from the missing ninja whenever they
decide to appear." ordered Kurenai</P><P>With that everyone get into their
defense positions and prepared to protect everyone from harm. All of
a sudden from the tree tops a barrage of Kuni Knives started to head
towards everyone at a fast speed. When just before they hit them they
bounce off what look like a invisible shield of some kind and
everyone but Micheal was wondering what it had come from.</P><P>"Okay can anyone tell me what just
happen?" ask Kuernai</P><P>"That would be my forcefield that I
expanded to protect everyone from those Kuni." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Well thanks for the help K.I.T.T.
.But where are the ninja that threw those Kuni at?" ask Anko</P><P>As soon as Anko said that they were
surrounded by 12 ninja each with a kuni arm in their hands and
standing in front of them was who appeared to be the leader of the
missing ninja. The leader was man with short silver hair and black
eyes with a leaf headband with a slash through it and he was smiling.</P><P>"Well Well what do we have are some
ninja from the Leaf village trying to protect princess Toki. And do
my eyes deceive me. It appears that Micheal Knight and his partner
K.I.T.T. are here as well. So how have things been for you since we
last met?" said the leader looking at Micheal smiling</P><P>"Things how being going great for me
Mizuki. How about you it appears you recovered from our last
encounter." replied Micheal</P><P>"Yes I have. But I haven't forgotten
how you almost ruin my career as ninja by breaking both my arms. I
was only here to kill Princess Toki but having you here is even
better as I can pay you back for what you did to me and once I kill
you then I turn your partner K.I.T.T. into scrap metal." said
Mizuki smiling</P><P>"That isn't going to happen Mizuki
because I am going to make sure I finish the job this time and you
can count on that." said Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal turn to his
teammates.</P><P>"I want you guys to deal with the
missing ninja while I go after Mizuki." said Micheal</P><P>"You got to be crazy Micheal that guy
is probably at the Jonin level there is no way you can defeat him
alone." said Sakura concern</P><P>"I know what I am doing Sakura as I
face Mizuki before and beat him good." replied Micheal</P><P>"Micheal right Sakura. It seems he
and Mizuki have some history together and it appears Micheal knows
how to beat him no problem." said Kurenai</P><P>"Kurenai's right. Besides we need to
handle the other ninja before anyone here gets hurt." added Anko</P><P>"So don't worry about me as I handled
worse people then Mizuki before and I have anyways come out on top. "
said Micheal smiling</P><P>"Well then you better just be careful
then and come back in one piece Micheal." said Itachi</P><P>"I promise I will Itachi and K.I.T.T.
here will protect everybody else with his forcefield. Right partner?"
said Micheal looking at K.I.T.T.</P><P>"You can count on me Micheal."
replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that Micheal took after Mizuki
while the others went to deal with the other ninja . Micheal took out
a kuni out of his pouch and threw it at Mizuki who deflected with his
own Kuni. Micheal then made a of handsigns and made about ten shadow
clones and attack Mizuki head on. Muzuki quickly reacted by making a
series of quick handsigns and let out a trail of fire that came out
of his mouth and hit all of Micheal's shadow clones and himself. When
the smoke cleared Micheal was on his knees trying to catch his breath
and look tired.</P><P>"What the matter Micheal? You losing
your touch because I thought you were going to kill me?" ask Mizuki
laughing</P><P>"This isn't over yet Mizuki. Because
I have one more jutsu up my sleeve." replied Naruto smilling</P><P>All of a sudden a sphere of blue chakra
appeared in his hand and Micheal run towards Mizuki who look up in
surprise as the sphere of blue chakra hit him in the chest and sent
him flying into a tree hard. Meanwhile Kuernai who had mange to make
some of the ninja retreat saw what Micheal had use against Mizuki and
was surprise at what happen.</P><P>"I don't believe this that jutsu that
Micheal just use on Mizuki that was the Fourth Hokage's jutsu the
Rasengan. But where did he learn a powerful jutsu like that from."
thought Kurenai shock</P><P>Meanwhile Micheal look towards where he
sent Mizuki into the tree and when the smoke cleared he saw that
Mizuki had disappeared and look like he had retreated.</P><P>"I don't believe this. Mizuki got
away again. But he probably didn't get very far. I better go see how
the others made out and then me and K.I.T.T. can go after Mizuki and
his ninja and finish them off once and for all so they can't harm
anyone else." thought Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal went back to the
others to see how they made out. When he got there he saw everyone
was all okay and it appeared the other ninja had gotten away as well.</P><P>"Is everyone alright?" ask Micheal
concern</P><P>"Yeah everyone is alright and it
appears we drove those ninja away." replied Kurenai</P><P>"Well than me and K.I.T.T. are going
to go after them before they have a chance to regroup." said
Micheal</P><P>"You got to be crazy Micheal. We need
to get these people to safety." said Itachi</P><P>"I know but I know Mizuki and he will
not give up until Princess Toki here is dead and as long as him and
his ninja are alive we are still in danger from attack." replied
Micheal</P><P>"Then if you are going after them
then you need backup." said Ino</P><P>"No thanks Ino. Me and K.I.T.T. can
handle this ourselves and this is something me and him have to do
alone." replied Micheal</P><P>"Well then you better hurry up before
they get to far away and you better be careful when you go after
them." said Anko</P><P>"Don't worry about me Anko me and
K.I.T.T. will be just fine and we will be back before you know it."
said Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal got inside of
K.I.T.T. and they headed off in the direction Mizuki and his ninja
took off in.</P><P>"Alright K.I.T.T. do you have a lock
on Mizuki and his ninja?" ask Micheal</P><P>"Yes I do Micheal. They are about
five miles away from are position." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Good then change into attack mode
and we can catch up to them faster." said Micheal</P><P>With that K.I.T.T. change into attack
mode and race towards where Mizuki and his ninja were. When they got
there Micheal look in horror as in front of him and K.I.T.T. were the
bodies of Mizuki ninja everywhere and it look like there had been a
explosion as there was the burnt remains of trees and there were burn
marks on the ground.</P><P>"K.I.T.T. what the hell just happen
here?" ask Micheal shock at the scene in front of him</P><P>"I don't know Micheal but from my
scans it appears they were hit by a few missiles that are identical
to my own." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"But how can that be possible?" ask
Micheal afraid of knowing who was the one responsible for the chaos
in front of him</P><P>"I don't know the answer to that
Micheal. But my scanners are picking up a weak lifesign about twenty
feet in front of us." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that Micheal got out of K.I.T.T.
and headed in the direction of where K.I.T.T. detected the lifesign
in front of them. When Micheal reach the area he saw Mizuki burnt and
barely alive on the ground in front of him.</P><P>"Mizuki who the hell did this to
you?" ask Micheal</P><P>"It was you partner K.I.T.T. who did
this to my men." replied Mizuki</P><P>"That is impossible. Me and K.I.T.T.
just got here." said Micheal</P><P>"Well I am telling you the truth your
partner was the one who did this as I could never mistake that piece
of scrap metal for anything else. The only difference was the lights
on the front were yellow instead of red. He probably thought it would
hide who he was. But it didn't work as I could tell right away it was
him all along. But I guess that doesn't matter now as my men are dead
and I am about to join them." replied Mizuki</P><P>All of a sudden Mizuki fell to the
ground with now lifeless eyes. Micheal then went back over to
K.I.T.T. and get inside.</P><P>"K.I.T.T. contact Madara and tell him
we have a code one emergency." said Micheal</P><P>"At once Micheal." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that K.I.T.T. open a line to
Knight Industries and Madara appeared on the screen.</P><P>"What do you want Micheal?" ask
Madara</P><P>"Well we have a big problem Madara."
replied Micheal</P><P>"What kind of problem are we talking
about?" ask Madara</P><P>"Well it appears that K.A.R.R. has
been found by someone as he just killed Mizuki and his ninja."
replied Micheal</P><P>"Are you sure about this Micheal?'"
ask Madara shock</P><P>"Yes I am very sure as Mizuki saw
K.A.R.R. with his own eyes before he died in front of me." replied
Micheal</P><P>"This is not good news then. I will
have Kabuto and Tayuya find out who found K.A.R.R. and set him loose
at once. Until then go on with your mission and report anything new
that has to do with K.A.R.R. at once." said Madara</P><P>"Understood Madara. Micheal out."
said Micheal turning off the communication line</P><P>"Alright K.I.T.T. lets head back to
the others and continue on with this mission and don't mention to
anybody about K.A.R.R. alright." said Micheal</P><P>"Understood Micheal." replied
K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that they headed back towards the
others. Once they met up with the others. Micheal and K.I.T.T. lied
to them saying that Mizuki and his ninja had been killed by one of
K.I.T.T.'s missiles. With that they continued on their way towards
the Land of Birds and finally reach it the next day. Once they got
there and the Merchants and Princess Toki were safe Team seven stood
in front of Toki.</P><P>"Thanks to you all my kingdom is safe
from those missing ninja." said Toki</P><P>"Don't mention it Princess it was our
honor to protect you and these merchants." said Kurenai</P><P>"Yeah but next time don't put
innocent people in danger like you did." said Anko</P><P>"You have my promise that I will
never do anything like that again." said Toki</P><P>"Well we better get going back to the
village as my mom is worried about me." said Sakura</P><P>"I know what you mean my parents must
be worried sick about me as well." said Itachi</P><P>"Well I for one am looking forward to
working at my mom's flower shop when I get back." said Ino</P><P>"I have to agree we will deserve a
long rest after this mission like K.I.T.T.?" said Micheal looking
at K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Yes you all deserve a long rest from
this mission." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that they all said a final goodbye
to Princess Toki and headed back towards the village. Unknow to all
of them watching them from a hilltop out of view was a identical car
of K.I.T.T. only the lights on the front were yellow instead of red.
This car was in fact K.A.R.R. who had followed all of them to the
Land of Birds and was looking down at K.I.T.T. and Micheal.</P><P>"Enjoy your rest well you can my
brother. Because soon I will destroy you and your partner the new
Micheal Knight and then there will be no one to stop me from taking
over this world and killing anyone who stands in my way." said
K.A.R.R. in a angry tone</P><P>Meanwhile far away underground inside a
huge metal room stood a red dodge viper with red lights flashing on
the front of it and standing not far away in a chair at a computer
screen was a woman with long brown hair and brown eyes wearing a
black shirt and blue jeans and white sneakers and staring at the
screen as K.A.R.R. had appear on it looking down at Micheal and
K.I.T.T. and the others.</P><P>"This is very bad. K.A.R.R. has been
reactivated by that evil ninja Orochimaru." said the Viper in a
robotic voice</P><P>"I know what you mean this is very
bad news. Which is why me and you have to go the Village Hidden in
the Leafs at once as Micheal and K.I.T.T. could use our help as you
know K.A.R.R. better then anyone else since you and the original
Micheal Knight defeated him all those years ago when you use to be in
your old black Trans Ams firebird body that my father Charles Graimen
built for you when he built you and K.A.R.R. back when he built the
two of you. But when it was decided you were to be dismantle and
shut down for good my father decide to put you into the body of the
Viper Defender that he help Julian Wilkes build and shut you down
until the day K.A.R.R. was reactivated and you would be needed if
K.I.T.T. need your help against him." said the woman</P><P>"I know this very well and you were
put into statis to save your life from cancer and you would be
reawaken to help me when K.I.T.T. need us to defeat K.A.R.R." said
the Viper</P><P>"I know that very well and thanks to
that I lose my husband Micheal and our son. But something about this
new Micheal Knight reminds me of him and my son and I can feel a
contaction to him like he is related to me somehow. But that doesn't
matter right now. How long will it take us to get to the village from
here?" ask the woman</P><P>"According to my scanners it will
take us about three and a half weeks to get from where we are to the
Village Hidden in the Leafs counting the time you need to rest up
since you need to eat and sleep." replied the Viper</P><P>"Well then we better get going before
K.A.R.R. decides to go after K.I.T.T. and Micheal and kills them."
said the woman</P><P>With that the woman get inside the
Viper and they drove out of the room and headed towards the village
as fast as possible hoping to get there before K.A.R.R. did and help
K.I.T.T. and Micheal defeat him.</P><P>That's it for this chapter. So what do
you think about the appearance of K.A.R.R. in this chapter. And there
will be a reaward for the first person who correctly guesses who the
Dodge Viper is as it shouldn't be a hard guess if you watch the

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>Stranded Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto
or Knight Rider. Naruto is own by Masashi Kishimoto and Knight Rider
is own by NBC. I don't make money off this story.</P><P>It now had been a little over three
weeks since the mission to the Land of Birds and they got back to the
village. During that time Sakura,Itachi, and Ino notice Micheal was
acting differently like something was on his mind and it was
troubling him to no end like it was making him worried about
something . The three girls tried several times to ask him what was
going on but everytime they ask him what was wrong Michael just said
it was nothing and not to worried about it. They even tried asking
K.I.T.T. what was wrong with Micheall and all he said was Micheal had
a lot on his mind and he would tell the three of them when he felt it
was right. Now the three of them and Micheal were going to met
Kurenai and Anko as they had something important to discus with the
four of them. As they were walking Sakura notice that Micheal was
still acting the same way he had been ever since their C rank mission
and decide to ask Micheal what was bothering him one more time.</P><P>"Micheal can I ask you a question?"
ask Sakura concern</P><P>"Sure you can ask me anything
Sakura." replied Micheal</P><P>"Well me and the others have notice
you are acting kind of strange like you have something important on
your mind ever since we got back from the Land of Birds and want to
know what is on your mind?" ask Sakura</P><P>"It is nothing that concerns the
three of you and I feel it should stay that way." replied Micheal
in a low tone</P><P>"What's so important that you have to
keep what's on your mind a secret Micheal?" ask Itachi</P><P>"Yeah were your teammates and friends
and you can tell us anything. So why are you keeping what's on your
mind a secret from us?" ask Ino</P><P>"If you three must know it is really
nothing that concerns the three of you and I would like to keep it
that way. So can we please just drop the subject." replied Micheal
in a angry tone</P><P>"Fine have it your way Micheal. But
we just want to let you know if you ever feel like talking about it
me,Itachi, and Ino are here for you any time." said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah were your friends Micheal and
nothing you do will change that." said Itachi</P><P>"Thanks and I promise when the time
is right I will tell you three what is on my mind." said Micheal
calming down</P><P>"That is all we ask for Micheal."
said Ino</P><P>With that they continued walking with
Micheal walking behind the three girls and looking at the three of
them.</P><P>"I wish I could tell the three of
them the truth about who I am and about K.A.R.R.. But I can't as I
care to much for the three of them like I do Kyuubi and Ayame to tell
them the truth as K.A.R.R. could harm the three of them if they find
out the truth as it would put them in danger and of course the
village as well." thought Micheal sadly</P><P>All of a sudden the four of them could
hear what sounded like yelling coming from a ally and it sounded like
someone was in trouble. Micheal decide to find out was going on in
the ally and ran towards the ally with Sakura,Itachi,and Ino running
after him. When Micheal got to where he heard the yelling he saw a
boy and a girl about 14 years old. The boy had face paint on his face
and wearing all black cloths carrying something on his back and the
girl next to him had dirty blond hair tied in four pigtails wearing
some type of Kimono with a large fan on her back and both of them
were wearing the Hidden Sand Village headband and Micheal saw the
Hokage's grandson Konohamaru being held by the collar of his shirt by
the boy with face paint yelling to Konohamaru and Micheal could make
out what they were saying.</P><P>"I am going to teach you a thing punk
about bumping into people." said the boy in a angry tone</P><P>"Kankuro I think the kid gets the
points. So just let him go and lets be on our way." said the girl</P><P>"I don't think so Temari. Because I
am going to make a example out of him so other kids will know what to
mess with me." replied Kankuro.</P><P>"I think you should just listen to
the girl and drop the boy right now." said Micheal coming out of
his hiding place</P><P>"Why should I do that?" ask Kankuro</P><P>"Because he is the Hokage's
grandson." replied Sakura</P><P>"Yeah you could be in a lot of
trouble if you don't drop him this second." said Itachi</P><P>"I don't think so because I think
this kid should know who he is messing with and I don't care if he is
the Hokage's grandson I am going to teach him a lesson for bumping
into me." said Kankuro</P><P>Before Kankuro could even lay a finger
on Konohamaru he was hit by what look like a beam of red light that
hit his hand and made him let go of Kononhamaru who quickly decide to
get out of the area as fast as he could.</P><P>"Who the hell did that?" demanded
Kankuro holding his hand which was in a lot of pain.</P><P>"That would be me that hit you with
my laser on stun." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>Kankuro look in the direction of the
voice and saw K.I.T.T. behind Micheal and the others with his red
light flashing back and forth.</P><P>"Okay please tell me that piece of
black metal didn't just talk to me." said Kankuro starting to freak
out</P><P>"Well I think it just did talk to you
Kankuro as I heard it to." said Temari freaking out as well</P><P>"You would be right you two that
K.I.T.T. here talk as he is a special summon that I found a scroll
of. But I wouldn't worry to much about K.I.T.T. doing any harm to you
as he only use his weapons on people who seek to harm innocent people
and he decide that you didn't mean to cause any harm to Konohamaru as
you just wanted to scare him." replied Micheal smiling</P><P>"That I did Micheal. But if you
decide to harm anyone else in this village then I will use lethal
force if I must to protect the innocent people of this village."
said K.I.T.T. in a threating tone</P><P>"We understand you loud and clear."
said Temari</P><P>"Yeah we will not try harming anyone
else in the village. You have our word." adding Kankuro nervous</P><P>"Well since that's settled. Care to
tell us why you two are in the village in the first place?" ask
Micheal</P><P>"Were here to take part in the Chunin
Exams." replied Temari</P><P>"That's right this year there being
held the village." said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah and we better hurry as we
didn't want to keep our Sensei waiting on us." said Kankuro</P><P>"Yeah our Sensei gets angry if we are
late. So we have to go but maybe we will meet you later around the
village." said Temari</P><P>With that they ran off leaving Micheal
and the others alone.</P><P>"Well that sure went well." said
Itachi</P><P>"Yeah and it is a good thing K.I.T.T.
here showed up when he did because I don't think we could have
handle those two by ourselves." said Ino</P><P>"Well I think we could have right
K.I.T.T." said Micheal looking at K.I.T.T.</P><P>"You are right Micheal as you four
work well together as a team." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Well we better get going if we don't
want to be late meeting Kurenai and Anko Sensei."said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah I know Anko Sensei will be
angry if we are late." said Itachi</P><P>"Well you four go on ahead as I have
to go back to Micheal house so Kyuubi as someone to keep her
company." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that the four of them headed
towards where they were suppose to meet Kurenai and Anko while
K.I.T.T. headed back towards the house. After a few more minutes of
walking they finally got to the meeting place and saw Kurenai and
Anko waiting for them and Anko didn't look to happy.</P><P>"Well it is about time you four
finally decided to show up." said Anko annoyed</P><P>"Well were sorry we are late Anko
Sensei. But we kind of ran into some trouble on the way getting
here." said Sakura</P><P>"Well that doesn't matter right now
as me and Anko have something important to tell the four of you."
said Kurenai</P><P>"What is it you have to tell us
Kurenai Sensei?" ask Itachi curious</P><P>"Well you see me and Kurenai have
enter you four into the Chunin exams this year." replied Anko</P><P>"But why us since we are just new
genin?" ask Ino surprise</P><P>"Because you four have proven you can
work well together as a team and have what it takes to take part in
the Chunin exams." replied Kurenai</P><P>"Well I fell honor that you two have
chosen us to enter the Chuni exams." said Micheal</P><P>"Well that is good to hear from you
Micheal. Here are your registration forms. Filled them out and bring
them to the room listed on them tomorrow morning." said Anko given
the four of them a form</P><P>"And don't worry to much about the
exams as me and Anko know you have what it takes to pass them."
said Kurenai</P><P>With that the two of them vanish in
breeze of leaves leaving the four genin alone.</P><P>"I don't know about the three of you
but I have to get home before my mom worries where I am." said Ino</P><P>"Yeah I have the feeling that my
parents are worried as well about me. So I will see the three of you
in the morning." said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah I have to get going to as my
father promise to teach me a new jutsu when I got home. So I will see
you in the morning as well Micheal." said Itachi</P><P>With that three girls headed towards
there homes leaving Micheal alone by himself. Micheal decide to take
a walk in the forest by himself to clear his head and to think about
what K.A.R.R. had plan. As he was walking Micheal had a feeling he
was being watch from somewhere and decided to keep a lookout for
trouble. All of a sudden a barrage of Kuni came from out of the trees
and headed towards him. Micheal quickly duck out of the way and look
up to see if threw the Kuni at him. When he look up Micheal saw a
ninja in front of him wearing a cloak and a straw hat with a strange
headband on his head and a kuni in his hand.</P><P>"What do you want?" demanded
Micheal</P><P>"All I want is to kill you since I am
in the Chunin Exams and decided to take out the compilation."
replied the ninja</P><P>"Well I hate to break it to you. But
you just mess with the wrong ninja today." said Micheal</P><P>"I think you are wrong and I will
prove it by killing you right now." said the ninja</P><P>With that the ninja charge at Micheal
with the intent to kill him. The ninja went to strike Micheal with
his Kuni when all of a sudden he look in shock as Micheal block it
with his arm that had turn into a sword and sent the ninja flying
backwards a couple of feet.</P><P>"How is it possible you can turn your
arm into a sword?" ask the ninja nervous</P><P>"Because it is part of my bloodline
trait as this next attack is to." replied Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal's arm turn back to
normal and to the ninja surprise a big spear made out of ice came
from Micheal's arm and headed straight towards him. The ninja barely
avoided the attack and saw Micheal coming towards him with a Rasengan
and Chidori in each hand with the intent to kill on Micheal's face.
Before the ninja knew what hit him he was struck by both attacks and
there was a big cloud of dust. When the dust cleared Micheal look at
the carter he made in the ground and saw instead of the ninja's body
there was only a wooden log in his place.</P><P>"I don't believe this. He got away
using a replacement jutsu to avoid my attacks. Well I hope he learn
his lesson not to mess with me and I hope for his sake I don't meet
him again as I plan to kill him the next time we meet." thought
Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal headed home. Later
that night Kurenai and Anko were waiting on a roof of a building
waiting for someone to show up. All of a sudden the ninja that attack
ninja appeared on the roof behind the two of them bowing.</P><P>"So Iruka did they all pass your
test?" ask Kurenai to the ninja</P><P>"Yes they did Kurenai. But Micheal
had me worried as if I didn't use that replacement jutsu I would have
been dead from his attack. And you were right about him knowing the
Rasengan but he also use Kakashi Chidori.." replied Iruka dropping
the transformation jutsu</P><P>"Well what do you expect Iruka you
did attack him and he only defended himself think you were a enemy
ninja. But what you just told us is making me wonder where Micheal
learn such powerful jutsu from. As I know that Kakashi only taught
Sasuke that jutsu and to no one else." said Anko</P><P>"Well that doesn't matter now Anko.
All that matters is that they all pass the test and are ready for the
Chunin Exams tomorrow." said Kurenai looking at the full moon.</P><P>The next morning Micheal and the rest
of team 7 had reach the building where the Chunin Exams were to be
held and now were starting head towards the room that was the from
when all of a sudded they were stop by boy their age with a bowl
haircut and bushy eyebrows in green spandex and he was looking at
Sakura .</P><P>"Hi miss my name is Rock Lee and I
was wondering if you would to be my girlfriend?" ask Lee</P><P>"I don't think you are my type."
said Sakura scared hiding behind Micheal</P><P>"And who are you sir this girl
boyfriend?" ask Lee angry looking at Micheal</P><P>"No I am not and I think you should
just get lost as you are scaring Sakura here." replied Micheal
taking off his sunglasses</P><P>"Well how about we have a spar to see
who wins the heart of this young lady?" ask Lee</P><P>"Lee what the hell do you think you
are doing?" ask a female voice</P><P>Micheal look in the direction of the
voice and saw a girl with black hair tied in two buns and wearing a
pink Chinese silk shirt and black pants and a boy next to her with
long black hair pulled into a ponytail with lavender eyes and wearing
a gray shirt and black pants and the girl didn't look very happy.</P><P>"Well TenTen I was just asking this
young man if he wanted to spar." replied Lee</P><P>"Well from the looks of it you were
looking for a fight and bothering these four. Sorry about my teammate
Lee here bothering you four. My name is TenTen and this boy next to
me is Neji." said TenTen pointing to the boy next to her</P><P>"Well it is okay. I think you friend
Lee here was just got over excited. By the way the names Micheal
Knight and these are my teammates Sakura,Ino,and Itachi." said
Micheal pointing to his three teammates</P><P>"Well it is nice to meet all of you."
said Neji</P><P>"So are you three are to take the
Chunin Exams as well?" ask Itachi</P><P>"Yes we are and we need to get going
if we don't want to be late. Right Lee." said TenTen</P><P>With that TenTen grab Lee by the ear
and drag him away from Micheal and the others.</P><P>"Well that was weird." said Ino</P><P>"Yeah that Lee is crazy but TenTen
and Neji seem to be nice people." said Sakura</P><P>"Well we better hurry if we don't
want to be late for the exams." said Micheal</P><P>With that they headed up the fleet of
stairs leading up to the next level when all of a sudden Lee appeared
behind them.</P><P>"Micheal Knight." said Lee</P><P>"Yes what do you want now Lee?" ask
Micheal</P><P>"I want you to fight me right now."
replied Lee</P><P>"Why should I agree to that?" ask
Micheal</P><P>"Because I want to prove to my
teammate Neji that I can win by only using Taijutsu." replied Lee</P><P>"Well since you appear to be in our
way of going to the Chunin Exams. I agree to you challenge and I will
beat you just so I can shut you up." said Micheal</P><P>"Micheal are you sure you can beat
this guy?" ask Sakura</P><P>"Oh course I can Sakura. All he is is
just a big pushover who thinks he is the best." replied Micheal</P><P>"Well just be careful fighting him
and make it fast as we need to get going to the Chunin Exam." said
Itachi</P><P>"I promise I will Itachi." said
Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal turn towards Lee and
activated his Sharingan which was hidden thanks to his Sunglasses.
With that Lee and Micheal charge at each other. Lee quickly went for
a roundhouse kick that Micheal dodge thanks to the Sharingan and kick
Lee in the stomach sending him flying backwards. Lee quickly got back
on his feet only to see a ball of solid ice coming at him that was
sent by Micheal that hit him hard in the hard and sent him to the
floor out cold.</P><P>"Looks like you lost this match Lee."
said Micheal to the now knock out Lee even though Lee couldn't hear
what he was saying.</P><P>With that Micheal and the others went
on their way up the stairs to the exam room leaving Lee on the floor
still out cold from the ball of ice. When they got to the top of the
stairs they saw the door to the exam room down the short hallway and
headed towards it. But before they could go inside there was cloud of
smoke and when it cleared standing in front of them were Anko and
Kurenai smiling.</P><P>"Anko and Kurenai Sensei. What are
you two doing here?" ask Ino</P><P>"Well were here to wish you four good
luck with the Chunin Exams." replied Kurenai</P><P>"Yeah and it is a good thing you all
showed up together." said Anko</P><P>"What do you mean by that?" ask
Itachi confuse</P><P>"Well you see all had to show up
together as the Chunin Exams required you all to all take it as a
team and if one of you didn't show then the others couldn't take it."
replied Kurenai</P><P>"So how did you know we would all
show up here?" ask Sakura</P><P>"Well you see you were all given a
test to see if you were ready to take the Chunin Exams and you all
pass with flying colors." replied Anko</P><P>"So you mean to tell me that the
ninja that attack me yesterday was just some test?" ask Micheal</P><P>"Yes it was and it was a good thing
Iruka use a replacement jutsu to escape or you would have killed him
with your attacks." said Kurenai</P><P>"But since you didn't and you pass.
You can take the Chunin Exmas with the rest of your team." added
Anko</P><P>"While we better get going as we need
to go talk to the Hokage. But good luck with the Chunin Exmas as me
and Anko know you will pass them no problem." said Kurenai</P><P>With that they disappeared in a cloud
of smoke. Once they were gone Micheal and the others went inside the
room and look in shock at all the ninja in the room looking at them.</P><P>"Are all these ninja here to take the
Chunin Exams?" ask Sakura shock</P><P>"I think they are Sakura." replied
Micheal</P><P>"Well Well what do we have here
Akamaru." said a voice</P><P>Micheal and the others turn around and
saw 6 kids their age looking at them.</P><P>"So what are you doing here Kiba with
Hinata and Shino?" ask Ino</P><P>What does it look like were doing here
Ino. Were here to take the Chunin Exams like Choji,Shikamaru, and
Sasuke." replied Kiba</P><P>"So who this guy with the four of
you?' ask Shino</P><P>"This is Micheal Knight from the Land
of Rain." replied Itachi</P><P>"Well he doesn't look tough to me
sis." said Sasuke looking at Micheal</P><P>"Well you would be wrong Sasuke as
Micheal here took on a Jonin Rank missing ninja and won." said
Sakura</P><P>"I heard about that from Kakashi
Sensei. He told us all about Micheal and his strange metal summon
K.I.T.T. ." said Hinata</P><P>"So you heard about K.I.T.T. ?" ask
Micheal curious</P><P>"Well me and Choji here saw you and
him around the village a few times and I can say he looks very
powerful to me." said Shikamaru</P><P>"Yeah he is and looks cool to from
what I saw of him. But I didn't know there was such a thing as a
metal summon." said Choji eating a bag of chips</P><P>"Well then you would be wrong Choji
as me,Sakura,and Itachi have seen K.I.T.T. in action and he has been
very useful on the missions he went on with us." said Ino</P><P>"Well I say that piece of metal does
not look so tough to me." said Sasuke</P><P>"Well maybe you should try fighting
against him brother as I know K.I.T.T. can kick your sorry ass all
around this village by using his E.M.P. ." said Itachi smiling</P><P>"Well it looks like you two need to
calm down." said a voice</P><P>Everyone turn in the direction of the
voice and saw Kabuto looking at them wearing a leaf headband.</P><P>"Who are you?" ask Kiba</P><P>"The names Kabuto and this is my
seventh time taking the Chunin Exmas as I failed them six times
before." replied Kabuto</P><P>"So they are that tough?" ask
Sakura</P><P>"Yes they are and believe me some of
these ninja in here have taken more times then me before." replied
Kabuto</P><P>"Man that is tough." said Itachi</P><P>"Ah can you guys excuse me for a
second as I have something to talk to Kabuto about as it is
important." said Micheal</P><P>"Why do you want to talk to this guy
alone Micheal?" ask Ino</P><P>"Because it is important and it
doesn't concern any of you alright." replied Micheal</P><P>"Sure but please make it quick."
said Sakura</P><P>"Oh course I will Sakura." replied
Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal went with Kabuto to a
corner of the room out of earshot of everyone else.</P><P>"So Kabuto have you and Tayuya found
out where K.A.R.R. is and who reactivated him?" ask Micheal</P><P>"Well we don't know where K.A.R.R. is
right now. But I do know who found him." replied Kabuto</P><P>"So who found him?" ask Micheal
fearing who it was</P><P>"It was Orochimaru who found K.A.R.R.
and reactivated him as I heard Orochimaru myself talking to someone
with a robotic voice and I saw a yellow light in the darkness before
Orochimaru made me leave the room. It seems K.A.R.R. told Orochimaru
he knew a way to get him immortality if he work with him." Replied 
Kabuto</P><P>"Well we know for a fact that
K.A.R.R. is just using Orochimaru as a pawn by lying to him saying he
knows a way of giving him immortality." said Micheal</P><P>"I know Micheal. But there is a
bigger problem we have to deal with right now." said Kabuto</P><P>"What do you mean by that?" ask
Micheal</P><P>"Well Orochimaru plans on attacking
the village in the finals of the Chunin Exams and has trick the Sand
Village into helping him. But Orochimaru does not know me an Tayuya
are not loyal to him anymore which gives us the advantage since we
know what he is planing and we can tell the Hokage and prepare for
his attack. But we need to be careful as Orochimaru is here in the
room disguise a ninja from the Grass Village" replied Kabuto</P><P>"Well then I will watch out for him
and when you are alone and away from Orochimaru. Tell the Hokage what
he is planning and to make sure the village is prepared for his
attack." said Micheal</P><P>"Oh course Micheal. But you have
better be careful or else Lady Tsunade will take her anger on you for
getting hurt." said Kabuto</P><P>"Oh course I will be careful as
always Kabuto." replied Micheal</P><P>With that their went their separate
ways and Micheal went back over to his teammates who look very
worried.</P><P>"Micheal what took you so long
getting back from talking to Kabuto?" ask Sakura worried</P><P>"Well you see me and Kabuto were
talking about something important and I guess I lost track of time."
replied Micheal</P><P>"Well we are just glad you made it
back here. So where is the person who will be giving us the Chunin
Exams?" ask Itachi</P><P>As soon as Itachi said that a man with
scars over his face on his face and wearing a leaf headband came into
the room and everyone look at him.</P><P>"Alright everyone my name is Ibiki
and I will be your proctor for the first part of the Chunin Exams.
Now take your seats and we will begin the first part of the Exams
which is a written test." said Ibiki</P><P>With that everyone took their seats and
look at Ibiki as the Chunin in the rooms handed all of them paper and
precils.</P><P>"Alright now I will explain the rules
of the exams. You will each will be given ten question the first nine
are on the paper in front of you and I will gave out the final
question at the last five minutes and will count as the rest of your
score and if you get the final question wrong then the other nine
become invaid and you and your team will fail the exam. And one more
thing if you are caught cheating five times then you and your team
will be flunk and kick out of the exam room. Now that is done you may
begin the exam." said Ibiki</P><P>With that everyone turn the paper over
and started the exam. When Micheal look at the Questions he plan on
cheating since he knew that the point of the exam was to gather
information.</P><P>"K.I.T.T. can you hear me?" ask
Micheal talking into the watch on his wrist</P><P>"Yes I can hear you Micheal and see
you with scanners since I am outside the building." replied
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Good. I want you to scan everyone
papers and tell me who has all the correct answers at once." said
Micheal</P><P>"As you wish Micheal." said
K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that K.I.T.T. scan the papers of
the other ninja from outside and found one ninja who had all the
right answers and told Micheal through the watch and Micheal wrote
them down and decide to relax until the tenth question came up. After
two hours it was time for the final question.</P><P>"Alright everyone put down your
pencils as it is tome for the final question. But before I give it
out I have something to say. If have a choice if you want to answer
this question or not. If you do and get it wrong you will failed and
you and your teammates will never be able to take the Chunin Exams
again. But you chose not to answer it then you and your team fail but
you can take the Chunin Exams another time." said Ibiki</P><P>Micheal who had listen to what Ibiki
had said know what he was up to.</P><P>"I don't believe this guy. He is
using the oldest trick in the book a classic buff. Well he isn't
fooling me as I know better then to fall for it." thought Micheal
smiling</P><P>Meanwhile Sakura,Itachi,and Ino were
watching Micheal and saw him raise his hand thinking he was giving up
when all of a sudden Micheal slam his hand on the desk and said
"Bring on the question old man. I am not afraid of failing as it
will not stop me from becoming the next Hokage." Ibiki was shock at
Micheal reaction</P><P>"Looks like this kid figured out my
buff and telling from the others reaction they pick up on his
courage." thought Ibiki smiling</P><P>"Alright since none of you are going
to leave the final question is that you all pass." said Ibiki</P><P>"What do you mean we pass?" ask
Sasuke confuse</P><P>"Well you see the final question was
a bluff to see if you would give up and you pass it with flying
colors and the first nine question were a test to see if you could
gather information with being caught by the observers in the room and
you all pass it to." said Ibiki smiling</P><P>All of a sudden the window broke into
pieces there was a cloud of smoke and when it cleared there was Anko
standing in the room with a banner behind her with her name on it.</P><P>Alright listen up your maggots the
names Anko and I will be your proctor for the second part of the
Chunin Exams." said Anko</P><P>Anko then saw all the ninja still in
the room and turn to Ibiki.</P><P>"Am I early again Ibiki?" ask Anko</P><P>"No your not Anko. All these people
test the first part of the Chunin Exams." replied Ibiki</P><P>"Well then you must be losing your
touch Ibiki." said Anko</P><P>Anko then turn to the ninja in the
room.</P><P>"Alright you maggots. I want you to
meet me tomorrow at the Forest of Death where you will be given the
second part of the Chunin Exams." said Anko</P><P>With that she vanish in a cloud of
smoke.</P><P>"I don't believe this. Anko Sensei is
our proctor for the second part of the Chunin Exams. Knowing her it
will be something dangerous and something tells me I better bring
K.I.T.T. along with me tomorrow as I have a bad feeling about this."
thought Micheal</P><P>The next morning outside the Forest of
Death Micheal and K.I.T.T. were with Sakura,Itachi,and Ino waiting
for Anko to show herself so they could find out what the second part
of the Chunin Exams were.</P><P>"So Micheal what do you think Anko
Sensei going to have everyone one do for the second part of the
Chunin Exams?" ask Sakura curious</P><P>"I don't know Sakura. But knowing
Anko Sensei. It probably will be something dangerous which is why I
brought K.I.T.T. here just in case we need his help." replied
Micheal</P><P>"Well your probably right Micheal we
might need K.I.T.T.'s help with this part of the Chunin Exams."
said Itachi</P><P>"Yeah K.I.T.T. was very useful when
we were on the mission to the Land of Birds when we need his help."
added Ino</P><P>"Well I am sure K.I.T.T. like you
saying that about him. Right K.I.T.T." said Micheal looking at
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Yes I do and don't worry me and
Micheal will make sure nothing bad happens to any you when we go into
the forest." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"So you three have nothing to worry
about since you have me and K.I.T.T. here watching your backs."
added Micheal</P><P>"And since me and K.I.T.T. know
Orochimaru is here taking the Chunin Exams disguise as a grass ninja.
I know K.A.R.R. isn't to far away watching us and since I brought
K.I.T.T. along with me. I know for sure K.A.R.R. will come out of
hiding just to get a chance to destroy K.I.T.T. since K.A.R.R. hates
K.I.T.T. with all his guts. I only hope nothing bad happens to
Sakura,Itachi,and Ino when K.A.R.R. shows up and they are not around
when he does as I don't want to tell them the truth just yet about me
and K.I.T.T. ." thought Micheal nervous</P><P>All of a sudden there was cloud of
smoke that appeared in front of everyone waiting and when it cleared
Anko stood facing them with a smile on her face.</P><P>"Well I am glad you all decided to
show up today for the second part of the Chunin exams. Now before I
explain the rules of the second part. I want you to all sign a form
that these Chunin are going to be handing out." said Anko smiling</P><P>With that the three Chunin that were
there with Anko started to pass out a form to everyone and Sakura
decided to ask a question.</P><P>"Anko Sensei what is this form we
have to sign about?" ask Sakura curious</P><P>"Well that is to tell your parents
that we are not responsible for your death which most likely will
happen in this part of the exam." replied Anko</P><P>"You got to be kidding us right Anko
Sensei?" ask Ino scared</P><P>"I don't think she is lying to us.
But I don't care as nothing is going to scared me away from this
exam." said Micheal with a smile</P><P>"Well looks like we have someone who
thinks they are tough." said Anko</P><P>All of a sudden Anko took out a kuni
and threw at Micheal at a fast speed looking like she meant to kill
him. Micheal quickly grab the kuni in his hand and threw it into a
nearby tree to the surprise to everyone watching. Micheal then saw
Anko standing in front of him with a smile on her face.</P><P>"Well looks like you are pretty tough
if you mange to catch my kuni without paying attention to me." said
Anko with a lushful look on her face</P><P>"Well I have practice all my life to
listen to my surroundings and watch out for any trouble." replied
Micheal smiling</P><P>All of a sudden to the surprise of
Micheal Anko kiss him right on the lips in front of everyone
watching. All the boys look at Micheal and couldn't figured out what
made a pretty woman like Anko want to kiss someone like Micheal. All
the girls look at them and thought to themselves Micheal must be a
very good kisser by the way he was returning Anko kiss.
Sakura,Itachi,and Ino look on in surprise at Anko and Micheal kissing
and were thinking the same thing.</P><P>"I can't believe Anko Sensei just
kiss Micheal. I wonder if he is a good kisser from the way he is
kissing her back." thought Sakura,Itachi,and Ino all at the same
time with a blush on their faces.</P><P>Once Anko and Micheal broke apart
Micheal had a huge blush on his face.</P><P>"Anko Sensei. Why did you just kiss
me for?" ask Micheal trying to get over the shock</P><P>"Well one you are definitely cute and
the type of person I like. And two I kind of falling in love with you
since you were place on my team." replied Anko with a blush on her
face</P><P>"I kind of flatter that a pretty
woman like you is interested in me. But I think we should discus this
after the exams are over as you still have to explain the rules of
the second part." said Micheal</P><P>With that Anko quickly went away from
Micheal back to her former position looking at everyone else.</P><P>"Alright since that little show is
over. I think we should forget about what happen and I will explain
the second part of the Chunin exams. The rules are that each of you
will be giving a heaven or earth scroll and your team will each go to
a gate that you will be assign to. Once your gate is open and you go
into the forest. You must get the other scroll you need from another
team using any method necessary and head to the tower in the middle
of the forest. You must get there within three days and with all the
members of your team alive. One each team will report to that tent
over next to me and receive their scroll and report to the gate that
they are told to wait at until it is time to begin." said Anko</P><P>With that each team was called one by
one until it was team 7's turn and they receive a heaven scroll and
went to their gate and waited for the signal. After waiting for 10
minutes the gates open and they ran into the forest full speed
leaping from tree to tree while K.I.T.T. follow them on the ground
keeping up with them at a fast speed.</P><P>"So how do we find out which team has
a earth scroll?" ask Sakura</P><P>"I already have something that will
help us find out who has the scroll we need." replied Micheal</P><P>"What is it?" ask Itachi curious</P><P>"Well K.I.T.T.'s scanners can scan
all the teams here in the forest and tell us with team closest to us
has a earth scroll. Right K.I.T.T.?" replied Micheal looking down
at K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Yes I can Micheal." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Well that sounds like a good plan to
me." said Ino</P><P>"Yeah and since K.I.T.T. can tell us
what team has a earth scroll then we can sneak up on them and take
them by surprise and take their scroll." said Sakura</P><P>With that they continued on their way
while K.I.T.T. use his scanners to kept a lookout for a team close to
them with a earth scroll. After 20 minutes K.I.T.T. got a hit on his
scanners and decided to tell Micheal and the others what had shown
up.</P><P>"Micheal I have found someone
carrying a earth scroll." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>'That's good news K.I.T.T. . So where
are they?" ask Micheal</P><P>"They are not far away and they seems
to be coming towards us at a fast speed. Which means they must know
we are carrying a heaven scroll and it would seem they are looking
for a fight." repiled K.I.T.T.</P><P>"That is not very good news to hear.
You three ready for fight since this person is coming towards us?"
ask Micheal looking at Sakura,Itachi,and Ino</P><P>"Yeah I am ready whenever you are
Micheal." replied Sakura</P><P>"Yeah if their looking for a fight.
Then they mess with the wrong team." said Itachi</P><P>"So lets show these jerks whose
boss." said Ino</P><P>"That's good to hear. So keep your
eyes and ears open since we don't know where they will strike from up
here." said Micheal</P><P>With that they stop and waited to see
who was it was that was going to attack them . All of a sudden from
out of no where instead of ninja coming from the trees it was a giant
snake and it was heading straight towards Sakura with it's mouth
open. Sakura was frozen in fear at the sight of the giant snake
coming at her with it's mouth wide open and she couldn't move a
muscle. Before the snake could come any closer Micheal showed up and
cut the snake in two using his dragon head katana. Micheal then grab
Sakura and brought her to the ground. Micheal then turn to Sakura.</P><P>"Are you alright Sakura?" ask
Micheal</P><P>"Yeah thanks to you." replied
Sakura</P><P>"Micheal Sakura are you two alright?"
ask Itachi running over to Micheal and Sakura with Ino</P><P>"Yeah we are both alright thanks to
Micheal using his sword on that snake." replied Sakura</P><P>"Well that is good to hear. But who
sent that snake after us?" ask Ino</P><P>"I don't know Ino. But something
tells me he isn't to far away from here." replied Micheal</P><P>"You are so right Micheal Knight."
said a voice</P><P>Everyone turn in the direction of the
voice and saw a ninja with long black hair and wearing a grass
headband.</P><P>"Who are you?" ask Sakura</P><P>"I am just ninja after your scroll."
replied the ninja</P><P>"You are lying and I know who you
are. Your the legendary Sannin Orochimauru. So why don't you just
take off your mask and show your real face." said Micheal angry</P><P>With that the ninja grab his face and
peeled it off like a mask to reveal a face that was ghost white and
with yellow snake like eyes.</P><P>"Well I guess I can't hide myself
from someone like you Micheal Knight. " said Orochimaru with a
smile</P><P>To the surprise to everyone expect
Orochimaru a kuni came from out of nowhere and landed right in front
of Orochimaru and when he look up he saw Anko standing next to
Micheal and Sakura with a look of pure hate on her face.</P><P>"Well looks like you decided to show
up Anko." said Orochimaru</P><P>"Oh course I did Orochimaru since the
Anbu showed me the body of the grass ninja you killed and took his
face. I knew you must be after something here in the forest. So I
decided to come in after you and what do I find but you attacking my
students.' replied Anko</P><P>"Well I guess I shouldn't expect
anything less from my former student." said Orochimaru smiling</P><P>"Enough talking Orochimaru. Where is
your partner?" ask Micheal</P><P>"What do you mean partner?" replied
Orochimaru in a mock voice</P><P>"You know who I mean Orochimaru. As
me and K.I.T.T. know who you are working with. So where he is right
now?" demanded Micheal in a angry tone</P><P>All of a sudden out of the corner of
his eye Micheal saw a yellow laser come out from the bushes and
headed straight towards Anko and Sakura. Micheal quickly push the
both of them to the ground just as the laser came flying over them.
Anko and Sakura look at Micheal saw that his right shoulder look
slightly burn.</P><P>"Micheal are you alright?" ask Anko
conern</P><P>"Yeah I am just a little burn but
otherwise I am okay. But are you two alright?" replied micheal</P><P>"Yeah we are fine Micheal thanks to
you. But where did that beam of light come from?" ask Sakura
confuse</P><P>"That would be me human." said a
robotic voice</P><P>Everyone turn in the direction the
voice and saw a identical car like a K.I.T.T. standing besides
Orochimaru but instead of the light on the front being red it was a
amber yellow.</P><P>"Who are you?" ask Itachi confuse</P><P>"I am the Knight Automated Roving
Robot or K.A.R.R. if you prefer." replied K.A.R.R.</P><P>"But there can't be another summon
like K.I.T.T. as Micheal found a scroll containing him." said Ino
confuse</P><P>"So that is what Micheal here told
you what K.I.T.T. was a summon like those creatures you ninja summon.
Well the truth is that me and K.I.T.T. were created by Knight
Industries over a thousand years ago until Micheal here found
K.I.T.T. and Orochimaur here found me and reactivated me." replied
K.A.R.R.</P><P>"Enough talk K.A.R.R. what is it you
want from us?" demanded K.I.T.T.</P><P>"What I want is to destroy you and
your new partner and take over this world once I am through with the
both of you." replied K.A.R.R.</P><P>"That is never going to happen
K.A.R.R. as you are going to be destroyed as I promise K.I.T.T. I
would do it when I met him five years ago." said Micheal</P><P>"Then go ahead and try Micheal Knight
as you will fail like the last two Micheal Knights did before you.
Orochimaur I want you to step aside and let me take care of these
weak fools." said K.A.R.R.</P><P>"No I will not K.A.R.R. as I have
plans for the Uchiha girl and you will not get in my way." said
Orochimaru</P><P>All of a sudden a beam of lighting came
out of K.A.R.R. and struck Orochimaru and sent him to the ground on
his knees in a lot of pain.</P><P>"You fool. Don't you ever dare
question me. If you ever want your immortality like I promise you.
Then you have better do as I say or else I will keep turning up the
voltage of lighting and give you pain like you never felt before in
your life. The only reason you aren't dead right now is because you
are still useful to me. But if you ever question my orders again then
I will kill you out right. Do I make myself clear?" said K.A.R.R.
in a angry voice</P><P>"Yes I understand you very clear
K.A.R.R. ." replied Orochimaru in a low tone</P><P>"Now since that is settled. Now I
think I will destroy you and K.I.T.T. then I will kill the people you
most care about." said K.A.R.R. turning his attention to Micheal
and K.I.T.T.</P><P>"That is never going to happen
K.A.R.R. as you will be stop right here and now. Right K.I.T.T. ?"
said Micheal turning to K.I.T.T.</P><P>"I agree with you Micheal. I think it
is time we put end to K.A.R.R. now."replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>Micheal then turn to
Sakura,Ino,Itachi,and Anko .</P><P>"I want you four to stay here while
me and K.I.T.T. go after K.A.R.R. and finish him once and for all."
said Micheal</P><P>"You got to be kidding us. Your right
shoulder is burn and K.A.R.R. just easily made Orochimaru fall to his
knees no problem." said Anko</P><P>"I know what I am doing Anko. I know
what K.A.R.R . is capable of as does K.I.T.T. and I don't want to see
the people precious to me get hurt and I promise once this is over
then I will tell you four the truth about me an K.I.T.T. ." said
Micheal</P><P>"Fine but please be careful Micheal."
said Sakura</P><P>"I promise I will Sakura. Believe
it." said Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal got inside K.I.T.T.
and they headed towards K.A.R.R. as K.A.R.R. decided to charge them
as well. The first thing Micheal did was fired a missile right at
K.A.R.R that he avoided and fired his laser that hit K.I.T.T. causing
him damage. Micheal quickly reacted by trying to fire K.I.T.T's laser
at K.A.R.R. who ended up using his turbo boost to go up and over
K.I.T.T. . K.A.R.R then transform into attack mode and fired a few
missiles at K.I.T.T who avoided two of them but ended up getting hit
by the other two that cause K.I.T.T. more damage and Micheal was
trying to get K.I.T.T.'s repair systems online.</P><P>"K.I.T.T. how are we looking?" ask
Micheal concern</P><P>"My repair system is offline for the
next five minutes and I have lost most of my weapons and the turbo
boost. I am afraid K.A.R.R. is more powerful then we first thought
and I am afraid we might not make it through this." replied
K.I.T.T. in a worried tone</P><P>"Looks like you and your partner have
failed to stop me K.I.T.T. , Now I think it is time I finish you both
off." said K.A.R.R.</P><P>With that K.A.R.R. prepared to deliver
the final blow when all of a sudden he was hit by a few missiles that
came out of nowhere and sent him backwards a couple of feet.</P><P>"Who dares infer with me?" demanded
K.A.R.R.</P><P>"That would be me K.A.R.R. "replied
a robotic voice</P><P>Micheal and K.I.T.T. look in the
direction of the voice and saw a red dodge viper heading towards
K.A.R.R. and saw it transform into a silver color with a roof and a
rocket launcher coming out of it's side aim at K.A.R.R.</P><P>"You. I thought you were dismantled
and shut down for good." said K.A.R.R. angry</P><P>"You would be wrong there K.A.R.R.
Charles Graiman our creator saved my personality chip and put it into
the Viper Defender that he help build and shut me down until the day
you were reactivated and I would be needed to help K.I.T.T. and
Micheal Knight destroy you once and for all." replied the Viper</P><P>"K.I.T.T. who is that car?" ask
Micheal looking at the viper</P><P>"That would be the Knight Industries
Two thousand the original K.I.T.T. that Charles Graiman created for
the first Micheal Knight along with K.A.R.R.. Charles Graiman was
suppose to have dismantle him but ended up putting his personality
chip into the Viper Defender that he help built a long time ago and
shut him down until the day K.A.R.R. was reactivated and we needed
his help in defeating K.A.R.R. . " replied K.I.T.T</P><P>"So if the first K.I.T.T. has been
reactivated then who is driving him?" ask Micheal confuse</P><P>"I don't have no idea Micheal."
replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>Meanwhile K.A.R.R. had gotten over the
shock at seeing the original K.I.T.T. and was prepare to battle him.</P><P>"You may have survive being
dismantled but I will destroy you once and for all as now I can
destroy both the original K.I.T.T. and the new K.I.T.T. together and
prove to everyone that I am suprior to the two of you." said
K.A.R.R.</P><P>With that K.A.R.R. charge the original
K.I.T.T. in his attack mode and fired some missiles at him with the
first K.I.T.T. avoided by firing his own. The first K.I.T.T. then
fired then fired his own missiles and rockets at K.A.R.R. that hit
him and sent him backwards. When K.A.R.R. came to a stop he was ready
to finish the first K.I.T.T. off with a laser when all of a sudden he
was hit by a laser from out of nowhere and look to see that K.I.T.T.
was now repaired and coming at him in attack mode and saw that the
first K.I.T.T. had join him as well.</P><P>"Well look like both K.I.T.T.'s have
decided to join forces to take me down." said K.A.R.R</P><P>"Face it K.A.R.R. you have no chance
of defeating both of us." said the first K.I.T.T.</P><P>"So just give up as you have no hope
of winning against the two of us." added K.I.T.T.</P><P>"I might not have expected for the
original K.I.T.T. to show up. But I will tell you this right now the
next time we meet I will be ready for the both of you and that is a
promise I will make to the both of you." said K.A.R.R.</P><P>With that K.A.R.R. fired a barrage of
missiles at the ground and there was a cloud of smoke and when it
cleared K.A.R.R. had vanish as had Orochimaru.</P><P>"Looks like K.A.R.R. got away this
time." said Micheal</P><P>"Yes but next time will be different
Micheal." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that Micheal got out of K.I.T.T.
and saw Anko,Itachi,Sakura,and Ino running over to him and tackle him
to the ground.</P><P>"Micheal are we glad you and K.I.T.T.
are alright." said Anko</P><P>"Yeah we were all worried about you."
said Sakura</P><P>"Well you can see me and K.I.T.T. are
alright. So do you think you can let me up ?" said Micheal</P><P>With that they got off of Micheal and
he got to his feet and look at the original K.I.T.T. .</P><P>"Micheal care to tell us the truth
about you and K.I.T.T. and who this K.A.R.R. is?" ask Itachi
curious</P><P>"Well before I tell you the truth
about me and K.I.T.T. . I would like to know who is behind the wheel
of the original K.I.T.T. that saved me and K.I.T.T. from K.A.R.R. ."
replied Micheal</P><P>"That would be me." said a female
voice</P><P>Everyone turn around to see woman with
long brown hair and eyes wearing a red shirt blue jeans and black
sneaker that had gotten out of the original K.I.T.T. and looking at
them.</P><P>"Who are you?" ask Ino curious</P><P>"Her name is Sarah Graiman the
daughter of the late Charles Graimen the man who built me and the
original K.I.T.T. along with K.A.R.R. . But you suppose to have died
a thousand years ago Sarah. So how can you still be alive?" replied
K.I.T.T. confuse</P><P>"Well you see K.I.T.T. the reason I
am still alive is because Knight Industries decided to put me into
statis when I was suffering from cancer until the machine could cure
me which would be a long time. So it was decided by Knight Industries
that I would be put with the first K.I.T.T. when he was shut down
until the day K.A.R.R. was reactivated and you and Micheal here
needed us to help you with K.A.R.R. and destroy him once and for all.
But unfortunately K.A.R.R. mange to escape before we had a chance to
destroy him for good. But I have a feeling we have not seen the last
of him." replied Sarah sadly</P><P>"Your probably right Sarah. K.A.R.R.
will not rest until me and both K.I.T.T.'s are destroyed and he tries
to complete his plans whatever they are." said Micheal</P><P>"Okay can someone please explain what
you two are talking about as the four of us want to know right now."
said Anko getting confuse</P><P>"Oh course you see my father Charles
Graimen built K.A.R.R. and the original K.I.T.T. over a thousand
years ago for Knight Industries whose job it was to protect the world
from evil people. But K.A.R.R. ended up reprogramming himself to only
think of self preservation and viewed humans as not worth protecting
and decided they needed to be wipe out and he should rule as ruler of
the world. So it was decided that he would be put into storage until
the problem could be fix. But of course two thieves broke into the
warehouse where K.A.R.R. was they ended up releasing him and the
original K.I.T.T. and the first Micheal Knight mange to defeat him
twice after K.A.R.R. was reactivated and it was presume he was
destroyed. But of course K.A.R.R. was then rebuilt Alex Torres and my
late husand the second Micheal Knight was to be the driver. But of
course K.A.R.R. ended up going berserk and ended up killing seven
people and Micheal's memory of that incident was wipe out. But a few
years later after Micheal and K.I.T.T. were working as a team. Alex
Torres decide to take out K.I.T.T.'s personality chip and put it in
K.A.R.R. as he thought it would allow them to control him which my
father knew before he died wouldn't work. But my father sent me and
Micheal a message saying that Alex Torres was trying to restart the
K.A.R.R. program and thanks to the help of our friends Billy and Zoe
we mange to reactivate K.I.T.T. and he and Micheal went after
K.A.R.R. to destroy him once and for all. Once they got to the
location K.A.R.R. showed up and attack them but ultimately was
defeated once again and we presume he had been destroyed for good.
But of course some people thought K.A.R.R. was still worth to rebuild
and thought they could control him. So after they rebuilt K.A.R.R.
they shut him down and put him into storage until they could finally
find a way to control him. But they could never find a way to do it
and K.A.R.R. was quickly forgotten until Orochimaru found K.A.R.R.
and reactivated him and K.A.R.R. promise to help Orochimaur
immortality if Orochimaur agreed to help K.A.R.R. destroy K.I.T.T.
and Micheal here once and for all. After me and the original K.I.T.T.
learn of this using the computer in the lab where we were stored. We
decided to come to the village as we knew K.A.R.R. would be after
K.I.T.T. here to destroy him once and for all." replied Sarah</P><P>"I can understand that story. But
where does Micheal here fit into all of this?" ask Sakura confuse</P><P>"Well you see Sakura I mange to come
across the remains of Knight Industries five years ago where I met
K.I.T.T. and I train to become a ninja and the next Micheal Knight. I
mange to reform Knight Industries to find out where K.A.R.R. was
hidden and destroy him once and for all. But of course I was to late
as me and K.I.T.T. found out when we came across the remains of
Mizuki and his ninja and found out K.A.R.R. had killed them using
some of his missiles and the reason me and K.I.T.T. didn't tell you
was because we didn't want to worry you about him and worry you would
not believe our story." replied Micheal</P><P>""We can understand you wanting to
protect us Micheal. But we have to believe you now since we saw
K.A.R.R. with our own eyes. But we do have now more question to ask
about you." said Ino</P><P>"What is it you want to know?" ask
Micheal knowing what the question would be</P><P>"If your name isn't really Micheal
Knight then what is your real name?" ask Sakura curious</P><P>"If you must know. I which to be know
as Naruto Uzumaki and the reason I change my appearance is because I
wanted the village to think I was still dead after all these years as
they would try to attack me for being the container to Kyuubi."
replied Micheal</P><P>"Well you should have told us you
were alive as me,Sakura,and Ino thought you were dead all these years
and the three of us were in love with you ever since you saved us
from those bullies when we were five." said Itachi in a angry tone</P><P>"You mean you three have been in love
with me ever since we were five." said Micheal shock</P><P>"Yes we were. But that doesn't change
the fact you lied to the three of us about being alive." said Ino
mad</P><P>" I am very sorry I had to do that to
the three of you as if I had know how you felt about me then I would
have told you three the truth sooner. And the only reason I did not
tell you is because I didn't want to see K.A.R.R. hurt you if you
three were close to me." said Micheal in a sad voice</P><P>"You mean to tell us you care about
the three of us?" ask Sakura shock</P><P>"Yes I do very much as I care the
same about Kyuubi,Ayame and Anko sensei here. So just tell me what I
can do to make it up to the three of you." replied Micheal</P><P>"Well there is one way you can make
it up to the three of us." said Itachi in a sneaky smile</P><P>"What would that be?" ask Micheal
confuse</P><P>"You have to kiss the three of us
like you kiss Anko Sensei and then we will forget about the fact you
hid the fact you were still alive from the three of us." replied
Ino</P><P>"I think I can do that." said
Micheal</P><P>With that Micheal went to each girl and
gave them a kiss on the lips. After he gave each of them a kiss they
all had a huge blush on their faces.</P><P>"Well it looks likes everything is
settled here. But I do have a question that has being bugging me
Micheal." said Anko</P><P>"What would that be Anko Sensei?"
ask Micheal confuse</P><P>"Well if the woman you are living
with is name Kyuubi. Does she happen to be the same Kyuubi that the
fourth Hokage sealed in you 12 years ago?" ask Anko curious</P><P>"Yes she is and I ended up freeing
her from the seal when I was 9 and the reason she attack the village
was because Orochimaru trick her by trying to put a curse seal mark
on her which drove her berserk and went after him and ended up in the
village where the ninja attack her and she tried to defend herself
the best she could without trying to kill them. I promise myself
after I freed her that I would hunt down Orochimaru and killed him
for tricking Kyuubi by hurting her and that is a promise that I
attain to keep this time." replied Micheal</P><P>"I think that sounds like a good plan
Micheal and I hope Orochimaru pay for what he did to Kyuubi. But what
are we going to do about K.A.R.R. ?" ask Sakura</P><P>"Well you four should continue with
the Chunin Exams and me and the original K.I.T.T. here will go to
Knight Industries and meet with Madara as we contacted him on our way
here to help you with K.A.R.R.. " replied Sarah</P><P>"Yes but I would like you all to call
me Viper since I am in the Viper Defender body and it will help you
all not to confuse me with K.I.T.T. here." said Viper</P><P>"I think that is a good name. But how
are we going to make pass the second part of the Chunin Exams without
a Earth Scroll ?" ask Micheal</P><P>"I have that all covered for you."
said Sarah throwing a Earth Scroll that Sakura caught in her hand</P><P>"How did you mange to get a hold of a
Earth Scroll?" ask Sakura confuse</P><P>"Well you see on the way here a team
of ninja thought it would be wise to attack me and Viper thinking it
would be easy expect the fact that Viper use his E.M.P. To knock them
out and since according to Madara you four had a Heaven Scroll and
the ninja we encounter had a Earth Scroll. I decided to take it with
us knowing you would need it to pass the second part of the exams."
replied Sarah</P><P>"Thanks a lot Sarah." said Itachi</P><P>"Don't mention it. Now if you can
excuse me . I have to get going to Knight Industries and tell Madara
what I know about K.A.R.R. and think of a plan to destroy him once
and for all." said Sarah</P><P>With that Sarah got inside of Viper and
they drove off towards Knights Industries to talk to Madara. Anko
then look at the four of them.</P><P>"I have to get going to and report
all of this to the Hokage and something tell me he knows all about
this from you Micheal." said Anko looking at Micheal</P><P>With that she disappeared in a breeze
of leaves leaving the four genin alone.</P><P>"We better get going to the tower as
we have both scrolls and something tells me that Orochimaru and
K.A.R.R. are not done with us." said Micheal</P><P>With that they all took off towards the
tower. After traveling for two hours they finally reach the tower as
it was starting to get dark and came to a door the led into the
tower.</P><P>"Alright K.I.T.T. I want you to head
back to the house and tell Kyuubi and Ayame everything that happen
here in the forest. Alright partner." said Micheal looking at
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"I understand Micheal. I will let
them know right away." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that K.I.T.T. took off heading
towards the house to tell Kyuubi and Ayame everything that happen so
far. Once K.I.T.T. was gone Micheal and the others open the door and
went inside the tower and look around.</P><P>"I think this is where we open both
scrolls." said Sakura</P><P>"I think you are right Sakura. We
should open both scrolls and see what happens." said Itachi</P><P>With that both girls open the scrolls
and smoke started to fill the room and they drop both scrolls on the
floor and when the smoke finally cleared they saw Iruka standing in
front of them smiling.</P><P>"Congratulations you four on passing
the second part of the Chunin exams two days early." said Iruka
smiling</P><P>"Iruka Sensei what are you doing
here?" ask Ino</P><P>"Well I am here to congratulate you
four on passing this part of the exams and I felt it was only right
if I was the one to tell you the good news." replied Iruka</P><P>"So can you tell us what the next
part of the Chunin Exmas are about Iruka Sensei?" ask Micheal</P><P>"I am afraid I can't do that Micheal
as it is the Hokage job since he will be the to tell you what the
next part is about. But until then you four should get some rest as
you must have had a long journey getting here and you will needed
when the next part of the Chunin Exams are explain two days from
now." replied Iruka</P><P>With that Iruka disappeared into a
cloud of smoke leaving the four of them alone again.</P><P>"So what do we do until the next part
of the Chunin Exmas?" ask Sakura confuse</P><P>"Well we should do as Iruka Sensei
said and just relax and get some rest until the next part of the
Exams." replied Micheal</P><P>"That sounds like a good plan as we
do need the rest after the fight you had with K.A.R.R. ." said
Itachi</P><P>"And you can tell us more about what
happen over the last five years since you were gone from the village
and made everyone think you were dead." said Ino</P><P>"I guess I can do that. But I will
tell you it is a very long story. But since we got all the time right
now. I think you deserve to know what happen to me during the last
five years if we are going to any relationship." said Micheal</P><P>With that they all head to their
sleeping quarters and listen to Micheal's story about what happen to
him over the last five years since he was gone. Two days later it was
time for the next part of the Chunin Exams and the four of them had
enter a huge room fulled of ninja waiting for the next part of the
Chunin Exams to start and saw the other rookie genin had made it as
well.</P><P>"Micheal it is good to see you and
your team have made it." said Kabuto who was next to him</P><P>"Well I am just glad we all made it
through the Forest of Death and are here. So how are things going
with finding a way of destroying K.A.R.R.?" ask Micheal</P><P>"Well thanks to Sarah showing us the
blueprints of K.A.R.R.'s body we are close to finding a weak spot in
his design. But is it is a good idea for us to talk in front of your
teammates about K.A.R.R ?" replied Kabuto looking at
Sakura,Itachi,and Ino</P><P>"If you mean we know about Micheal
and K.A.R.R.. Then it is a little late for that since we saw K.A.R.R.
and Micheal told us the truth about everything." said Sakura</P><P>"But you don't have to worry about us
telling anyone about what we know as we are in love with Micheal and
we don't want to worry the village about K.A.R.R. as no one would
believe it." added Itachi</P><P>"Well since you three know
everything. Then allow me to interdouce the real self. The names
Kabuto and I work for Knight Industries and I am a friend of Micheal
and Kyuubi as well as K.I.T.T. ." said Kabuto</P><P>"So you work for Knight Industries as
Micheal does?" ask Ino curious</P><P>"Yes he does. But Kabuto also works
for Orochiamru as a double agent for us as does Tayuya and they
report anything that Orochiamru has plan. Such as the attack that
Orochimaru is planing on the village that I told the three of you
about." replied Micheal</P><P>"That is correct and once I drop out
of the exams like I always do at this point and report to Orochiamru.
I plan on going to the Hokage and telling him what Orochiamru has
plan for the village so the village is prepare for the attack."
said Kabuto</P><P>With that said they went back to
waiting for the next part of the Chunin Exams to start. After waiting
for 20 minutes the Hokage appeared on the stand in front of everyone
with some Jonin looking at all the genin.</P><P>"Alright everyone. I have something
to say to all of you before we get to the next part of the Chunin
Exmas."said Sarutobi</P><P>With that all the genin look at the
Hokage giving their full attention.</P><P>"Alright since I got your attention.
What I have to say is since so many of you have pass the second part
of the Chunin Exams. I have decided to hold a set of preliminary
matches to see which of you will make it to the finals of the Chunin
Exmas. If you feel you are not ready for this and need rest then just
raise your hand and your other teammates can still complete." said
Sarutobi</P><P>With that Kabuto raise his hand and
said he was to tired to go on in the preliminary matches and left the
room with only Micheal and the rest of team 7 knowing why Kabuto
decide to quit. Once Kabuto was gone the rest of the genin went up to
the balconies over looking the room and the proctor who would be
overseeing the matches told everyone to watch the screen for their
names to appear and come down to the floor for their match. With that
Micheal watch as the first match that was between Sasuke and another
ninja started and Sasuke mange to win it using a jutsu that he use to
send the ninja into the ground knocking him out. The next match was
between Neji and Hinata which Micheal found out that the two of them
were cousins. Neji ended up winning the match by defeating Hinata to
the point to where he almost killed her and she had to be carried out
on a stretcher and Micheal promise himself when he face Neji he would
make him pay for what he did to Hinata. The next match was between
Sakura and Ino which made it hard on the two of them as they were
best friends. But after Sakura told Ino that they should see each
other as ninja then friends they quickly went after each other with
all they got and the match was declared a draw as both girls had
ended up sending each other to the floor exhausted. The next match
was between Itachi and Choji which she won by using her Sharingan to
keep track of Choji's moves and used her families fire jutsu to knock
him out. After that Micheal watch the next few matches until his name
had been called and found out his opponent was Kiba who had his dog
Akaimaru with him. With that Micheal went down to the floor and saw
Kiba looking at him smiling.</P><P>"Well it looks like I am going to win
this match easy since you don't look strong to me new guy. Right
Akaimaru?" said Kiba looking at his dog to bark in agreement</P><P>"I hate to break to you Kiba. But I
am a lot stronger then I look as I will prove it by beating you."
said Micheal putting on his sunglasses</P><P>"Then go ahead and prove it smart
guy." said Kiba</P><P>With that the match begin and Kiba
charge Micheal with his claw like nails with Micheal avoided thanks
to using his Sharigan that was hidden thanks to his sunglasses and
then fired a ball of solid ice at Kiba that hit him in the chest
sending him to the ground on his knees. Micheal then saw Kiba give
Akaimaru a pill that turn him all red and bigger and then Kiba made
some handsigns and transform Akaimaru into a clone of himself and
charge at Micheal and trap him in a wall of wind and he was getting
hit by Kiba and Akaimaru from all sides.</P><P>"Man I had enough of this playing
around with these two fools. It time to show them what Excalibur can
do." thought Micheal taking Excalibur out of it's scabbard and
pointed it at Kiba and Akaimaru</P><P>At that moment Kiba though he was going
to win the match when he saw Micheal draw Excalibur and all of a
sudden he and Akaimaru were blinded by a bright flash of light that
was as bright as the sun itself and Micheal use the chance to swing
Excalibur at Akaimaru sending him to the ground knock out and back in
his true form. Kiba who was still blinded by the light from Excalibur
didn't notice Micheal prepare a Rasengan in his hand and charge at
him. By the time Kiba could focus he was hit by Micheal's Rasengan
that hit him in the chest and sent him into the wall hard and landed
on the ground knock out.</P><P>The winner of this match is Micheal
Knight." said the Proctor</P><P>With that Micheal headed up to the
balcony where Sakura,Itachi,and Ino were waiting for him smiling.</P><P>"Micheal you won." said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah you totally beat Kiba no
problem." said Ino</P><P>"Thanks you two." replied Micheal</P><P>"So what was that sword you use on
Kiba that made that bright flash of light?" ask Itachi curious</P><P>"That would be the legendary sword
Excalibur that I found in a old tomb when I was on a mission given to
me by Madara and it happen to belong to a person called King Arthur
who ended up becoming a legend. But I will tell you more about it
later when we are alone. Right now lets just watch the rest of the
matches." replied Micheal</P><P>With they look back over the room and
watch the rest of the matches. Once the rest of the matches were
over. Micheal stood with the rest of the finalist and look at the
Hokage.</P><P>"Now that you all have won your
matches. The finals of the Chunin Exmas will be held a month for now.
So I suggest you all get some rest and work on some new jutsu since
you know what everyone here is using. So until then good luck and
best of wishes to you all in the finals." said Sarutobi</P><P>With that he left leaving them all
alone and Michael was looking at Sakura,Itachi and Ino.</P><P>"I hope Sarah can help Madara find a
weak spot in K.A.R.R.'s design so me and K.I.T.T. can take hi done
once and for all before he and Orochimaru can harm any innocent
people and I can protect the people I love the most from harm. I
promise that I will not rest until K.A.R.R. is destroyed for good and
the world is safe. That is a promise of a lifetime." thought
Micheal determination in his eyes</P><P>That's it for this chapter. So what do
you think about the appearance of the original K.I.T.T. from the old
knight rider series in the Viper Defender Body and the appearance of
Sarah Graiman from the new Knight Rider series as well. The reason
did it was because I thought it would be right since I want to make
K.A.R.R. a powerful villain that Michael and K.I.T.T. couldn't handle
by themselves and to honor fans of the original Knight Rider. .As
always please Review and leave comments as I want people's thought's
on this story. Thanks and stay tune for the next chapter for a big
surpirse.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><p>Stranded Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto or Knight Rider. Naruto is own by Masashi Kishimoto and Knight Rider is own by NBC. I don't make money off this story. AN: There will be a slight crossover with Yugioh and the characters Rio from Spiral and Eve will from Blackcat will appear as they are part of Michael's Harem and I don't own any of them.</p><p>It now had been two weeks since the preliminaries of the Chunin Exams and during that time Michael had been training hard to prepare for his match against Neji and working hard with K.I.T.T. to get stronger so they could defeat K.A.R.R. the next time he show up. Also during that time Ayame and Anko had moved in with him and Kyuubi as they thought since they were his girlfriends now as were Sakura,Itachi,and Ino it felt right that they should move in with their future husband while Sakura,Itachi,and Ino decided to stay with their parents until they felt it was time for them to move in as well. Michael was in the living room of the house getting ready to go for a jog and thinking about everything that had happen so far since he got back to the village.</p><p>"I can't believe that K.A.R.R. is still on the loose and working with Orochimaru. I sure hope Sarah can help Knight Industries find a weak spot in K.A.R.R.'s design since her father built him and she showed Madara K.A.R.R.' s blueprints. Because right now K.A.R.R. is to powerful for me and K.I.T.T. to take on alone. But I swear with my soul K.A.R.R. will be destroyed once and for all before he can hurt any innocent people and I can finally start a life with the six people I love the most." thought Michael</p><p>"Something on your mind Michael?" said a female voice</p><p>Michael look in the direction of the voice and saw Kyuubi,Ayame and Anko standing their with concern looks on their faces.</p><p>"Yeah I am just thinking about how me and K.I.T.T. are going to defeat K.A.R.R. once and for all before he can hurt any innocent people." replied Michael</p><p>"Well knowing you and K.I.T.T. Michael I am sure you can defeat K.A.R.R. no problem." said Ayame</p><p>"Besides Sarah is working on a way to defeat K.A.R.R. by looking over his blueprints trying to find a weak spot in his design. So I wouldn't worry about K.A.R.R. since you have Sarah on the case helping you and Knight Industries since her father did build him." said Anko</p><p>"Your right you three. Knowing Sarah I know she will find a weak spot in K.A.R.R.'s design that me and K.I.T.T can use to destroy him once and for all." said Michael</p><p>"That's more like it Michael. Your thinking about the good side of things. So right now you should focus on training for your match against Neji and let Sarah and Knight Industries work on a way for you and K.I.T.T. to destroy him." said Kyuubi</p><p>"Well speaking of me training for the Chunin Exams. I should go for my jog right now that way I can take my mind off K.A.R.R. for a while and focus on my training." said Michael</p><p>"While then you better get going then Michael and don't forget that Sakura,Itachi,and Ino are going over for dinner tonight." said Ayame</p><p>"I promise I will not forget Ayame." replied Michael</p><p>With that Michael give Kyuubi,Ayame and Anko a kiss on the lips goodbye and went out the door and started his jog for the day. Meanwhile in Orochimaru's lair Orochimaru was looking at Kabuto who was in the room on one knee bowing to Orochimaru.</p><p>"So Kabuto how are things going with our plan to attack the village?" ask Orochimaru looking at Kabuto</p><p>"Everything is going according to your plan Lord Orochimaru. The Sand Village has receive your orders are ready to attack with us at the finales of the Chunin Exams as you wanted my lord." replied Kabuto</p><p>"That is very good to hear Kabuto. Now how about Michael Knight. You have found out anything about him and K.I.T.T.?" ask Orochimaru</p><p>"Well I am very sorry to report I have found out nothing about Michael Knight and his friend K.I.T.T. my lord. But me and Tayuya are continuing to find out what we can on them." replied Kabuto</p><p>"Well that is to bad because I would like to have know where he came from and where he got K.I.T.T. from as well. But that doesn't matter as my plans to attack the village are going good. You can go now Kabuto and let me know at once if you find anything out about Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. . " said Orochimaru</p><p>"As you wish my lord." said Kabuto bowing</p><p>"And once we find out K.A.R.R.' s weakness Orochimaru. Then I am going to make sure you don't harm anyone else ever again. " thought Kabuto as he left the room.</p><p>Once Kabuto left Orochimaru look behind him at K.A.R.R. who had watch the entire thing.</p><p>"So what do you think of my plan to attack the village K.A.R.R. ?" ask Orochimaru smiling</p><p>"I think it is a good plan as I am sure that Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. will try to stop the attack and no doubt that the original K.I.T.T. will help them as well which I am counting on as I plan to destroy all three of them together. But I do have a problem with your servant Kabuto. I have a feeling he isn't has loyal as you think he is as is Tayuya as it seems that Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. knew you were the one who reactivated me." replied K.A.R.R.</p><p>"Well your wrong about that K.A.R.R. as I know for a fact that Kabuto and Tayuya would never think about betraying me as I have given them power beyond anything they could dream about." said Orochimaru in a angry tone</p><p>All of a sudden Orochimaru was struck by a blot of lighting that came from K.A.R.R. and sent him to the ground on his knees in pain .</p><p>"Don't ever tell me that I am wrong about something Orochimaru as I am never wrong about something like this. If I find out that Kabuto and Tayuya have been working with Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. and they told him that you were the one who reactivated me then it will be you that will be the one to pay for their betrayal if it happens. Do I make myself clear you weak fool." said K.A.R.R. in a angry voice filled with killing intent</p><p>"Crystal Clear." replied Orochimaru in pain</p><p>With that K.A.R.R. cut off the lighting and Orochimaru felt the pain go away.</p><p>"Good to know you know who is the boss around here Orochimaru. Now we should discus my plan to take down Michael Knight and both K.I.T.T.'s " said K.A.R.R. looking at Orochimaru who had gotten back to his feet.</p><p>Meanwhile back in the village Michael was jogging pass the Hot springs when he saw a man in his fifties with long white hair and two red lines on his face dress in a fishnet shirt , brown gray shirt,with a red vest and black pants with a headband on his head with the sign of toad sage on it. Michael notice that the man was peeking into the ladies room with a huge smile on his face.</p><p>"I don't believe this. What the hell is Jiraiya doing here in the village. Judging from the look of things he is probably looking into the ladies room for research for one of his books. While I better put a stop to this before something bad happens which I know will." thought Michael rolling his eyes over</p><p>With that Michael went over to Jiraiya to stop what he was doing. At that moment Jiraiya was looking into the ladies room with a huge smile on his.</p><p>"Man this is great stuff for my next book." said Jiraiya to himself smiling</p><p>"Jiraiya what the hell do you think you are doing peeping into the ladies room?" said Michael's voice shouting</p><p>When Michael said that about 15 woman came out of the ladies room and came over to Jiraiya and started to pound on him before he could do anything. After it was all over Jiraiya was now face first in the ground with bruises all over his body.</p><p>"Who the hell just ruin my research?" demanded Jiraiya angry</p><p>"That would be me Jiraiya." replied Michael</p><p>Jiraiya turn in the direction of the voice and saw Michael standing in front of him with a annoyed look on his face</p><p>"Michael I should have know it was you. Your the only one who ever does that to me expect for Tsunade. So care to tell me what you are doing in the village?" ask Jiraiya</p><p>"Well I am here in the village Jiraiya because I am a ninja of the village now and I am training for the finales of the Chunin Exmas." replied Michael</p><p>"Well that is very interesting to hear Michael. So how are things with Kyuubi and K.I.T.T. ?" said Jiraiya curious</p><p>"Everything is going fine with the both of them. But something happen that I think you should know about Jiraiya." replied Michael</p><p>"Well judging from the look on your face. I say it must be something bad. So what happen?" ask Jiraiya</p><p>"Well K.A.R.R. has been reactivated and almost beat me and K.I.T.T. in the Forest of Death but the original K.I.T.T. and Sarah Graiman mange to show up just in time and made K.A.R.R. retreat." replied Michael</p><p>"That is bad news if K.A.R.R. has been reactivated. But who was the one who reactivated him in the first place?" ask Jiraiya not wanting to know the answer</p><p>"It was none other then Orochimaru who reactivated K.A.R.R. . K.A.R.R. told Orochimaur that he knew of a way of getting immortality if Orochimaur work with him. Which we know K.A.R.R. lied about so he could come after me and K.I.T.T. and make Orochimaru work with him to complete his plans whatever they are." replied Michael</p><p>"Man that isn't good to hear. If what you saying is true then it can only mean bad things if those two are working together. Which means you will have to watch your back at all times as will K.I.T.T. . " said Jiraiya</p><p>"I know that very well Jiraiya. Which is why Madara and Sarah are going over the blueprints of K.A.R.R. trying to find a weak spot in his design so we can use it to destroy him once and for all. But until then I have to train hard for the finales of the Chunin Exams so I can defeat Neji and anyone else I have to face and just be prepared when Orochimaru and K.A.R.R. make their move." said Michael</p><p>"While in that case how about I train you for the Chunin Exams since I train you a few years ago when Tsunade brought you to me to train you like I did your father so many years ago." said Jiraiya</p><p>"You got a deal Jiraiya. But only if you teach me more powerful jutsu and you don't peep on any woman well you train me." said Michael</p><p>"You got a deal Michael." said Jiraiya shaking Michael's hand</p><p>All of a sudden their was a sound of a engine and when Michael and Jiraiya looking the direction of the sound they saw K.I.T.T. pulling up in front of them.</p><p>"K.I.T.T. what are you doing here?" ask Michael looking at K.I.T.T.</p><p>"I am here to tell you Sarah wants to see you at once back at Knight Industries and that it is something important you have to talk to her about as soon as possible." replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>"So do you have any idea what she wants to talk about with me?" ask Michael</p><p>"I don't really know the answer to that question Michael. But I suggest we leave right now to see what Sarah has to talk about with you." replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Alright K.I.T.T. then we should head to Knight Industries right now to see what Sarah has to discus with me. Sorry about not getting our training started today Jiraiya." said Michael looking at Jiraiya</p><p>"It's okay Michael. We can train tomorrow since it looks like you have something more important to handle right now." replied Jiraiya</p><p>With that Michael said goodbye to Jiraiya and hop inside K.I.T.T. and they headed towards Knight's Industries. After 10 minutes of driving they came to the well where the villagers had thrown Michael down five years ago. All of a sudden the ground near the well open up to reveal a hole in the ground which Michael and K.I.T.T. drove down into a tunnel and the doors at the end open up and they came to the main room of Knight Industries and they park in the middle of the room and Michael got out of K.I.T.T. and saw Madara standing in front of him.</p><p>"Good to see you could come Michael." said Madara</p><p>"Well I am here Madara. So where is Sarah?" ask Michael</p><p>"I am right here Michael and I am glad you could come as I have something important to talk to you about." replied Sarah appearing next to Madara</p><p>"So what is it you want to talk to me about Sarah?" ask Michael curious</p><p>"Well just follow me Madara's office as what I need to talk to you about is best if we talk alone." replied Sarah</p><p>With that Michael followed Sarah to Madara's office and once they were inside Sarah close the door behind them and look at Michael.</p><p>"So now that we are alone Sarah. What is it that is so important you had K.I.T.T. come get me when I was going to train with Jiraiya?" ask Michael</p><p>"Well you remember when I told you about my husband the last Michael Knight and our son." replied Sarah</p><p>"Yeah you told me all about them Sarah. So what does this have to do with what you have to tell me?" said Michael confuse</p><p>"Well ever since I met you I have felt deep connection to you like we are somehow related by blood. So I decided to run some D.N.A. test out of curiosity as I couldn't shake off this feeling." replied Sarah</p><p>"So what did you find out from the test results?" ask Michael curious</p><p>"Well the feeling I had was right. The results showed you are the direct descendant of me and my husband Michael's son. Which means we are related to one another." replied Sarah</p><p>"So this means your grandmother by over a thousand years?" ask Michael trying to grasp this new information</p><p>"Yes I am Michael and to tell the truth you remind me of my husband Michel by the way you act and treat other people." replied Sarah</p><p>"So that must be why me and K.I.T.T. work so well together because the last Michael Knight was my ancestor and that makes you my only living relative." said Michael trying to get over the shock of the news</p><p>"Yes and I am glad I am related to you Michael as you are closest thing I have to Michael and my son left." said Sarah</p><p>"Well I am glad to that I have someone in my family that I am related to. But does this mean I can call you grandma?" said Michael</p><p>"Yes you can but only in front of me and your mother Tsunade. Is that understood Michael." replied Sarah</p><p>"Yes Grandma. So how are things going with trying to find a weak spot in K.A.R.R.'s design that me and K.I.T.T. can use to destroy him once and for all?" ask Michael</p><p>"Well so far I haven't being able to find a weak spot in K.A.R.R.'s design from the his blueprints but I am sure there must be one in his design that I have overlook somewhere in K..'s blueprints." replied Sarah</p><p>"Well I know you will find a weak spot in K.A.R.R.'s design sooner or later and when you do we can use it against him to destroy him once and for all." said Michael</p><p>"Thanks for the vote of confidence Michael. But I think right now you and K.I.T.T. should head back home and when I find out K.A.R.R.'s weak spot I will contact you besides you still have to train for the Chunin Exam finales." said Sarah</p><p>"Your right about that. So I guess I will see you later when you contact me about K.A.R.R.'s weak spot when you find it." said Michael</p><p>"You can count on it. So just get going and train and let me and the rest of Knight Industries take care of finding K.A.R.R.'s weak spot." said Sarah</p><p>With that Michael left the room and got inside K.I.T.T. and they head back to the house to rest. The next day Michael had shown up to the training ground where Jiraiya had told him to meet him to train.</p><p>"Well this is the place where Jiraiya told me to meet him for our training. So I wonder where he could be? I just hope he isn't spying on the woman in the hot springs again as I will make sure he will regret it if he is." thought Michael angry</p><p>With that Michael waited by a tree for Jiraiya to show up. After 20 minutes of waiting there was a gust of wind and when it pass standing in front of Michael was Jiraiya who had now just decide to show up for their training.</p><p>"What took you so long Jiraiya? Your late for our training." said Michael in a angry voice</p><p>"Well I am very sorry Michael. But I was busy trying to find information on Orochimaru's plans." replied Jiraiya</p><p>"Well telling from the tone of your voice. You are telling the truth. So what are you going to be teaching me today Jiraiya?" said Michael</p><p>"Well I plan on teaching you a very powerful and forbidden jutsu that will help you in the finals of the Chunin Exams and might come in handy if you face Orochimaru in battle." replied Jiraiya</p><p>"So what kind of jutsu are you going to teach me?" ask Michael curious</p><p>"Well I think it will be better if I showed it to instead of telling you what it is." replied Jiraiya</p><p>With that Jiraiya turn to a tree and put his hands together and a ball of blue light appear in his hands and with a forward motion a beam of blue light shot out and engulf the tree and there was a huge explosion and when the smoke cleared there was now a huge crater where the tree once stood.</p><p>"This jutsu is called the Kamehameha and will damage your opponent depended on how much Chakra you put into it. Now that I showed you how it works. I want you to practice trying to master it until it becomes second nature to you." said Jiraiya</p><p>"As you wish Jiraiya." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael did the same thing Jiraiya to create the Kamehameha but to no success. After three hours of not getting a result. Michael was starting to get angry.</p><p>"I can't believe this I am doing everything that Jiraiya showed me. But I still can't pull off the jutsu. What can I be doing wrong." thought Michael</p><p>Michael decided to try it one more time by putting all his chakra into the jutsu and he was surround in a gold aura and with a burst of chakra a gold beam of light escape from his hands and hit the trees in front of him and when the smoke cleared there was a huge crater where the trees once stood .</p><p>" What the hell just happen?" ask Michael confuse</p><p>"Well telling from the look of things I say you probably took the Kamehameha up to a new level of power. But I highly suggest you don't use it unless it is a life or death situation is that clear Michael." replied Jiraiya looking at him.</p><p>"I understand it very clearly Jiraiya. I will not use this jutsu unless my life or the life's of the people I care about are in danger." said Michael</p><p>"That is good to hear Michael. I think that will be it today for our training. Now just go home and relax and we will train you to master the Kamehameha over the next two weeks." said Jiraiya</p><p>With that Jiraiya left the area and Michael headed for home. Two weeks later it was the day of the finales of the Chunin Exams and up in the stands Sakura and Ino were sitting next to Kyuubi,Ayame,and Anko and looking down at the arena floor at Itachi and Michael who were waiting for the matches to begins.</p><p>"Sakura do you think Michael and Itsachi have a chance to win their matches?" ask Ino worried</p><p>"I know they will Ino. But what worries me is what is going to happen if the two of them have to face each other in a match as I know they don't want to hurt each other." replied Sakura worried</p><p>"Well I wouldn't worry about that Sakura as I know no matter what happens between the two of them it will not change their feelings towards each other like how we all feel towards Michael." said Kyuubi</p><p>"Yeah I know no matter what Michael and Itachi will go all out as that is the way they would want to the other to do if they face each other in a match." said Ayame</p><p>"So don't worry about Michael and Itachi you two as I know they train very hard to reach the finaled like you two have train to become a lot stronger as I can tell you from watching the two of you train over this past month." said Anko smiling</p><p>"Thanks a lot for saying that you three. It sure does help a lot." said Ino</p><p>"Yeah it helps the two of us feel better about what will happen if Michael and Itachi end up fighting each other." said Sakura</p><p>With that they look down towards the arena floor to watch the first match which was between Michael and Neji. Meanwhile up on the top of the arena The Hokage was sitting next to Orochimaru who was disguise as the Kazekage.</p><p>"So what do you think of the ninja that will be in the finales Lord KazeKage?" ask Sarutobi</p><p>"Well from the looks of the ninja this year. I can say that this year's Chunin exams will be very interesting. But I want to know more about this Michael Knight and his metal summon K.I.T.T. ." replied Orochimaru curious</p><p>"Well all you needed to know Lord Kazekage is that any information on Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. is a S rank secret and Is between me and him. " said Sarutobi</p><p>"Well that is to bad to hear Lord Hokage as I wanted to know more about Michael Knight and this K.I.T.T. ." said Orochimaru</p><p>"Well since that is settled Lord Kazekage. How about we watch the matches." said Sarutobi</p><p>"Yes I think that would be a good idea Lord Hokage." said Orochimaru</p><p>With Orochimaru look down to the arena floor well Sarutobi look at Orochimaru.</p><p>"Well go ahead relax Orochimaru since thanks to Kabuto. I know you plan on attacking the village with the sand village and that K.A.R.R. isn't to far away from here. But little that you know that the village is prepared for your little sneak attack and when you decide to spring it then I will be ready to kill you once and for all as I should have when I had the chance in the past. But I willn't make that mistake ever again." thought Sarutobi angry</p><p>With that Sarutobi look down to the arena floor as well. Meanwhile on the arena floor Michael was looking at Neji .</p><p>"So your ready to lose Michael as destiny as foretold I will win this match." said Neji</p><p>"I would not count on that Neji as I plan on making you pay for what you did to Hinata in the preliminaries." replied Michael smiling</p><p>"Then prove it to me Michael Knight." said Neji</p><p>With that said Michael put on his sunglasses and activated his Sharingan while Neji activated his Byakugan.</p><p>"Alright since it appears both of you are ready let the match begin." said the proctor</p><p>With that Michael and Neji charge at each other. Michael quickly made a few handsigns and made about 20 shadow clones each arm with a kuni in their hand and they all attack Neji who use his Byakugan to read the movements of the shadow clones and use his gentle fist to hit each of the clones and make them disappear into clouds of smoke. Neji then went after Michael who tried to avoid Neji's attack using his Sharingan but was not quick enough. Neji then hit Michael right in the chest and sent him flying backwards in a cloud of dust. When the dust cleared where Michael was suppose to be was a solid block of ice that was in the shape of Michael. Neji quickly turn around the arena to see where Michael was hiding.</p><p>"Where the hell could that fool be?" thought Neji angry</p><p>"Right behind you Neji." replied Michael</p><p>Neji turn his head behind him and ended up being hit in the face by Excalibur's blade that sent him flying across the arena floor. When Neji look up he saw Michael staring at him with anger in his eyes.</p><p>"It time to finish this Neji and I know just what to do to make you pay for hurting Hinata." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael bit his thumb and and a drop of blood appeared on it and he went through a series of handsigns and slam his hand to the ground and perform a summoning jutsu and there was a cloud of smoke. When the smoke cleared facing Neji were two dragons the first dragon was blue and white with what look like feather like scales on it's wings and gold eyes and the second dragon was all white with blue eyes and both of them had mouths full of teeth and they were looking right at Neji.</p><p>"Neji I would like you to meet Stardust Dragon and Blue Eyes White Dragon. These dragons come from a place called the Shadow Realm where there other creatures like them called Duel Monsters. You see I happen to come across a contract scroll for these creatures a few years ago and sign it with able me to summon these two dragons and any Duel Monster I want depending on how much chakra I put into it. Now I think it's time to show you how powerful these dragons are. Stardust Dragon and Blue Eyes White Dragon hit Neji here with all your power." said Michael to the two dragons.</p><p>With that the two dragons fired a beam of energy from their mouths that head towards Neji at a fast speed. Neji couldn't do nothing as the beams were coming to fast for him to avoid. When the beams hit Neji there was a explosion of light and when it faded there was a crater in the ground and Neji was in it knock out. The proctor went over to Neji and saw he had pass out.</p><p>"Since Neji is unable to continued the match. The winner is Michael Knight with a knock out blow." said the Proctor</p><p>With that Michael went back to the balcony where the other finalist were waiting for their matches to begin. All of a sudden Michael was hug by Itachi who gave him a kiss on the lips.</p><p>"Michael that had to be the best match I have ever seen." said Itachi</p><p>"Well what do you except Itachi. I made a promise to make Neji pay for what he did to Hinata and I kept it." replied Michael smiling</p><p>With that they look down at the arena floor as the other matches were just beginning . The next match was between the sand ninja Temari and Shikamaru who ended up giving up because he was almost out of chakra to hold Temari in his shadow possesion jutsu and Temari was declared the winner. After the next match that was suppose to between Kankuro and Shino which Kankuro forfeited and Shino was declared the winner it was finally time for Itachi's match against her brother Sasuke and Michael notice she look nervous.</p><p>"Itachi what's wrong?" ask Michael worried</p><p>"It's nothing Michael. It's just that Sasuke has always being better then me at being a ninja and all I ever hear from my parents is how powerful he has become since becoming a ninja. I don't know if I can beat him in this match." replied Itachi sadly</p><p>"I wouldn't worry about Sasuke winning this match as I can tell from all the training you did over the past month that you have becoming even better then your brother and you only have to believe in yourself and I know you will beat him Itachi." said Michael giving her a kiss on the lips to reassure her</p><p>"Thanks a lot for saying that Michael. It sure makes me feel better." said Itachi blushing</p><p>"Don't mention it. Now go down there and show your brother who is the best ninja in the village." said Michael</p><p>With that Itachi leap off the balcony to the arena floor to face her brother in their match with Michael watching her.</p><p>"I know Itachi will win this match. But something tells me that Orochimaru will launch his attack very soon. It's good thing Kabuto told me and the others as well as the Hokage what the signal is that will launch the attack as Orochimaru will be in for a very big surprise when the attack starts. But I have a bad feeling that K.A.R.R. is up to no good and I hope me and K.I.T.T. are ready to face him no matter what he has in store for us." thought Michael</p><p>Meanwhile up in the stands disguise as a Anbu was Kabuto who was ready to give the signal to start the attack on the village.</p><p>"Well I better give the signal as Orochimaru ordered me to. But of course unknow to Orochiamru he does realize that Lord Hokage has the village prepare for the attack since me and Tayuya told him about it and what Orochimaru has plan. I just hope K.A.R.R. isn't around in the area as I know the village isn't prepared to face someone like him." thought Kabuto worried</p><p>With that Kabuto made a series of Handsigns and feathers started to appear in the arena and the crowed started to fall asleep expect for Sakura and the other ninja up in the stands who knew what Orochimaru had plan thanks to Kabuto and Tayuya telling the Hokage who told every ninja in the village to be prepare for Orochimaur's attack. Back on the arena floor Sasuke and Itachi were battling it out neither one giving the other a advantage when both of them saw the feathers in the arena and saw the crowed starting to fall asleep.</p><p>"Looks like that's the signal the Kabuto and Tayuya told us was to signal Orochimaru and his troops to attack the village. I just hope Lord Hokage is going to be alright facing Orochimaru by himself even though Tayuya will be up there with him to step in if Lord Hokage needs help." thought Itachi worried</p><p>Meanwhile up on the top of the arena Sarutobi and Orochimaru were watching was happening to everyone in the arena. Sarutobi then look to Orochimaru who look at the two sand ninja next to him and then out of no where there was a explosion in the area and there was a cloud of smoke. When it cleared there standing in each corner of the area was the sound four including Tayuya and Sarutobi saw he was being held by Orochimaru.</p><p>"Lord Kazekage what is the meaning of this?" ask Sarutobi pretending he didn't know who was holding him.</p><p>"What does it look like Sarutobi Sensei? It's my plan to destroy the Leaf Village once and for all." replied Orochimaur taking off his mask as Sound and Sand ninja started to attack the arena</p><p>"Orochimaru I know it was you all a long under that mask as I knew you were the only one crazy enough to attack the village. But I knew along you plan on attacking the village since one of your ninja told me you plan on doing it and had trick the sand village into helping you. Which is why I had my ninja prepare for your attack." said Sarutobi smiling and getting free of Orochimaru's hold and facing him</p><p>Orochiamru look down to the arena and saw a lot of leaf ninja appear and start to attack his ninja fighting them back.</p><p>"Tell me right now old man which one of my ninja told you of my attack on the village and maybe I might let you live." demanded Orochiamru</p><p>"I will not tell you nothing Orochimaru as I plan on killing you right here and now as I should have done a long time ago." replied Sarutobi</p><p>"Then prove it to me old man as I will make sure you die right here and now along with the leaf village." said Orochimaru</p><p>With that they both charge at each other. Meanwhile on the arena floor Michael was fighting Sand and Sound ninja as well as Itachi with the both of them taking down as many as they could.</p><p>"Itachi are you alright?" ask Michael looking over to Itachi</p><p>"Yeah I am fine Michael. But I can't say the same about these sound and sand ninja. It seems the more we take down the more that keep appearing out of nowhere to attack us." replied Itachi</p><p>"I know what you mean Itachi. But at least it can't get any worse." said Michael</p><p>As soon as Michael said that there was a loud explosion in the wall in front of them and when the smoke cleared there was a giant hole and driving through and stopping in front of them was none other then K.A.R.R. who was facing Michael and Itachi.</p><p>"Well Well Michael Knight it seems you have your hands full with these ninja." said K.A.R.R. with a evil laugh</p><p>"What the hell do you want K.A.R.R. ?" demanded Michael</p><p>"I want to know where K.I.T.T. is right now." replied K.A.R.R.</p><p>"Well K.I.T.T. isn't here right now. But how about I destroy right now by myself." said Michael</p><p>"Like a weak human like you can hope to defeat me. I will ask one more time where is my brother K.I.T.T.?" ask K.A.R.R.</p><p>"I am right here K.A.R.R. ." said K.I.T.T.'s voice</p><p>All of a sudden from out of nowhere K.A.R.R. was hit by missiles that sent him backwards a few feet and when K.A.R.R. look standing in the hole he had made was K.I.T.T. facing him in attack mode.</p><p>"Well looks like you finally decided to show up K.I.T.T. . " said K.A.R.R.</p><p>"I would suggest to you K.A.R.R. give up now or I will make sure the next missile destroys you." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>"I think that would not be a good idea if you did that K.I.T.T. as I have something here that Michael cherishes." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>"What the hell do you mean you have something that I cherish?" ask Michael confuse</p><p>"I think instead of telling you. I will show you instead." replied K.A.R.R.</p><p>With that K.A.R.R. started to change and when the transformation was complete K.A.R.R. was now in his robot mode and in his hands were two girls the same age as Michael. The first girl had long silver hair and eyes and was dress in a orange shirt and blue jeans and white sneakers and the other girl had long golden blond hair that came down to her waist with pink eyes dress in a black shirt and blue jeans and black sneakers.</p><p>"Eve Rio. How can it be possible that the two of them are alive?" said Michael confuse</p><p>Meanwhile up in the stands Sakura and the others who were fighting the ninja as well had seen who K.A.R.R. had in his hands and saw the expression on Michael's face that showed his recognize the two girls that K.A.R.R. held in his hands.</p><p>"This can't be those two are suppose have died three years ago." said Kyuubi shock</p><p>"Kyuubi who are those two girls that K.A.R.R. has?" ask Sakura curious</p><p>"Their names are Rio and Eve and they were the first two girls that Michael feel in love with after he freed me when he met them on a mission with K.I.T.T. to capture some missing ninja when he ended up rescuing them from the missing ninja and brought them back to Knight Industries where they ended up falling in love until three years ago when they went with him and K.I.T.T. on a mission to capture a gang of missing ninja. When they caught up to the ninja there was a big fight and there was huge explosion as one of the ninja set off a very powerful paper bomb. When the smoke cleared Michael look for their bodies but couldn't find them. But Michael still thought they died as he thought no one could have survive a explosion as big as that. After it happen Michael swore that he wouldn't ever fall in love with anyone else but me as he didn't want to lose anyone he loved ever again." said Kyuubi</p><p>"That's sad. But if those two are alive. Then how did K.A.R.R. ended up finding them and holding them hostage?" ask Ino confuse</p><p>"Something tells me Orochimaru somehow found them and held them prisoner and when he reactivated K.A.R.R. K.A.R.R. must have figured out they were contacted to Michael and K.I.T.T. and decide to use them against Michael and K.I.T.T. so he could destroy the both of them." replied Kyuubi</p><p>"That's just low. Using two people that Michael cared about when he was younger just so K.A.R.R. could destroy Michael and K.I.T.T. without them putting up a fight. " said Anko angry</p><p>"I know what you mean Anko. But I know Michael and K.I.T.T. will figure out a way to free both of them." said Kyuubi</p><p>Meanwhile back on the arena floor Michael was looking at K.A.R.R. with a look of pure hate on his face which K.A.R.R. was enjoying.</p><p>"So what will you do now Michael Knight that I have the two most important people in your life in the palm of my hands." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>"I plan on freeing Rio and Eve from you and making you pay for even thinking about trying to use them against me." replied Michael angry</p><p>"I wouldn't make threats Michael Knight as I might decide to end the life's of these two girls right now." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>With that K.A.R.R. started to squeeze Rio and Eve with both of his hands tight.</p><p>"Michael don't worry about us. Just destroy K.A.R.R. ." said Rio</p><p>"Yeah just do what is right and stop K.A.R.R. before he hurts anyone else." said Eve</p><p>Michael watch as K.A.R.R. started to squeeze the life out of Rio and Eve.</p><p>"K.A.R.R. stop it right now. I will do whatever you want just don't hurt them." pleaded Michael with tears in his eyes</p><p>"I am glad you are finally starting to see things my way Michael." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>With that K.A.R.R. ease the pressure on Rio and Eve who caught a breath of air.</p><p>"Now that we understand each other. I want you and K.I.T.T. to meet me near the Forest of Death with in ten minutes and fight me to the death and of course I want the Original K.I.T.T. there as well. If you mange to do this and beat me. Then I will let these two girls go with no problems." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>With that K.A.R.R. transform back into his car mode and look at Michael and K.I.T.T. one more time.</p><p>"Do as I say Michael Knight and don't bring anyone else with you or you will regret not following my orders as I will kill these two girls with my bare hands. You have ten minutes to show up." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>With that K.A.R.R. drove away leaving Michael and K.I.T.T. alone with Itachi.</p><p>"Michael what are we going to do?" ask K.I.T.T.</p><p>"We will do as K.A.R.R. says as I don't want to lose Rio and Eve a second time. So contact Sarah and Viper and tell them to met us near the Forest of Death and tell them what the situation is." replied Michael</p><p>"As you wish Michael." said K.I.T.T. quickly contacting Sarah and Viper and told them what was going on with K.A.R.R.</p><p>"Michael you and K.I.T.T. can't go and face K.A.R.R. by yourselfs as he is to powerful for you two alone." said Itachi</p><p>"I know that Itachi. But he has Rio and Eve hostage and I can't let them die by his hand as I can't afford to lose them a second time as I can't stand to lose you and the others. So just stay here and hold back any Sound and Sand ninja that try to attack while me and K.I.T.T. will go after K.A.R.R. and save Rio and Eve and I promise I will come back and all of us can live a peaceful life." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael got inside K.I.T.T. and they drove off towards the Forest of Death to met K.A.R.R. and save Rio and Eve leaving Itachi standing there with tears in her eyes as they drove off. Meanwhile on top of the Arena Sarutobi was having a hard time fighting Orochimaru who had mange to summon the first and second Hokage's to fight him which Sarutobi was holding them back with King Enma in his bo form.</p><p>"This is getting me no where. I have tried everything to defeat The first and second Hokage. I guess there is only one thing left to do." said Sarutobi</p><p>"Don't tell me Sarutobi you plan on using that Jutsu?" ask Enam shock</p><p>"Yes my friend I have to use the jutsu that the fourth Hokage taught me. At least this way I can correct the mistake I made by letting Orochimaru live when I should have killed him all those year ago when I had the chance." replied Sarutobi</p><p>"Then I wish you the best of luck my friend and I hope you take Orochimaru with you when you die." said Enma</p><p>"I plan on it my friend." said Sarutobi</p><p>With that Sarutobi made a few handsigns and made two shadow clones and then he made some more handsigns and a ghost like figured appear over him.</p><p>"Good thanks to this jutsu I am the only one that can see the shingami with means Orochimaru will not expect me attack." thought Sarutobi smiling</p><p>"What are you smiling for Sarutobi Sensei? As you are going to die right here in front of me." ask Orochimaru smiling</p><p>"You are mistaking Orochimaru for it is you that will be the one who dies here." replied Sarutobi</p><p>"Then show me you old geezer." said Orochimaru</p><p>With that the first and second hokage attack Sarutobi and all Sarutobi two shadow clones grab a hold of the first and second hokage and the Shinigami reach out his arms through the shadow clones and into the bodies of the first and second hokage and pulled out their souls as their bodies started to crumble apart and Orochimaur had a look of pure shock on his face.</p><p>"What the hell just happen?" ask Orochimaru getting scared</p><p>"That would be the jutsu that the fourth Hokage use to seal the Kyuubi into his own son to save the village and now I plan on using it to kill you but of course I have to give up my own life in order to use this jutsu." replied Sarutobi smiling</p><p>"You aren't going to use that jutsu you on me you old fool as I will not give you the chance to grab me." said Orochimaru</p><p>"I would be wrong about that Orochiamaru." said Tayuya's voice</p><p>All of a sudden Orochimaru felt himself being held by two pairs of hands and saw that Tayuya and Kabuto were holding on to him making sure he couldn't move a muscle.</p><p>"Kabuto Tayuya what is the meaning of this?" demanded Orochimaru angry</p><p>"It's called us betraying you Orochimaru." replied Tayuya</p><p>"Yeah were here to make sure that Lord Hokage kills you before you can hurt anymore innocent people. Telling from the look on your face. I am guessing your surprise that me and Tayuya have decide to betray you. But here's a fact you didn't know Orochimaru me and Tayuya have been working as double agents for the past 4 years with Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. to make sure you didn't harm any more innocent people and we know you were the one who reactivated K.A.R.R. as I told Michael since the beginning of the Chunin Exams and I was the one who told the Hokage about your attack on the village." said Kabuto smiling</p><p>"I can't believe this being betrayed by two of my best ninja. I should have listen to that pile of scrap metal K.A.R.R. when he told me that you two were going to betrayed me. If I get out of this I will make sure the two of you pay for your betrayal." shouted Orochuimaru with venom in his voice</p><p>"I wouldn't count on that Orochiamru as it will be you who dies here today." said Sarutobi walking over to him</p><p>With that Sarutobi grab a hold of Orochimaru and Orochimaru could see the Shinigami hand reach into his body and started to pull out his soul. Orochimaru started to fight Sarutobi to keep his soul from being eaten by the shinigami as Sarutobi tried his best to pull out Orochimaru's soul with all his strength . After 10 minutes of trying to pull out Orochimaru's soul Sarutobi could feel his body started to weaken and realize he couldn't pull out Orochimaru's soul.</p><p>"I can't believe this It seems my body is to weak to pull out Orochimaru's soul and I am so close to doing it." thought Sarutobi angry</p><p>Orochimaru look at Sarutobi and could tell that his body was starting to give in as his soul was starting to retreat back into his body.</p><p>"Well looks like you don't have the strength old man to finish me off. Which means I win and when I get free from you I will kill the two traitors here who help you." said Orochimaru smiling</p><p>"I my not be able to take you with me to my death. But I can still take away all your jutsu you have acquired." replied Sarutobi in a weak voice</p><p>All of a sudden Sarutobi took out a kuni and slice the piece of Orochimaur's soul that was still sticking out and it was then eaten by the shinigami and Orochimaru could feel his arms starting to feel numb and not able to move.</p><p>"What the hell did you do to me you old geezer?" demanded Orochimaru</p><p>"I have taken away all your jutsu Orochimaru and your arms are now useless you will never be able to make a another handsign forever." replied Sarutobi in a weak voice</p><p>With that Orochimaru saw Kabuto and Tayuya standing over the Hokage and look at him with killing intent in their eyes.</p><p>"You may have taken my jutsu away old man. But that will not stop my from reaching my goal of immortality and when I do reach it then I will make sure you two traitors pay for ever betraying me and I will destroy this village once and for all." said Orochimaru angry.</p><p>With that Orochimaru disappeared in a cloud of smoke as did the ninja in the arena as well. Kabuto and Tayuya look at Sarutobi and saw that he was now dead and both were thinking how they were going to break the news to Michael when he return. Meanwhile outside the Forest of Death Michael and K.I.T.T. had finally reach the area where K.A.R.R. told them to meet him and both of them saw K.A.R.R. standing still with both of his windows down and Michael could see Rio and Eve strap into K.A.R.R.'s seats tight and both of them look very scared but otherwise alright.</p><p>"Well good to see the two of you could finally make it here on time. But where is the Original K.I.T.T. as I want to destroy him as well." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>"I am right here K.A.R.R.." replied Viper as he appeared next to K.I.T.T. in his defender mode with his rocket launcher pointed at K.A.R.R. ready to fire</p><p>"Well I am glad you decide to finally show yourself you weakling." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>"Enough talking K.A.R.R. we are all here. So just let Rio and Eve go so we can start this fight already." said Michael</p><p>"I don't think so Michael Knight as I think I will keep these two as insurance that you don't pull anything fast. Besides I want to know right now who is behind the wheel of the original K.I.T.T. as it has bugging me since he showed up." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>"That would be me K.A.R.R. ." said Sarah sticking her head out the door of Viper</p><p>"Well this is a surprise. I didn't expect the person behind the wheel of the Original K.I.T.T. to be Sarah Graiman the daughter of the man who built me. This is even better then I plan as I can take my revenge on the daughter of Charles Graimen as well." said K.A.R.R. with a evil laugh</p><p>"Enough talking K.A.R.R. lets get this over with as I plan on rescuing Rio and Eve from you and destroy you once and for all." said Michael</p><p>"I agree with you Michael Knight. The time for talking is over and the time for me to destroy all of you as begun." said K.A.R.R.</p><p>With that K.A.R.R transform into Attack mode and charge them. K.I.T.T quickly responded by transforming into attack mode as well and avoided K.A.R.R. missiles as K.A.R.R. came towards them while Viper fired a few harmless rockets towards K.A.R.R. as they did not want to hurt Rio and Eve as the two girls were inside of K.A.R.R. . K.A.R.R. quickly avoided the rockets and fired a barrage of missiles at K.I.T.T. and Viper that ended up hitting the both of them and sent the two of them flying backwards and then K.A.R.R. fired his laser at the two of them and both K.I.T.T. and Viper took a lot of damage.</p><p>"K.I.T.T. damage report?" ask Michael</p><p>"We have lose most of our weapons systems as well as the repair systems with are offline for the next 20 minutes." replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Sarah what is the status on Viper?' ask Michael</p><p>"Viper has the same damage as K.I.T.T. has taken and it will be a few minutes before I have Viper's repair systems online again." replied Sarah</p><p>"That's not good. We need to stop K.A.R.R. right now before he finishes us off. But we can't destroy him without killing Rio and Eve in the process." said Michael slamming his fist on K.I.T.T.'s dashboard</p><p>"I might have a idea on how we can stop K.A.R.R. for a few minutes while we me and Viper can get our repair systems back online and allow you to save Rio and Eve from him since what I have plan will take K.A.R.R. offline for about 10 minutes." suggested K.I.T.T.</p><p>"I am all ears K.I.T.T. . What is this plan of yours?" ask Michael curious</p><p>"While me E.M.P. Isn't offline and I am thinking we can use it to make K.A.R.R. go offline for the next 10 minutes giving you enough time to save Rio and Eve and allowing me and Viper to get our repair systems back online." replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>"That's sounds like a good plan K.I.T.T. . But there is one problem with that." said Sarah</p><p>"What would that be?" ask Michael</p><p>"Well you see both Viper and K.I.T.T. were design to make E.M.P. useless on the both of them as it is on K.A.R.R. as well. Which means K.I.T.T.'s E.M.P. would not affect K.A.R.R. at all." replied Sarah in a sad tone</p><p>"That would be true Sarah. But what I plan is to have Michael infuse my E.M.P. with his chakra which would be powerful enough to knock K.A.R.R. offline for 10 minutes." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>"You mean to tell us I infuse your E.M.P. using my chakra?" ask Michael shock</p><p>"Yes but we have better hurry as it appears K.A.R.R. is starting to head towards us with the intent to end our life's ." replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Alright K.I.T.T. I will do as you say as you have never steer me wrong before in my life." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael started to gather his chakra together and infuse K.I.T.T. with it. At that moment K.A.R.R. had stop in front of K.I.T.T. and Viper with all his weapons aim at them ready to finish them off once and for all.</p><p>"Do any of you have any last words before I kill all of you?" ask K.A.R.R. in a evil voice</p><p>"Yeah I do K.A.R.R. . K..I.T.T. Release the E.M.P. now." shouted Michael</p><p>With that K.I.T.T. release his E.M.P. infuse with Michael's chakra and fired it at K.A.R.R. which hit him and before K.A.R.R. knew what happen he was offline from the blast.</p><p>"Michael K.A.R.R. is offline. Now is your chance to rescue Rio and Eve from him." said K.I.T.T.</p><p>"You got it K.I.T.T. ." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael quickly got out of K.I.T.T. and ran over to the now offline K.A.R.R. and open the passenger side door and quickly undid the straps that were holding Rio and Eve and quickly got them out of K.A.R.R. and both girls look at him.</p><p>"Michael we knew you would save us from K.A.R.R. ." said Rio</p><p>"Yeah we thought we would never see you again." said Eve</p><p>"I am glad to see the both of you again after all these years. But K.A.R.R. will come back online any minutes now and I want you ran and hide as far away as possible before he does." said Michael</p><p>"Whatever you say Michael." said Rio</p><p>With that Rio and Eve quickly ran over to the trees about 10 yards away and hid. Once Michael saw that the two of them were safe he started to run back over to K.I.T.T. when all of a sudden he was stop by K.A.R.R. who was now back online and in his robot mode with his machine guns pointed at Michael.</p><p>"Smart move Michael Knight using K.I.T.T.'s E.M.P. infuse with your chakra to knock me offline so you could rescue Rio and Eve from me. But now that I am back online. I have you where I want you and there isn't nothing that will stop me from killing you." said K.A.R.R. angry</p><p>With that K.A.R.R. was ready to fire his machine guns at Michael when all of a sudden K.A.R.R. was hit by a barrage of missiles that sent him flying backwards about 30 feet and when he got back to his feet he saw K.I.T.T. and Viper fully repaired and with their weapons lock on to him ready to destroy him.</p><p>"Give up K.A.R.R. you lost this time." said Viper</p><p>"So are you ready to be destroy once and for all K.A.R.R.?" ask K.I.T.T. aiming his weapons at K.A.R.R.</p><p>"I will tell you this to you both. You may have surprise me with that E.M.P. Infuse with chakra. But you will not destroy me today or any other day as I promise I will destroy destroy all of you and Knight Industries once and for all and I will rule this world with the humans as my slaves and with machines like myself ruling over them with me. But until that day comes. I will continued to live and the next time we face each other I will destroy the both of you along with Sarah Graiman and Michael Knight." replied K.A.R.R. with venom in his voice</p><p>With that K.A.R.R. fired his machine guns and missiles and was covered in a cloud of smoke. When it cleared K.A.R.R. had vanish once again.</p><p>"Looks like K.A.R.R. got away again." said Michael</p><p>"Yes but next time we will destroy him once and for all for my father's sake." said Sarah</p><p>All of a sudden Rio and Eve came out of nowhere and tackled Michael to the ground.</p><p>"Michael you and K.I.T.T. totally sent K.A.R.R. packing ." said Rio</p><p>"Yeah you taught that machine a lesson about messing with you and K.I.T.T. ." added Eve</p><p>"Thanks you two. But do you think you can let me up now as you are holding me to the ground." said Michael</p><p>With that Rio and Eve got off of Michael and let him get back on his feet.</p><p>"So what do we do now?" ask Michael curious</p><p>"Well I think you and K.I.T.T. should bring Rio and Eve here back to the village as I have the feeling something bad just happen to the Hokage and me and Viper will head back to Knight Industries and try to find a weak spot in K.A.R.R.'s design that we can use to destroy him once and for all." replied Sarah</p><p>"That sounds like a plan Sarah. Let me know if you and Viper find anything." said Michael</p><p>"We will Michael." said Viper</p><p>With that Sarah got inside of Viper and they headed back to Knight Industries while Michael had K.I.T.T. transform into a S.U.V. and he,Rio,and Eve got inside K.I.T.T. and headed back to the village. Once they got back to the village Michael found out from Kabuto that Sarutobi had died trying to kill Orochimaru but was only able to take away all of Orochiamru's jutsu. When Michael heard that he fell to his knees and started to cry as Sarutobi was one of the first people who had cared about him since he was born and Sakure hug Michael trying to comfort him. When Michael stop crying and got back to his feet Anko told him that the funeral would be in a week. With that they all headed back to their homes to prepare for the Hokage's funeral. One week later and it was the day of the Hokage's funeral and Michael was in his house with the girls he loved all dress in black ready to head for the funeral to pay their respect to the Hokage.</p><p>"I can't believe that Lord Hokage is dead." said Sakura</p><p>"Yeah I know what you mean. It seems impossible that someone like him could have died." said Itachi</p><p>"How come the Hokage had to die when he didn't deserve to?" ask Ino starting to cry</p><p>"I know what you are feeling Ino. But we have to remember that the Hokage gave his life to make sure the village was safe from people like Orochimaru." said Anko</p><p>"Anko is right Ino. The Hokage was the most bravest and honorable person I have ever met as was the Fourth Hokage." said Kyuubi</p><p>"So what do we do now?" ask Rio</p><p>"We will go to the funeral and pay our respects to Lord Hokage as it would mean a lot to him for us to be there." replied Michael</p><p>"So are you going to be alright Michael as it seem you took the death of the Hokage real hard?" ask Eve concern</p><p>"I will be aright Eve. But it will take time for me to get over losing the Hokage as he was like a grandfather to me." replied Michael</p><p>With that they all headed out the door and headed towards the funeral along with K.I.T.T. who followed behind them at a slow speed. Once they reach the funeral they could see all the ninja of the village had come to pay their respect to the Hokage. As they were standing there Michael saw Konohamaru cried over the lost of his grandfather and Iruka put his hands on him and said a few words to comfort him. One by one each ninja went to the coffin with the Hokage's picture on it and said a few words. After awhile it was finally Michael's turn and when he got to the coffin he decided to say something.</p><p>"I want to say to everyone here that the Hokage was the most caring and bravest person I have ever meant in my life. He gave his life for this village without thinking about himself as he cared about everyone living in the village and for that I am glad I got to know him as he was a person you could look up to and count on to give their life for you. So if you can hear me Lord Hokage. I just want you to know that you have made everyone in this village stronger by giving up your life for them and that we will never forget you forever." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael put his flower on th coffin and walk away with tears coming down his face as he did so and he swore that Orochimaru and K.A.R.R. would pay for attacking the village and making the Hokage give up his life and that was a promise he attained to keep no matter what.</p><p>That's keep for this chapter.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>Stranded Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto
or Knight Rider. Naruto is own by Masashi Kishimoto and Knight Rider
is own by NBC. I don't make money off this story.</P><P><U>Three Months Later.</U></P><P>It now had been
three months since Orochimaru's attack on the village and the Third
Hokage had died protecting the village. During that time Michael's
mom Tsunade had come with Shizune and had become the new Hokage since
Jiraiya had talk the counsel into making Tsunade the Hokage since the
village needed one to help start the rebuilding of the village and a
month after that happen Michael had gotten married to his eight
girlfriends and they had all moved into his parents house and Michael
had been working nonstop with K.I.T.T. to prepare for when K.A.R.R.
decided to attack them again in order to destroy the both of them.
Right now Michael was outside his house working on K.I.T.T.'s
weapon's systems to make sure everything was ready for the next time
they face K.A.R.R. .</P><P>"So K.I.T.T.
how are things looking with the weapon system's so far?" ask
Michael</P><P>"Everything so
far is looking fine according to my scans Michael." replied
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"That's good
to hear partner as we need to make sure everyone of your systems are
working the next time we face K.A.R.R. in battle as I have a feeling
it will not be long before he makes his next move." said Michael</P><P>"Michael what
are you doing?" ask Kyuubi's voice</P><P>Michael look up
and saw Kyuubi and his other wives standing out in the front of the
house looking at him with looks of concern on their faces.</P><P>"I am just
working on K.I.T.T.'s weapon systems to make sure they are ready for
the next time we face K.A.R.R. ." replied Michael</P><P>"Well I am
sure everyone of K.I.T.T.'s systems are working just fine Michael
since you keep working on them day and night like for the past three
months." said Anko</P><P>"Well Anko I
can never be to careful when it comes to K.A.R.R. since he has slip
past me and K.I.T.T. twice and I don't want to make it a third time."
said Michael</P><P>"Well knowing
you and K.I.T.T. I am sure you will be able to take down K.A.R.R.
once and for all." said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah you and
K.I.T.T. will destroy K.A.R.R. the next time you fight him." added
Ayame</P><P>"Well thanks for the support you two. But something
tells me you eight aren't just here to see how things are going with
me and K.I.T.T. . " said Michael</P><P>"You would be
correct there Michael. As we all came to tell you something
important." said Itachi</P><P>"So what is it
you eight have to tell me that is important?" ask Michael curious</P><P>"Well do you
remember our wedding night and how you made love to all of us."
said Ino</P><P>"Yeah I
remember that happening that day was the happiest day in my life."
said Michael thinking back to that day.</P><P>"Well you see
Michael six weeks after that we all started to came down with a bad
case of morning sickness and we all had Lady Tsunade check us out to
see what was wrong with the eight of us." said Rio</P><P>"So what did
my mom find out that was wrong you the eight of you?" ask Michael
figuring out where this was all going to go</P><P>"Well she
found out the eight of us are pregnant with your kids and we all
decided to tell you the good news that you are going to be a father.
We hope you are not angry with the news." replied Eve</P><P>"Why would I
be angry with the eight of you. That is the best news I ever heard in
my life. So I am going to be a dad." said Michael giving each of
them a kiss on the lips.</P><P>"Well we are
glad you are happy with the news as we all are." said Kyuubi</P><P>All of sudden
there was a beeping noise coming from K.I.T.T. .</P><P>"Michael I
hate to break up the celebration but I am receiving a message from
Sarah and it sounds urgent from the sound of it." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Okay K.I.T.T.
patch her through." said Michael</P><P>With that
K.I.T.T. opened up the line to Sarah and she appeared on K.I.T.T.'s
screen.</P><P>"Michael I am
glad I finally got through to you." said Sarah</P><P>"Well I am
glad you did as K.I.T.T. said you had something urgent that you
wanted to talk about from the sound of it. So what is it you have to
tell me?" ask Michael</P><P>"Well I have
good news to tell you and K.I.T.T. . I have finally found a weak spot
in K.A.R.R.'s design that you and K.I.T.T. can use to destroy
K.A.R.R. once and for all." replied Sarah</P><P>"That is good
news to hear. So can you tell me and K.I.T.T. anything about
K.A.R.R.'s weak spot we can use to destroy him once and for all?"
ask Michael curious</P><P>"Yes I do
Michael. But I prefer to tell you in person since it we can be sure
that K.A.R.R. doesn't overhear this using his jamming signal to
listen in. So how about we talk about it over in the Hokage's tower
in your mom's office as I know it will be the safest place to tell
you as I know you don't want to leave the village unprotected."
replied Sarah</P><P>"That sounds
like a good idea. I will meet you there in 10 minutes so you can tell
me all about K.A.R.R.'s weakness." said Michael</P><P>"You got it
Michael. I will see you there in 10 minutes." said Sarah</P><P>With that Sarah
cut off the transmission and the screen went blank.</P><P>"Me and
K.I.T.T. have to head to the Hokage's tower so Grandma Sarah can tell
me more about K.A.R.R.'s weakness that me and K.I.T.T. can use to
destroy K.A.R.R. once and for all. " said Michael</P><P>"We understand
Michael since K.A.R.R. posses a threat to the village and the world
as long as he is still alive." said Sakura</P><P>"So you and
K.I.T.T. should head to the Hokage's tower to see what K.A.R.R.'s
weakness from Sarah as it could help you two defeat K.A.R.R. once and
for all." said Itachi</P><P>"Thanks you
and I promise after K.. Has been destroyed for good. We can all
settled down and spend some time together. That is a promise I attain
to keep to you eight." said Michael</P><P>With that
Michael gave each of his wives a kiss on the lips and he got inside
K.I.T.T. and they drove off towards the Hokage tower to see what
Sarah had found out about K.A.R.R.'s weakness. Meanwhile far away
inside of Orochimaru's lair Orochimaru was sitting down and in pain
from the jutsu that the Third Hokage had use to take away all his
jutsu three months ago.</P><P>"I can't
believe that old geezer took away all my jutsu and the fact that
Kabuto and Tayuya were working with Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. for
the past four years as double agents. I swear if I ever get my arms
healed I will make those two pay for ever betraying me in the first
place." said Orochimaru with venom in his voice</P><P>"Well I warn
you before about those two Orochimaru but you decide not to listen to
me and now look at you." said K.A.R.R. who was behind Orochimaru</P><P>"Don't you
dare mock me you stupid piece of scrap metal. If it wasn't for me you
would still be shut down in that room deep underground where I found
you. So I suggest you just shut up and leave me be." said
Orochimaru</P><P>All of a sudden
K.A.R.R. transform into his robot mode and grab Orochimaru in his
hand and started to squeeze tight.</P><P>"What the hell
do you think you are doing K.A.R.R. ?" ask Orochimaru breathing
hard</P><P>"What I am
doing is getting rid of you once and for all Orochimaru as I told you
before you would pay dearly for Kabuto and Tayuya betrayal if it
happen and I decided now is a good time for you to pay with your
life." replied K.A.R.R. squeezing tighter</P><P>"You can't do
this to me K.A.R.R. . You still need me to help you defeat Michael
Knight and K.I.T.T. and you promise to help me with my goal of
immortality like you promise me." said Orochimaru</P><P>"You weak
human fool you are no longer useful to me as I can defeat Michael
Knight and K.I.T.T. by myself and I only told you I could help you
reach immortality as I decided it would help me trick you into
working with me. Now I think it time for you to die Orochimaru as you
have outlive your usefulness to me long enough." said K.A.R.R. in a
evil tone</P><P>"With that
K.A.R.R. pointed his machine guns at Orochimaru and fired them
putting many bullets into Orochimaru and crushing every bone in his
body until he was dead. Once K.A.R.R.'s scanners told him that
Orochimaru was no longer alive. He let go of Orochimaru's body and
let it drop to the ground now lifeless.</P><P>"Now that I
have dealt with Orochimaru.I can now focus on my plan to destroy
Michael Knight and both K.I.T.T.'s as well as Sarah Graimen and
Knight Industries once and for all. And once they are all out of my
way then I can proceed with my plan to take over this world and make
the humans build machines like me and we will rule over them as I
will prove to Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. that machines are far
superior to humans." said K.A.R.R.</P><P>With that
K.A.R.R. transform back into his car mode and took off to put his
plan to destroy Michael Knight and K.I.T.T. into action. Meanwhile in
the Hokage's office Tsunade was waiting with Sarah for Michael to
show up when all of the sudden the door open and Michael came in the
office.</P><P>"Michael good
to see you could make it." said Tsunade to her son</P><P>"Well mom when
Grnadma Sarah told me that see she found a weak spot in K.A.R.R.'s
design me and K.I.T.T. rush over as soon as we could to her what she
found out." replied Michael</P><P>"Well I am
glad you could come Michael as what I have to tell you is very good
news as it will allow you and K.I.T.T. to take down K.A.R.R. once and
for all." said Sarah</P><P>"So care to
tell me about K.A.R.R.'s weak spot and how me and K.I.T.T. can use it
to destroy him once and for all?" ask Michael</P><P>"Oh course
Michael. I have been going over K.A.R.R.'s blueprints over ever since
K.A.R.R. reappeared nonstop and yesterday I finally found K.A.R.R.'s
weak spot and it was staring me right in the face the entire time.
You see there is a flaw in K.A.R.R.'s cockpit when he is in robot
mode and in his car mode that is very weak in design from the rest of
his body." replied Sarah</P><P>"I can
understand that. But how is this going to help me and K.I.T.T. in
destroying K.A.R.R. for good?" ask Michael confuse</P><P>"Well I am
thinking if you use K.I.T.T.'s turbo boost at the right time and in
the right place when you hit K.A.R.R. dead on he should be destroyed
right away from that one flaw in his design as it was never fixed and
that means you and K.I.T.T. should be able to take him out for good."
replied Sarah</P><P>"Well that
sound like a good plan. But what we don't know is when K.A.R.R. will
make his move and attack me and K.I.T.T. and the fact he is working
with Orochimaru which makes it even worse." said Michael</P><P>"I don't think
Orochimaru isn't going to be much of a problem Michael as he can't
use any jutsu anymore and I am thinking K.A.R.R. see Orochimaru as
useless and probably plan on killing him since it appears that
K.A.R.R. has had enough of Orochimaru failing to destroy the
villlage. So it probably will not be to long before K.A.R.R. makes
his move and when he does it will be his last as you and K.I.T.T.
will be able to take him out once and for all since you now know his
weakness and he doesn't know that you do." replied Tsunade</P><P>"So until
K.A.R.R. decides to show himself. All I can suggest is you and
K.I.T.T. relax and spend time at home and be prepared for when he
decides to attack the village which he will probably do knowing him."
said Sarah</P><P>"I guess you
are both right and besides I think I allow it to myself to spend time
with my wives as much as possible since I have the feeling K.A.R.R.
will not go peacefully when me and K.I.T.T. destroy him for good."
said Michael</P><P>"Good now I
think you should head home with K.I.T.T. as I know your wives must be
worried sick about you." said Tsunade</P><P>"Yeah your
right mom I should go home as Kyuubi and the others are wondering
what is taking me and K.I.T.T. so long to get back from seeing you
and Grnadma Sarah. So I will see you two later." said Michael</P><P>With that
Michael left the office and when he got outside he got inside of
K.I.T.T. and they headed back home to spend time with the others.
Once they got to the house Michael got out of K.I.T.T. and went
inside to see Kyuubi and the other sitting at the table with dinner
already made.</P><P>"Michael you
finally back." said Kyuubi as she and the others had notice Michael
walk into the house.</P><P>"Yeah I am and
I am sorry that me and K.I.T.T. kept you eight waiting for us to
return." said Michael</P><P>"That's okay
Michael as what Sarah had to tell you was important since it meant
you and K.I.T.T. would be able to destroy K.A.R.R. once and for all."
said Anko</P><P>"So what did
Sarah tell you about K.A.R.R.' s weakness?" ask Ayame curious</P><P>"Well she told
me that she found a flaw in K.A.R.R.'s cockpit in his robot and car
mode that is extremely weak that me and K.I.T.T. could use against
him the next time me and K.I.T.T. face him ." replied Michael</P><P>"Well I ave no
doubt in my mind you and K.I.T.T. will defeat K.A.R.R. once and for
all." said Sakura</P><P>"You two are
the best team there is in the world." added Ino</P><P>"Thanks for
the support as I think me and K.I.T.T. will need it when K.A.R.R.
decides to show himself." said Michael</P><P>"Well don't
worry about it to much Michael as you need to relax for a little
while." said Itachi</P><P>"Besides you
owe it to us to spend some time with the eight of us." said Rio</P><P>"Well I do owe
it to spend some time with your eight as I have spent the last three
months working on K.I.T.T.'s systems nonstop." said Michael</P><P>"Well that is
good to hear Michael as we need do need to spend more time together
as we will not be able to when K.A.R.R. decides to make his move."
said Eve</P><P>With that
Michael sat down at the table and they all ate their dinner. After
they finish eating and clean up they decide it was time to get some
rest as they would need it since they didn't know when K.A.R.R. would
show up. With that they all headed upstairs and went to bed. Later
that night Michael couldn't sleep as he couldn't stop worrying about
what K.A.R.R. had plan and decided to go outside to clear his head.
With that Michael got out of bed and went downstairs and went out the
front door to the front of the house and sat down on the porch and
look up at the night sky to clear his head.</P><P>"Michael what
are you doing up this late?" ask K.I.T.T. who had saw Michael come
out the door</P><P>"Well K.I.T.T.
I couldn't sleep very well so I decided to come out are to get some
fresh air and clear my head." replied Michael</P><P>"So your still
worried about what K.A.R.R. as plan. Am I correct?" said K.I.T.T.
figuring out why Michael couldn't sleep</P><P>"Yeah I am
K.I.T.T. . I don't why but I have a bad feeling that K.A.R.R. is up
to no good and has something plan for the village. I just hope
whatever K.A.R.R. plan is we can stop him for good." said Michael</P><P>"I wouldn't
worry to much Michael as I know we will destroy K.A.R.R. once and for
all and once that happens everyone can live in peace without worrying
about someone as evil as K.A.R.R. harming innocent people." said
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"I guess you
are right K.I.T.T. . Once we destroy K.A.R.R. we don't have to worry
about him ever again." said Michael feeling a little better</P><P>"That's good
to hear Michael. Now I think you should head back to bed and get some
sleep as you will needed when K.A.R.R. decides to show himself to
us." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Your right as
always K.I.T.T. . I will head back to bed and get some rest and
thanks for the pep talk." said Michael getting to his feet</P><P>"Your welcome
Michael." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that
Michael went back inside the house to get some sleep as he knew he
would need all his strength for when K.A.R.R. decided to attack. The
next day Michael was in the forest outside the village on patrol
looking for any sign of trouble while K.I.T.T. had decided to search
the other side of the forest to patrol as well looking out for any
danger. Michael was starting to get bored of keeping a eye out for
danger as nothing had happen so far and it was starting to make him
worried.</P><P>"Man so far
there hasn't been a sign of any enemy ninja or K.A.R.R. anywhere and
things in this forest are to quiet. I just hope I don't run into
K.A.R.R. since I don't have K.I.T.T. with me as I know I can't take
him on by myself." thought Michael worried</P><P>All of a sudden
from out of nowhere Michael saw a barrage of kuni come out from the
trees and headed straight towards him. Michael quickly dodge the kuni
just in the nick of time and quickly took out Excalibur and look to
see who was the one who threw the kuni. All of a sudden a ninja leap
out of the tree where the kuni had come from and Michael saw that it
was male ninja about 20 years old with black hair and eyes wearing
gray pants and a shirt and had the sound village headband on his
forehead.</P><P>"Well looks
like you mange to avoid my attack Michael Knight." said the ninja</P><P>"Well I
couldn't let you kill me before I had the chance to ask you why you
are here outside the village gates alone." replied Michael</P><P>"I came here
to deliver a message from Lord K.A.R.R. ." said the ninja</P><P>"So you work
for K.A.R.R. now. So what happen to your leader Orochimaru ?" ask
Michael</P><P>"Lord
Orochimaru was to weak to lead us which is why K.A.R.R. killed him
and told me and the others if we follow his orders then he would gave
us power beyond what Orochimaru could ever dream of." replied the
ninja</P><P>"Well I hate
to tell you but K.A.R.R. can't be trusted as he doesn't care about
anyone but himself." said Michael</P><P>"Your lying
you fool. K.A.R.R. would never lie to us like Orochimaru did." said
the ninja</P><P>"Fine have it
your way. So what is the message you have from K.A.R.R.? " ask
Michael</P><P>"Well Lord
K.A.R.R. wants you and K.I.T.T. to meet him for a final battle to the
death at Training ground seven and he only wants you two to come
alone or else you will be very sorry if you don't follow his orders."
replied the ninja smiling</P><P>"Well all I
can say to that is that K.A.R.R. is going to go down once and for all
and I will make sure you and the rest of the sound village go down
with him." said Michael</P><P>"Well since
you put it that way. I guess I will kill you right here and let Lord
K.A.R.R. take care of your friend K.I.T.T. and I will just tell him
you refuse to do as he said." said the ninja taking out a kuni</P><P>"Well your not
killing to me today as it will be you who dies here today." said
Michael pointing Excalibur at the ninja</P><P>"Like to see
you try you fool." said the ninja</P><P>With that said
the ninja charge at Michael with the intent to kill him. Michael
quickly use Excalibur power to blind the ninja and avoid his attack
and cut the ninja across the chest with Excalibur. When the ninja
recovered from the flash of light cause by Excalibur he look at
Michael and saw a ball of gold light appear in his hands and before
he could do anything a beam of gold light shot out of Michael hands
and headed straight towards the ninja and hit him. When the beam hit
the ninja there was a huge explosion and a cloud of dust. When the
dust cleared there was a huge crater where the ninja once was and
there was no sign of him anywhere.</P><P>"Looks like
that took care of him." thought Michael smiling</P><P>All of a sudden
Michael heard a sound of a engine and look to see K.I.T.T. coming
over to him as he had heard the sound of the explosion and had come
to check on Michael.</P><P>"Michael are
you alright?" ask K.I.T.T. concern</P><P>"Yeah I am
just fine K.I.T.T. . But we better head to training ground seven as
K.A.R.R. is waiting there for us to show up. So contact Madara and
Sarah and tell them what is going on ." replied Michael</P><P>"As you wish
Michael." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that 
Michael got inside of K.I.T.T. and they headed towards training
ground seven as K.I.T.T. contacted Sarah and Madara to tell them what
was going on with K.A.R.R. . Meanwhile at training ground seven
K.A.R.R. was waiting with two sound ninja waiting for Michael and
K.I.T.T. as he knew Michael had gotten his message and would come
alone with K.I.T.T. like he had plan since he knew they wanted to end
this battle against him once and for all. After 10 minutes of waiting
K.A.R.R. heard a sound of a engine and saw K.I.T.T. driving into the
training ground and stop about 50 feet away in front of him and
Michael got out of K.I.T.T. and look at K.A.R.R. with a angry look on
his face.</P><P>"Well well. I
am glad you and K.I.T.T. had decided to show up alone like I wanted
Michael Knight. I do hope the ninja I sent to give you my message
didn't gave you to much trouble." said K.A.R.R. in a evil voice</P><P>"I wouldn't
sound to confident K.A.R.R. as me and K.I.T.T. plan on destroying
once and for all and once we do then I will make sure you are never
rebuilt again." replied Michael</P><P>"I wouldn't be
so cocky to say something like that as you will live to regret it."
said K.A.R.R.</P><P>"What do you
mean by that?" ask K.I.T.T. confuse</P><P>"I think of
telling you two. I will show you what I mean." replied K.A.R.R.</P><P>With that the
two sound ninja that came with K.A.R.R. came forward and Michael look
with a shock look on his face as he and K.I.T.T. saw four girls about
five years old being held by the two ninja. The first girl had dark
skin and gold cat like eyes with and long dark pink hair with cat
ears and a tail. The second girl had dark skin with long black hair
with pink bangs and black eyes. The third girl had short dark violet
with brown eyes and a dragon like mark on her right arm. The fourth
girl had long aqua blue hair with green eyes. Michael notice all four
of the girls look scared and were crying.</P><P>"Why do you
have these four innocent little girls with you?" ask Michael in a
shock voice</P><P>"The reason I
have them with me is for insurance to make sure you and K.I.T.T. do
not try to pull anything on me. You know I had to kill their entire
clans just to get a hold of them. You should have seen the looks on
their faces as they watch me kill their entire families right in
front of them." replied K.A.R.R. with a evil laugh</P><P>"You bastard
you killed their entire clans just so you could use them as hostages.
That isn't right. Even Orochimaru had more honor then you K.A.R.R..
You are pure evil and me and K.I.T.T. are going make sure we destroy
you once and for all so you can't kill anyone else." said Michael
with pure hate and venom in his voice looking at K.A.R.R.</P><P>"I would like
to see you try Michael Knight. And once I am done with you and
K.I.T.T. I will then destroy Sarah Graimen and the original K.I.T.T.
and then I will destroy the Village Hidden in the Leafs and wipe it
off the face of the earth." said K.A.R.R.</P><P>"Then lets get
this battle over with." said Michael getting inside of K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Yes I had
enough of you two long enough." said K.A.R.R.</P><P>With that both
K.I.T.T. and K.A.R.R. charge each other. K.I.T.T. fired his missiles
at K.A.R.R. which K.A.R.R. avoided and fired his own missiles at
K.I.T.T. that hit him and sent him backwards a few feet. Michael then
had K.I.T.T. transform into attack mode and charge K.A.R.R. and
K.A.R.R. transform into robot mode and fired his machine guns at
K.I.T.T. and then hit him with one of his hands that sent K.I.T.T.
fliping backwards a couple of feet and landed hard upright and then
K.A.R.R. fired his missiles at K.I.T.T. and Michael who barely dodge
them just in the nick of time.</P><P>"Michael I
don't know how much longer we can take a beating from K.A.R.R. before
we are destroyed as he has knock out most of my weapons systems."
said K.I.T.T. worried</P><P>"I know what
you mean K.I.T.T. . But we can't give up until K.A.R.R. is destroyed
once and for all. If we can't out muscle him then we have to outsmart
him. Do we still have Turbo Boost?" said Michael</P><P>"Yes Turbo
Boost is still working Michael." replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Good then
leave everything to me and when I gave the word you use Turbo
Boost." said Michael</P><P>With that
Michael turn K.I.T.T. around and headed start towards K.A.R.R. who
fired his machine guns and missiles at them which they avoided and
kept on heading start towards him at full speed. When they got within
20 feet Michael decide it was time to end this.</P><P>"K.I.T.T Turbo
Boost now." shouted Michael</P><P>With that
K.I.T.T. activated the Turbo boost and launch himself right into the
air and right at K.A.R.R. . As soon as K.I.T.T. hit K.A.R.R. he went
right through him and there was a huge explosion as K.I.T.T. and
Michael went right through K.A.R.R. and he blew apart into millions
of pieces of scrap metal. Once they landed K.I.T.T. look damage but
was otherwise alright as was Michael as they watch the remains of
K.A.R.R. hit the ground.</P><P>"Looks like it
is finally over Michael." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>"Yes it is
K.I.T.T. . But we still have one more thing to take care of before we
head home." said Michael</P><P>With that
Michael and K.I.T.T. headed over to the two ninja who were still
holding the four girls hostage. The two ninja watch as K.I.T.T. stop
in front of them and Michael got out and look at the two ninja with a
angry look on his face.</P><P>"You two let
these four girls go before what happen to K.A.R.R. happens to you."
said Michael with hate in his eyes telling the two ninja he meant
what he said</P><P>"Sure thing
mister Michael Knight." replied the first ninja</P><P>"Yeah we was
getting tired of working for people like Orochimaru and K.A.R.R.. I
think we will just leave before something bad happens to us." said
the other ninja</P><P>With that the
two ninja took off leaving Micahel and K.I.T.T. alone with the four
girls.</P><P>"Are you four
alright?" ask Michael</P><P>"Yes we are
thanks to you two." replied the girl with cat ears and tail trying
to hide her tears</P><P>"That's good
to know my name is Michael Knight and this here is my friend K.I.T.T.
. What are you names may I ask." said Michael</P><P>"May name is
Pink. " replied the first girl</P><P>"May name is
Rose." said the girl with black hair and pink bangs.</P><P>"The names
Akiza." said the girl with dark violet hair.</P><P>"And my name
is Runo." said the girl with aqua blue hair</P><P>"Michael what
are we going to do we these four girls since K.A.R.R. killed their
entire clans?" ask K.I.T.T. curious</P><P>"Well I am
thinking of adopting these four as my daughters since they have no
place else to go. That's if they don't mind." replied Michael
looking at the four girls.</P><P>"Why would you
want to adopt us since you just met us?" ask Pink confuse</P><P>"Because like
you four I lost both my birth parents when I was born." replied
Michael in a sad voice</P><P>"So you mean
you are going to be are dad from now on?" ask Rose curious</P><P>"Yes I will
and I know my wives will be happy to raise you four as well as their
own children." replied Michael</P><P>"So this means
we don't have to be alone anymore?" ask Akiza</P><P>"Yes it does
and I know you four will be happy once you meet everyone." replied
Michael</P><P>"This is the
happiest day of our life's since we are going to have a family
again." said Runo hugging Michael</P><P>"I know it
will be for you four. K.I.T.T. can you transform into your S.U.V.
Form and contact my mom and tell her to meet us back at the house and
tell Kyuubi and the others we are bringing some new members of the
family with us and tell Madar and Sarah to send some people to pick
up the remains of K.A.R.R. at once." said Michael looking at
K.I.T.T.</P><P>"As you wish
Michael." replied K.I.T.T. contacting Tsunade and the others to
tell them what had happen and contacting Madara and Sarah to send
some people to pick up the remains of K.A.R.R.</P><P>With that
K.I.T.T. transform into his S.U.V. Form and Michael got inside of
K.I.T.T. with Pink,Rose, Akiza and Runo and headed straight for the
house. After 20 minutes of driving they finally reach the house and
Michael headed inside with the four girls and saw Tsunade and Kyuubi
sitting at the table with the others waiting for him.</P><P>"Michael you
made it back." said Kyuubi</P><P>"Yeah I did
and we don't have to worry about K.A.R.R anymore as me and K.I.T.T.
destroyed him once and for all." said Michael</P><P>"That's good
to hear Michael. But who are these four little angels with you?"
ask Sakura looking at Pink,Rose,Akiza,and Runo</P><P>"These four
are Pink,Rose,Akiza and Runo. K.A.R.R. killed their entire clans and
took them hostages to make sure me and K.I.T.T. didn't pull anything
on him." replied Michael</P><P>"You mean
K.A.R.R. killed their entire clans just so he could use them as
Hostages?" ask Itachi shock</P><P>"Yes he did.
Itachi but me and K.I.T.T. made sure K.A.R.R. payed with his life for
killing off their clans." replied Michael</P><P>"So what are
they going to do now since they have no place else to go?" ask Ino
concern</P><P>"Well that is
why they are here with me. Because I plan on adopting them and raise
them as our daughters if that is fine with all of you." replied
Michael</P><P>"That is fine
with us. Besides who wouldn't want to take these four and raise them
as their children. They are so cute." said Ayame</P><P>"So does this
mean you will adopt us?" ask Pink curious</P><P>"Of course we
will. As far as we are all concern you are members of this family
from now on." said Anko looking at Pink</P><P>"This means we
can all go you are moms?" ask Rose</P><P>"Yes you can
." said Rio</P><P>"Yeah and from
now on you can go this pace your home." said Eve</P><P>"Thank you
very Mommy Eve." said Akiza</P><P>"Well since it
appears things are settles I will let you all get some rest and
tomorrow I will come back with the papers as you as it appears you
all need rest after what happen with K.A.R.R. ." said Tsunade</P><P>"Yeah we will
see you tomorrow mom." said Michael</P><P>Before Tsunade
could leave she was stop by Runo who had grab on to her leg.</P><P>"What do you
think you are doing young lady?" ask Tsunade looking down at Runo</P><P>"I just wanted
to say good bye to my new Grandma." replied Runo smiling</P><P>"Well since
you are a member of this family now that does make me your Grandma.
So I will come here tomorrow to see you and everyone else." said
Tsunade smilng</P><P>With that
Tsunade gave Runo a hug and left the house to finish the paperwork
she had to do. Once she left Michael and the others decided it had
been a long day and it was time for bed. With they went upstairs and
Kyuubi and Sakura showed Pink and the other three girls to the spare
rooms where they would be staying and told them tomorrow they would
go shopping for their new cloths. Once they were in bed. Michael
decided to head to bed as well and told everyone goodnight. Once he
was in bed. Michael was thinking about everything that had happen to
him over the last 7 years and was happy that K.A.R.R. was now finally
destroy for good and he and K.I.T.T. could relax and not worried
about everything for a long time. With that Michael look at the full
moon out his window and then fell asleep happy that everything was
finally over with K.A.R.R. and that he could now live a peaceful life
at last.</P><P>That's it for
this chapter. So what did you think of the final battle between
K.I.T.T. and K.A.R.R.. The reason I had K.A.R.R. be destroyed the way
he did was as a tribute to both Knight Rider Series. There our only
two more chapters left in this story before it is all over. The next
one will take place nine months later and the last chapter will take
place five years after this chapter. As always please leave reviews
and comments as I want people's options on this story. Thanks and
stay tune for the next chapter.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>Stranded Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto
or Knight Rider. Naruto is own by Masashi Kishimoto and Knight Rider
is own by NBC. I don't make money off this story.</P><P><U>Nine Months Later</U></P><P>It now had been
nine months since K.A.R.R. was defeated and Michael and his wives had
adopted Pink,Runo,Rose and Akiza and during that time Michael had
been working real hard on the nursery with K.I.T.T. helping him with
the blueprints to get it ready in time for when the babies would come
and after almost nine months the nursery was finally ready and
Michael was real proud on how it turn out. Now Michael was sitting at
the table eating dinner with his eight wives and his four daughters
along with his mom Tsunade and Sarah talking about everything that
had happen to them since K.A.R.R. had been destroyed.</P><P>"So Michael
have you and your wives decided what to name your children when they
are born?" ask Tsunade</P><P>"Well we
haven't come up with any good names yet mom. But I am sure when the
time comes we will give them good names." replied Michael smiling</P><P>"Well I am
sure you will give your children some good names. Which remains me.
Do you want them to be all boys or all girls or maybe both." said
Sarah</P><P>"Well Sarah me
and the other girls have talk about this with Michael and we wouldn't
mind if they were all girls." said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah I
wouldn't mind having a little girl as well and I know Michael here
wouldn't mind as well." said Ino</P><P>"Well that is
good to know." said Tsunade</P><P>"So Sarah how
are things going with keeping K.A.R.R.'s remains lock up so no one
could rebuild him ever again?" ask Ayame curious</P><P>"Well me and
Madara have put K.A.R.R.'s remains in a close off room at Knight
Industries that can only be access by Michael here so we shouldn't
have to worry about K.A.R.R. for a very long time." replied Sarah</P><P>"That's good
to know as I would hate to have Michael and K.I.T.T. have to face him
ever again." said Anko</P><P>"So how are
things going with Pink and the other girls?" ask Tsunade</P><P>"Everything is
going great with them Tsunade and they could hardly wait for the
babies to be born." replied Itachi</P><P>"You see how
eager they are for the babies to be born Tsunade. They are very
excited at the idea of being big sisters." replied Kyuubi</P><P>"So where are
they right now?" ask Sarah curious</P><P>"Well right
now they are over at Kurenai's house to visit her and I can image
they must be telling Kurenai all about the babies like for the 100 th
time." replied Rio</P><P>"They should
be back in about an hour as I know they want to see their
grandmothers." said Eve</P><P>"Well I know
they are. And of course I have been working nonstop with K.I.T.T.
working on his systems to make sure me and him are ready in case of
any danger to the village." said Michael</P><P>"Well I know
you want to be prepare for any attack as always Michael. But I think
you should just relax as we don't have to worry about anyone like
K.A.R.R. causing trouble for a long time. Besides you need to focus
on your family as they needed you now." said Tsunade</P><P>"I know you
are right mom. So I promise I will focus on my family as they come
first before anything else." said Michael</P><P>"That is good
to hear from you Michael." said Sarah</P><P>With that they
went back to eating their dinner. When all of a sudden Michael saw
Sakura and his other wives clutch their chest like they were in pain.</P><P>"Sakura are
you and the others alright?" ask Michael</P><P>"I don't think
so Michael. I think my water broke." replied Sakura</P><P>"Yeah all our
waters broke as well Michael." said Kyuubi</P><P>"Mom can you
call the hospital and tell them that Sakura and the others waters
have broken and are in labor." said Michael looking at Tsunade</P><P>"Oh course
Michael." said Tsunade going over to the phone</P><P>"What do you
want me to do Michael?" ask Sarah</P><P>"I want you to
call Kabuto and Tayuya and tell them to come over and wait for the
ambulance to come and pick up Sakura and the others to bring them to
the hospital while me and K.I.T.T. go and pick up Pink and the other
girls and we will meet you all at the hospital as soon as we can."
replied Michael</P><P>"Oh course
Michael." said Sarah</P><P>With that
Michael ran out the door as Tsunade and Sarah had everything covered
and got inside of K.I.T.T. who saw the look Michael had on his face.</P><P>"Michael what
is the matter?" ask K.I.T.T. concern</P><P>"While
K.I.T.T. Sakura and the others are in labor and we need to head over
to Kurenai's house and pick up Pink and the other girls and head over
to the hospital at once to meet the others." replied Michael</P><P>With that
K.I.T.T. transform into his S.U.V. Form and they drove off towards
Kurenai's house to pick up the girls at once. Once they got to
Kurenai's house and pick up the girls they quickly drove to the
hospital and got there within 20 minutes and Michael and the girls
headed inside leaving K.I.T.T. outside since he couldn't go in the
hospital since he was a car. Once they got inside Michael saw Tsunade
and Sarah sitting with Kabuto and Tayuya in the waiting room.</P><P>"Mom what has
happen so far? Is everything alright with Sakura and the other?"
ask Michael worried</P><P>"Calm down
Michael everything is alright according to the doctors so far and
Sakura and the others should be ready to deliver the babies anytime
now. So don't worry to much." replied Tsunade in a calm voice</P><P>"That's good
to know then." said Michael calming down</P><P>"Daddy is
something wrong with Mommy Sakura and the others?" ask Pink concern</P><P>"Everything is
alright Pink. Mommy Sakura and the others are just in the hospital to
give birth to your baby siblings." replied Michael in a calm voice</P><P>"Your dads
right. Everything is going to be just fine as your Grnadma Tsunade is
going to be the one to deliver the babies when it is time." said
Kabuto looking at Pink</P><P>"You mean
Grandma Tsunade is going to be the one to deliver Mommy Sakura and
the others babies?" ask Runo</P><P>"Yes I am Runo
and you and your sisters don't have anything to worry about since I
will be right there with your mothers at all times." replied
Tsunade</P><P>"Yeah Tsunade
is right Runo. Everything is going to be alright we her right there
with your mothers delivering the babies." added Tayuya</P><P>"So is Mommy
Sakura and the other going to have girls or boys?" ask Akiza
curious</P><P>"Well we don't
know that right now Akiza as we have to wait for the babies to be
born." replied Michael</P><P>"Well I hope
they will have all girls daddy." said Rose</P><P>"Well you know
what Rose something tells me you are right about that." said
Michael shaking her hair</P><P>With that they
sat down in the waiting room to wait for when it was time for the
babies to be delivered. After two hours the doctor came out and told
Tsunade it was time for the babies to be delivered and she got up and
look at Michael.</P><P>"Michael I
want you to stay here while I go into the delivery room and help
deliver the babies since you are not allowed into the delivery room.
Do I make myself clear." said Tsunade looking at Michael</P><P>"Crystal clear
mom." replied Michael</P><P>"Good now I
have to go and get ready to go into the delivery room to help deliver
the babies. But I will come back as soon as possible to tell you and
the others how everything went." said Tsunade</P><P>With that
Tsunade headed towards the delivery room to get ready to deliver the
babies. Once she was gone Michael took the watch on his left arm that
kept him in contact with K.I.T.T. and held it to his face.</P><P>"K.I.T.T. can
you read me?" said Michael into the watch</P><P>"Yes I can
hear you Michael. What is it you want ?" replied K.I.T.T.</P><P>"I want you to
tap into the cameras in the delivery room and record everything that
happens in there as the babies are born. Do you understand that?"
said Michael</P><P>"Yes I do
Michael. But why do you want me to do this thing for?" ask K.I.T.T.
confuse</P><P>"Because since
my mom said I can't go in the delivery room and watch my children
being born. I decided to have you tap into the cameras in there and
record them being born since that why I can watch it later with
Sakura and the others and I know what happen in there. Do you have a
problem with that K.I.T.T.?" replied Michael</P><P>"No I don't
Michael. I will do it right away." said K.I.T.T.</P><P>With that
Michael turn off the communication line and K.I.T.T. did as Michael
ask and tap into the cameras inside the delivery room and started to
record everything. Meanwhile in the waiting room Kabuto had heard
what Michael had ask K.I.T.T. to do and decide to talk to Michael.</P><P>"Michael what
do you think you are doing asking K.I.T.T. to tap into the cameras in
the delivery room for?" ask Kabuto curious</P><P>"Well Kabuto
my mom told me not to go in the delivery room but she never said I
couldn't have K.I.T.T. tap into the cameras in there and record my
children being born. Besides this way I have something to watch with
Sakura and the others to remember this day for a long time."
replied Michael</P><P>"You know what
Michael you sure can be sneaky sometimes when you want to be. But I
have to agree with you. It sounds like a good plan. But if Tsunade
yells at you for doing it if she finds out then don't drag me in the
middle of it okay." said Kabuto rolling his eyes over</P><P>"Oh course I
wouldn't dream of it Kabuto." said Michael</P><P>With that they
went back to waiting in the waiting room. After six more hours
Tsunade finally came out into the waiting room to tell how everything
had went with the delivery.</P><P>"Mom how did
everything go in the delivery room? Are Sakura and the others
alright?" ask Michael concern</P><P>"Yes they are
all alright Michael as are the babies." replied Tsunade</P><P>"So are they
boys or girls Grandma Tsunade?" ask Runo curious</P><P>"Well Runo
your Sakura gave birth to twin girls while the rest of your mothers
each gave birth to a girl." replied Tsunade smiling</P><P>"So where are
they now?" ask Michael</P><P>"They are all
in the recovery room resting with the babies and I think you should
go see them now alone since you should spend time with them."
replied Tsunade</P><P>"Oh course
mom. Lead the way." said Michael</P><P>With that
Michael got up out of his chair and followed Tsunade to the recovery
room where Sakura and the others were resting with the babies. Once
they got there Michael went inside as Tsunade went back to the
waiting room to see the others. Michael saw Sakura holding two little
girls in her arms while the others each had a little girl in their
arms. Michael saw that the first girl in Sakura's arms look just like
her while the other girl had red hair and green eyes. Michael look
over to Anko and saw the girl in her arms had the same hair and eyes
as her. Michael then went over to Kyuubi and Ayame and saw that the
girl in Kyuubi arms look just like her with Fox ears and nine fox
tails and the girl in Aymae arms had her brown hair and eyes. Next
Michael went over to Ino and Itachi and saw the girl in Ino arms had
white hair and pink eyes with pink leaf marks on the right side of
her body and the girl in Itachi arms had Itachi's hair and eyes.
Finally Michael went over to Rio and Eve and saw the girl in Rio arms
had the same sliver hair and eyes as her and the girl in Eve's arms
had the same gold hair as Eve but with Michael's dark emerald green
eyes.</P><P>"You eight did
a great job. Are daughters are the most perfect things in the world."
said Michael giving each of them a kiss on the lips</P><P>"We are all
glad you are happy as we are as our children are the most perfect
things in this world." said Sakura</P><P>"Yeah just
look at them. They are precious." said Anko</P><P>Meanwhile
Tsunade had lead the others to the recovery room and saw Michael and
the others resting with Michael holding the girl with red hair and
eyes smiling.</P><P>"Daddy are
these are baby sisters?" ask Runo curious</P><P>"Yes they are
Runo." replied Michael smiling at her</P><P>"So what are
there names?" ask Sarah curious</P><P>"Well me and
Michael decide to name the girl who looks like me Sakura after myself
and the girl with red hair and green eyes we decided to name after
Michael's birth mother Kushina." replied Sakura</P><P>"Well me and
Michael decided to name are little girl here Kurenai after my best
friend ." said Anko</P><P>"Well me and
Michael have decide to name our girl Sasame ." said Ayame</P><P>"Me and
Michael here have decided to name our little girl Kagura." said Ino</P><P>"Well me and
Michael have decided to name our daughter here Crystal." said
Itachi</P><P>"Well me and
Michael decided to name our girl Sarah after you of course Sarah."
said Kyuubi</P><P>"Michael and
me have decided to name our little girl here Rin after one of
Michael's father's students." said Rio</P><P>"Well me and
Michael have decide to name our little girl here Tsunade after you
Lady Tsunade." said Eve smiling</P><P>"Well those
are some good names for them." said Tayuya</P><P>"So when will
Sakura and the others be ready to leave the hospital with the
babies?" ask Kabuto curious</P><P>"Well
according to the doctor Sakura and the others will be ready to leave
the hospital in a week with the babies." replied Michael</P><P>"Well that is
good to here as that gives us time to prepare for what we have in
store for you and them." said Sarah</P><P>"What do you
mean by that Grnadma Sarah?" ask Michael confuse</P><P>"While you
will have to just wait and see when you all come home. But until then
Sakura and the others should get some rest as they needed it from the
delivery. And oh Michael K.I.T.T. told me you told him to tap into
the delivery room cameras and record everything that happen in there
and I told Sakura and the others before I came to get you. But don't
worry your not in trouble as I can understand why you did it. But
next time just ask me before you go ahead and do something like that
again." replied Tsunade smiling</P><P>With that
Tsunade and the others left Michael and his wives alone. One week
later Michael and his wives had come home with their children and
Michael open the door to the house. When they all got inside they saw
everyone waiting inside the house with a huge banner that said
welcome home.</P><P>"So this is
what you all have been up to over the past week?" ask Michael
surprise</P><P>"Oh course we
decided to throw you all a welcome home party for you and the
babies." replied Kurenai smiling</P><P>"So what do
you guys think of our surprise?" ask Tayuya</P><P>"All we can
say is thank you all very much of thinking of us and the children."
replied Sakura</P><P>"While that is
good to hear. But how about we get this party started." said Kabuto</P><P>With that the
party started and everyone talk about what had happen over the past
year to them and were very glad that there was now peace in the world
at long last. After the party was over and everything was clean up
Michael was sitting at the table with his mom Tsunade as Sakura and
the others had put the children to bed and were now sleeping as well.</P><P>"So what did
you think of the party Michael?" ask Tsunade</P><P>"Well it was
something that me and the others will never forget. But something
tells me you want to talk about something more important then just
the party." replied Michael</P><P>"Just I do
have something important to talk with you about Michael as it can't
wait until the morning." said Tsunade</P><P>"So what is it
you want to talk about Mom?" ask Michael confuse</P><P>"While you see
Michael I talk to the counsel yesterday about who was going to
replace me as Hokage when I retired and I told them I wanted you to
be the one to become the next Hokage and since everyone in the
village still thinks you are dead it made it easier for the counsel
to agree with me. But I want to know if you want to become the next
Hokage as I need to tell the counsel by tomorrow your decision before
they make any announcements by that time. So will take my place as
Hokage when the day comes I will have to retire and protect this
village with your life?" replied Tsunade</P><P>"Well mom it
has being my dream since I was young to to become Hokage to protect
this village and I think it would honor my birth parents and the old
man if I took the job. So I will become the next Hokage just to honor
their memories and protect this village with my life." replied
Michael</P><P>"Well I am
glad to hear that from you Michael. Now if you can excuse me I have
to get back to my office and finish off the rest of my paperwork and
tell the counsel what you have decide. So I will see you and everyone
else later." said Tsunade</P><P>With that
Tsunade left. Once she was gone Michael look out the window at the
full moon and smiled.</P><P>"I hope I can
live up to the legacy of my parents and the old man and become a good
Hokage as I know it means the world to them and I will do whatever it
takes to honor them and protect this village with my life and that is
a promise of a lifetime." thought Michael with hope in his eyes</P><P>With that
Michael got out of his seat and headed upstairs to get some rest and
spend some time with his family.</P><P>That's it for
this chapter. So what did you think of the birth of Michael's
children and the fact he will become the next Hokage. As always
please review and leave comments as I want people options on this
story. Thanks and stay tune for the final chapter.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><p>Stranded Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto or Knight Rider. Naruto is own by Masashi Kishimoto and Knight Rider is own by NBC. I don't make money off this story.</p><p><u>Five Years Later</u></p><p>It now had been five years since Michael and K.I.T.T. had defeated K.A.R.R. and now inside the Hokage's office the Sixth Hokage Michael was sitting at his desk looking out the window at the village and thinking about everything that had happen to him over the past five years.</p><p>"I can't believe it has only been five years since me and K.I.T.T. destroyed K.A.R.R. and my daughters were born to me. I mean it only seems like it was yesterday they were only little babies and now they are five years old and my four adopted daughters are already ten." thought Michael smiling</p><p>All of a sudden there was a knock at the door and Michael told whoever it was to come in and all of a sudden he felt two small bodies jump on him and sent him to the floor of the office and saw it was his two daughters Kushina and Sakura smiling at him.</p><p>"Kushina Sakura what do you two think you are doing here in my office?" ask Michael</p><p>"We came to see you daddy." replied Kushina smiling</p><p>"Yeah we wanted to know what you were up to and wondering when you would be done with all that boring paperwork." added Little Sakura</p><p>"Sakura Kushina what do you think the two of you are doing sending your poor father to the floor?" said Sakura who was standing over them</p><p>"We were just saying hi to daddy mommy." replied Kushina</p><p>"Yeah we were just happy to see him." said Little Sakura</p><p>"Well you two said hi to dad. Now how about you two get off of him and let him get to his feet." said Runo</p><p>With that Kushina and Sakura got off of Michael and he got back on his feet.</p><p>"Sorry about Kushina and Sakura sending you to the floor Michael. They just got overexcited to see as they were wondering if you were going to show up at the birthday party." said Sakura</p><p>"It's okay Sakura. They were just happy to see and I am almost done with all the paperwork so we can all head over to my little girls birthday party." said Michael giving Sakura a kiss on the lips</p><p>"Well from the looks of things you might be here a few hours dad." said Runo</p><p>"You forget Runo I always have my secret weapon for finishing off this paperwork when I am in a hurry." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael made a handsign and made about 20 shadow clones told them to finish the rest of the paperwork and Michael and the others left the office and headed towards the birthday party. When they got outside Michael saw K.I.T.T. waiting for them in his S.U.V. Form.</p><p>"K.I.T.T. what are you doing here? Aren't you suppose to be at the birthday party with the others waiting for us to show up?" ask Michael looking at K.I.T.T.</p><p>"I was Michael until Anko ,Sarah, and your mom started to worry if you would ever so up. So they sent me here to come pick you up and bring you and the others to the birthday party as your mom told me to." replied K.I.T.T.</p><p>"Well that is just like your mom Michael. Always worrying about you even know your the Hokage now." said Sakura</p><p>"Yeah I know Sakura. But that is why I love her as she was always looking out for me. But since K.I.T.T. is here we should all head to the birthday party as I know the others were wondering what is taking us so long to get there." replied Michael smiling</p><p>With that they all got inside of K.I.T.T. and they headed towards the house where the party was being held. After 15 minutes they reach the house saw everyone was there waiting for them. When they got out Michael was suddenly jump by two small bodies who grab him by his legs and saw it was his daughters Sasame and Kagura who both had smiles on their faces.</p><p>"Daddy you finally came to the party." said Sasame</p><p>"Yeah we were starting to worry you would never show up." added Kagura</p><p>"Well you can both see I am here as I would never miss my little girls birthday ever." replied Michael ruffing up their hair</p><p>"Let me guess you use the shadow clone jutsu to finish off the rest of your paperwork." said Ino's voice</p><p>Michael look up and saw his wives Ino and Ayame looking at him with smiles on their faces</p><p>"I guess I can never hide anything from the two of you. Now can I?" said Michael giving each of them a kiss on the lips</p><p>"While I think we can let it slide this time Michael as it is our daughters birthday today." said Ayame</p><p>"So where is everyone else?" ask Michael</p><p>"While momma Anko and Itachi are talking to Grandma Tsunade and Kurenai and Crystal are with them as well." replied Pink who was next to Ino</p><p>"Well I think I will go over and say hi to them as I know they must be wondering what was taking me so long getting here. And after I talk to them I will go say hi to everyone else." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael left them and started to head over where he saw his mom talking to Anko and Itachi with his other daughters. All of a sudden he was caught in a hug by his wife Anko who was starting to squeeze the very life out of him.</p><p>"Michael you finally showed up." said Anko squeezing Michael tighter</p><p>"Well I am glad to see you two Anko but can you let go of me as I am having a little trouble breathing." said Michael breathing hard</p><p>"Mommy I think you should do as daddy said as his face is starting to turn blue." said Kuernai</p><p>Anko look at Michael and saw her daughter was right and let go of Michael who was now trying to catch his breath.</p><p>"Sorry about that Michael. I guess I just got overexcited seeing you here." said Anko</p><p>"It's okay Anko sometimes you forget how strong you really are when you are excited." replied Michael giving her a kiss on the lips</p><p>"Well your right about that Michael. Anko does forget how strong she is sometimes." said Itachi who had shown up with Crystal and gave Michael a kiss on the lips</p><p>"Well I am just glad I am here to see my little girls turn five today. Right Crystal." said Michael looking down at his daughter</p><p>"I am glad you could show up daddy as everyone was worrying about you." replied Crystal smiling</p><p>"Well you know I could never miss this special day for the world." said Michael</p><p>"Let me guess you use the shadow clone jutsu again to finish off your paperwork." said Tsunade</p><p>"You would be right there mom. As I can never hide anything from you. " said Michael smiling</p><p>All of a sudden from out of nowhere Michael was tackle to the ground by his daughters Rin and Tsunade.</p><p>"Rin Tsunade what the two of you think you are doing tackling your father to the ground." said Eve as she and Rio had shown up to say hi to their husband along with Akiza</p><p>"We were just saying hi to daddy ." said Rin</p><p>"Yeah were just happy to see him." added Little Tsunade</p><p>"Well you two said hi to dad. Now get off of him this instance before momma Rio and Eve ground you." said Akiza</p><p>With that Rin and Tsunade got off of Michael and let him get to his feet.</p><p>"Sorry about tackling you to the ground daddy." said Rin</p><p>"Yeah we were just so happy to see you." said Little Tsunade</p><p>"It okay you two. You were just happy to see me and got overexcited." replied Michael smiling at the two of them.</p><p>"Well they better be careful next time or they will end up being grounded if they do." said Rio</p><p>"So how is everything going at the office?" ask Eve looking at Michael</p><p>"Everything is going great at the office." replied Michael giving the two of them a kiss on the lips</p><p>"Well we are just glad you could make it to the party." said Rio</p><p>"We just wish Kabuto and Tayuya could have shown up as well." said Everything</p><p>"I know but they had to go on a important mission in the Land of Lighting. But both of them send their regards to everyone and will see us very soon when they get back. So where is Kyuubi and Sarah at?" said Michael</p><p>"Well there with Rose talking to your grandmother Sarah and Viper about her work with Madara." replied Rio</p><p>"Well then I guess I will go over there and say hi to them before it is time for the birthday cake." said Michael</p><p>With that Michael headed in the direction of where Kyuubi was with Sarah and Viper and saw Kyuubi talking to Sarah about something when all of a sudden his daughter Sarah came running over to him and jump into his arms.</p><p>"Daddy you finally showed up. Mommy and Grandma Sarah were worried about you as me and Rose were to." said Little Sarah</p><p>"Well as you can see I am right here as I would never miss my little girl's birthday for the world." said Michael giving her a hug</p><p>"Well looks like you finally decided to show up Michael." said Kyuubi giving him a kiss on the lips</p><p>"Of course I decided to show up Kyuubi and it was nice that K.I.T.T. decided to come get me and the others." replied Michael</p><p>"Well since you were running late I decided to have K.I.T.T. go after you so you could make it here to the party on time." said Sarah</p><p>"Well I am glad you did Grandma Sarah as I didn't want to miss my children's birthday party for the world." said Michael</p><p>"So I take it you use the Shadow clone jutsu again to finish off your paperwork as you always do when your running late dad?" said Rose</p><p>"Well looks like I can never hide anything from my family. So how are things over at Knight Industries Grandma Sarah?" said Michael looking at Sarah</p><p>"Everything is going great over there since Madara is making everyone work hard to make sure everything is in order. I am just glad he let me and Viper come to the birthday party as he knows how important it is to me to see you and your children as you are all I have left of Michael and my son in this world." replied Sarah</p><p>"Well we are all glad you and Viper could come today." said Kyuubi</p><p>"So how is everything going with guarding the remains of K.A.R.R.?" ask Michael curious</p><p>"Everything is going well as K.A.R.R.'s remains are lock up and secure as his main chip has been shut down for good and he can never be reactivated ever again and rebuilt." replied Viper</p><p>"That's good to know as I don't want to ever face him again as I know K.I.T.T. doesn't either . But I think right now it is time for my nine little birthday girls here to get ready for cake and ice cream." said Michael smiling</p><p>With that they all headed over to the table where the others were sitting and Tsunade brought out the birthday cake and everyone sang happy birthday to the nine girls and Michael told his daughters to make a wish and blow out the candles which they did. After that the cake was cut and was serve as was the ice cream and everyone talk about what happen to all of them over the past five years and how lucky they were to have each other as family. Meanwhile deep inside of Knight Industries a guard was walking past the room that held K.A.R.R.'s remains and did a quick check to make sure everything was in order. The guard did a quick look and saw nothing out of place and move on. Once the guard had left and the lights in the room had shut off. All was quiet and peaceful until the part of K.A.R.R. that had the scanner with the light all of a sudden came to life and flash a amber yellow light back and forth .</p><p>THE END ?</p><p>That's it for this story. So what did you think of the cliffhanger at the end. If anyone wants to make a sequel to this story they have my permission to do one as I have no intention of doing one as long as they give me credit for the idea of this crossover and use the characters in this story then they can write it anyway they want to.
