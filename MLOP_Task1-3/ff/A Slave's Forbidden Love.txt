Deep within the castle's grounds, seated in a grand throne room, Naruto stared, horrified at what was before him. Sapphire blue eyes didn't once waiver from the form bent before him. His father had called him to the throne room, and after instructing his guards to bring something in, Naruto beheld the slumped almost dejected posture of a man before him. His father, Minato, laughed jovially and jeered at the guards holding the poor beast captive.</P><P>"He's a beauty, eh son?" he laughed. Then he leaned over closer to whisper in Naruto's ear, grin sinister and evil. The man was truly rotten, inside and out, and Naruto hated him with the entirety of his being.</P><P>"He's all yours." Naruto felt his throat close up on him, and tears sprang to beautiful blue eyes. Fighting not to show any emotion, and under the strict force of his will, they slowly disappeared once again. It was clear now that the man kneeling on the hard floor was intended to be his slave. The metal chain leading to the collar around his neck was a clear sign of slavery, as was his posture. Trying to keep his voice in control, the golden haired prince swallowed around the lump stuck in his throat, wanting to leap from his chair and tear his father's throat open.</P><P>"F-Father…may I be with him alone?" his voice, thankfully, only quivered a little. After years of practice Naruto had learned how to pull a veil over his emotions, fool his father and most of the kingdom. Minato, thinking this little slip was from excitement, laughed obnoxiously once again and called the guards away. With arrogance in his stride and a smirk on his handsome face, he exited the main hall, the door slamming behind him.</P><P>The moment the door was shut Naruto flashed out of his seat and to the poor beast- the man. He collapsed to his knees, uncaring of the hard ridges digging into his skin, eyes spilling tears as they gazed into the eyes of the other man. His hands fluttered uselessly around, and his mouth made words with no sound. Finally they settled in his lap, loosely clenched into the fabric of his jeans.</P><P>The man looked up at the sudden commotion, and his eyes widened in confusion and sadness at the tears in his new 'owners' eyes. Crimson eyes caught azure blue, and Naruto couldn't look away. Even if his life depended on it, something in that stare kept him kneeling complacent and surprised. His gaze was so fierce, so untamed, but there was also a curiosity lying within their bloody depths. Naruto had obviously captured his interest, spilling his tears for one so low. One gentle, large hand rose to Naruto's face, and Naruto stilled his actions, clearly wary and distrustful, although tears still ran gently down his flushed cheeks. Petal pink lips parted slightly in surprise at the kindness held within his touch, but never once did his eyes stray from those facing him.</P><P>"Why do you cry, my pretty?" the man murmured, and with one thumb wiped away the tear that had spilled from Naruto's left eye. His voice was deep, with an almost unnoticeable growl to it. It soothed Naruto, slowed the tears that dripped from long lashes with every blink. Naruto resisted the urge to lean into the man's caring hand, calloused and scarred as it was, and he gave a quiet sob.</P><P>"Someone…so wild…and so perfect…should not be a slave, especially to a person like me…" Naruto whimpered quietly, pride completely forgotten as his true sensitive nature was revealed. He never showed this side of himself, only ever to Ino. Something about this man made him feel like he could open up to him.</P><P>The man felt his eyes soften at the agony in his words. The one before him was so beautiful…and so warm. He clearly had a heart of gold. His wild golden hair was untamed, and sapphire blue eyes peered out from bronzed skin. As the son of the King of Konoha, he must go out a lot. But why? From everything he'd seen and heard of the King, he was a cruel arrogant ruler, and his son supposedly followed in his footsteps. The man was no fool, he had seen the flawless act put on for the boy's father. Clearly he was his own person beneath that awful façade.</P><P>"Why are you so different…?" the man murmured quietly, his large hand still placed ever so gently on Naruto's cheek. He could never bring himself to hurt someone so pure. He may be a demon, but there were many misconceptions about demons. He had wanted to kill the king and his son upon capture, but now seeing the kindness and sympathy positively shining from the small prince, he cursed himself for such thoughts. Naruto was shocked at the words, not really knowing what he meant or how to respond. What did he mean by different?</P><P>"D-Different how?" he mumbled in return, and his sapphire orbs fell to the floor, finally breaking the intense soul searching gaze. The man chuckled, a deep humored sound, and it sent a shiver down Naruto's spine.</P><P>"You are tan while your father is pale. You are so kind hearted while your father is so cold. You are the son of the king, yet you are not spoilt or arrogant…you care for someone who is meant to be your slave. The word outside these walls is that you are exactly as your father, but I can see that is not true. So, you are clearly not as you appear…" he trailed off, hoping this would lead Naruto onto his trail of thought and not confuse the young beauty any more.</P><P>Naruto stiffened, completely rigid under the man's hand. Pulling away slightly until he was free from the man's touch. Nobody had made these connections before, he had always been so careful to keep it concealed. Yet this slave had somehow seen past it all, seen past his act towards his father. Although some of it was Naruto's fault, for letting his true self show to his slave. But you couldn't blame him, he had a tender heart and he couldn't handle the thought of owning someone just like him. He wouldn't lie to someone like that.</P><P>He met the man's gaze, it hadn't moved even when he had shied away. A sudden impulse made him decide- he was going to reveal his most hidden secret to this man before him. It was a dangerous move, and Naruto's mind betrayed him by saying that nobody would believe a slave, that he could beg him to keep his word. Although he could order him to as well. But Naruto had never felt so safe in someone's hold, he felt like the man could see right through him.</P><P>"This is why…" he murmured. Slowly his pupils shifted, and turned to slits. The beautiful sapphire bled to deep purple tinged with black, and one small hand rose to wipe his cheek. Makeup came off, and whisker marks appeared randomly as it refused to come completely off.</P><P>The man's eyes widened in recognition of all the signs, signs he hadn't seen in the hundreds of years he had been alive. Many nekos and other breeds existed, and though the man didn't know of what breed Naruto was, he could tell he was high on the power list. The marks were too deep, the transformation so blaringly obvious that he was no simple neko.</P><P>"That's not all." He stated, almost a growl as it came out. Naruto was shocked. It wasn't uncommon to see a shifter or a neko, but the fact still stood that Naruto's father was none of these things, yet his son was. Most of the blood of demons had faded after Minato had taken the throne. Violent purging of all the non human races had begun, and almost all those who were more than half demon had fled. If this man knew the signs, then he must be either an expert or a partial demon (or full, which was rare) himself.</P><P>"How do you-?" The man locked his gaze with his own again, the intensity completely cutting off any words Naruto would have spoken. It was almost a rhetorical question, as Naruto's train of thought had already revealed that this man was a demon of some sort.</P><P>"Because you are like me."</P><P>Naruto choked up slightly, his emotions crazy as he was caught between happy and afraid. His suspicions had been confirmed. This man was clearly more than half demon, it was obvious in the way he spoke and his physical appearance. Unlike Naruto, he didn't hide the long strikes on his cheeks or his slit pupils.</P><P>"What's your name…?" Naruto managed to whimper out, head dropping slightly and looking up at the man from his lowered position. The man gave a low growl of approval at the slight sign of submission. He knew he would not be treated as a slave by the beauty, and he was a very powerful full demon. It pleased him to see another strong demon showing submissive tendencies.</P><P>"Kyuubi…Kyuubi No Kitsune." With the utterance the air in the room shifted as if uneasy, and Kyuubi's flaming hair danced in it. His power was nearly tangible, and briefly the blonde wondered how such an incredibly commanding creature could have been captured by someone as low as his father. Then again, many others had been taken by him as well.</P><P>"I-I'm Naruto…Naruto U-"</P><P>Before Naruto could open his mouth to continue telling Kyuubi his name, there was a loud knock on the door, signaling Minato was coming. Their time was up. Naruto stood quickly, wiping the tears from his face. His hands came together in a seal, and he mumbled a few rapid words under his breath. Instantly his marks were covered, and with an effort his eyes were normal again as well.</P><P>Kyuubi's arm dropped and he bowed his head respectfully, once more the perfect slave. The two had completely perfected their appearances in seconds, ready for the king to return. Naruto fixed his clothing, pulling a disdainful look over his face just as his father opened the door. Minato burst in with a bellowing laugh. The guards shadowed him perfectly, faces impassive and betraying nothing.</P><P>"Eh? Eh? You like him son?" he bellowed, slapping Naruto on the back harshly. However his eyes, a blue not as pure and enticing as Naruto's, were slightly cold, as if he was hiding a secret disgust for his son. He was a rather handsome man, but even Naruto's human eyes were so much more beautiful in Kyuubi's opinion.</P><P>Naruto winced slightly under the blow, but Kyuubi knew it was faked. If Naruto was anything relatively close to him or his kind, that blow wasn't even strong enough to be an annoyance. Naruto turned to face his father, and Kyuubi watched with awe and respect as his gentle face transformed from disgust at his father to a kind, happy, obedient mask.</P><P>"Yes, father. Thank you, I do like him. May I take him to my room?" he queried. His words were fluid and polite, betraying absolutely nothing. Picture perfect. His stance and facial expressions nearly fooled Kyuubi, it was so well-practiced. Minato easily fell for the charm, as he had all his life. He pushed out his chest proudly and nodded in acceptance, sitting in his chair as he waved the two out.</P><P>Naruto bowed and grabbed the chain connected to Kyuubi's collar, making the motion to jerk it harshly. Perfectly at the last moment he made it go lax and Kyuubi only felt a tiny tug. He acted along, making it seem like he was being jerked forward, but he gave a sly wink at Naruto when he was sure nobody could see.</P><P>The effect was priceless, in Kyuubi's opinion. Naruto caught the wink, and instantly his face turned the color of Kyuubi's hair. He hid his face with his hair quickly as he looked sharply away, a small squeak being heard. His pace was hurried as he moved down the hallway, until the door behind them closed with a deafening boom, obscuring Minato from view.</P><P>Naruto instantly let the lead go slack as soon as they were alone in one of the abandoned corridors, and Kyuubi stood from his bent position of a slave's rank. The redhead was a good foot and a half taller than the prince, though Naruto was very short and feminine anyways. Naruto did not speak, and Kyuubi did not push him. It was obvious the prince was struggling with everything that had transpired. As they walked, Kyuubi remained slightly behind Naruto despite his much longer stride, smirking as he realized he was still a cherry red color. About halfway down the hallway, Naruto rounded on Kyuubi, spluttering and stuttering indignantly.</P><P>"W-What was that for!" he hissed, his blush fiery and not diminishing in the least. Kyuubi got an idea, and decided to test Naruto again. Oh how he loved the reactions already! They were addicting, like the sweetest candy, and Kyuubi wanted to see how far he could push Naruto. What reactions he could garner from the boy. Kyuubi leaned forward slightly, his presence and body pressing in towards Naruto, and took a step forward. Naruto started to lean backwards, and took a step back to match Kyuubi's. His eyes were confused but his face was still rather pink, and the closer Kyuubi got the more disheveled he looked. Kyuubi let a devilish smirk slowly build upon his lips at how sensitive Naruto was, so much so that even his presence was setting him off, and his eyes were alive with flame.</P><P>"Because I could…" Naruto shivered at the sound. Kyuubi's voice was like a mix between a passionate, teasing purr and a possessive, dominating growl. Naruto's face, if possible, turned even redder. Kyuubi gave a loud laugh, and Naruto growled, insulted. He knew he was not as strong as Kyuubi, but he was angry that someone could affect him so much and take it as a joke. He was also starting to panic, knowing he wasn't strong enough to fight Kyuubi away and feeling terrified. Never had he felt he couldn't handle himself, and being backed into a corner stirred his instincts.</P><P>Kyuubi froze, recognizing the stirrings of power within the boy, seeing the angered and insulted look on his face. "Calm down, my pretty…" he soothed, and slowly reached out and cupped Naruto's face. This move blinded his peripherals, keeping his gaze on Kyuubi so that he could calm down. Leading him away from the wall to try and make him feel less cornered.</P><P>"Where is your bedroom?" he murmured, using the five-word, five-syllable rule to soothe a panicking mind. He had been in the wrong to corner Naruto like that, obviously it had brought up some sort of memory and he had panicked, trying to protect himself. In this case, he just didn't want Naruto to freak and lose control. From what Kyuubi had seen, Naruto had been taught nothing of himself, his power, his heritage, or his kin. Yokai was extremely hard to contain, hard to control, and very powerful. If Naruto lost control, Kyuubi would be put in a hard spot.</P><P>Naruto fell complacent at his quiet soothing words; looking into his eyes and feeling Kyuubi's influence slowly seep over him. "Third door on the left…" he murmured quietly. Kyuubi smiled, seeing how his momentary panic, and the distress at having a slave pressed onto him, had exhausted the poor beauty.</P><P>"Good." Then he lifted his fingers to Naruto's forehead and tapped him gently, focusing and feeling the normal stir in his veins as his Yokai became active. Naruto's eyes rolled to the back of his head and he fell backward, unconscious. Kyuubi caught him easily, having anticipated this, and lifted him bridal-style, carrying him to the desired location.</P><P>Kyuubi propped open the door and peered inside, gaping. There was a simple illusion cast over the room by Naruto, and what was- in a humans eyes- a red and black room with a bed, was much different. The room was like Nature itself. The entire room was based around a large willow tree. Its trunk was large and nearly white with age, its branches going up and out until they weaved together to form a ceiling. The result was a dappled effect spreading all over the ground. Literally ground, as the entire room was nothing but dirt and long, lush grass. There was a small bookshelf carved naturally into the tree, little holes carefully molded using Yokai instead of chopping out portions of it, and the branches held knick-knacks and odd items. Little jars full of blinking insects, odd pieces of jewelry, and shiny reflective surfaces were all among the branches. At the base of the tree, there was a small den. It wasn't as deep or as long as a real den, but it was obvious that was what Naruto used as a bed.</P><P>On the other side of the room, across the vast field of long grass, was another 'wall' of the room, where many rocks had come together to form a small waterfall, trickling down into a pool- obviously what Naruto used as a bath. It was clear that the castle had an open spot, where there had probably been nothing. Naruto had made it look as though it was a room, creating a door leading to that outside area. An outside area that had clearly become his room. All around the room Nature was evident, and nothing was unnatural or human-made. Kyuubi was stunned to see such craftsmanship, especially from such an inexperienced shifter.</P><P>If he displaced the illusion, any human could see it, but if he did then Naruto would be more comfortable and the concentration to tell the difference between the illusion and the reality would disappear. Maintaining the illusion probably wasn't even a bother to him if he did it all the time, but Kyuubi wanted him as comfortable as possible. The older man clasped his hands together to form the sign for the ram and mumbled a few words. The illusion disappeared. He lay Naruto down in his bed and clambered swiftly up the tree, which groaned and thrashed in discomfort. This was a new chakra spirit, one that was not its kin, Naruto.</P><P>Kyuubi surveyed the room, which was actually much larger than he had thought. The little area was actually a very large area. The entire side of the castle had ended, and Naruto had simply extended his room past the wall, making it as big as he liked. Kyuubi looked down at the sleeping prince. Oh, yes, he'd have to stay here for a while. This was simply to rare and desired to pass up. Such raw talent, and without any guidance? And the boy had such a pure heart, Kyuubi couldn't leave him in the grasp of such a tainted, clearly controlling man. It screamed against his every instinct to protect the clearly submissive boy.</P><P>In the world of demons, even if you were only a partial demon, there were Guardians and Souls. Guardians were the dominant demons, the controller of the relationship, and almost always the top in any sexual encounter. Their job was to protect the Souls, whether it was their mate or not. Back before Minato had taken control, there had been large clans of demons. If ever they were attacked, the Souls were all banded together and the Guardians protected them all. Every Guardian had a mate, and in their life demons only took on one mate. It wasn't an instant realization, meeting your mate. Sometimes it took a while. Souls, or submissive demons, were the opposite of Guardians. They were called Souls because when Demons were first created, the Guardians drove themselves crazy because all they knew was how to protect. Souls were there to love them, to help heal them. It was obvious Naruto was a Soul, and Kyuubi had known since birth that he was a Guardian. Being a Guardian, it went against every fiber of his being to leave a Soul in danger.</P><P>Kyuubi jumped down and the tree instantly quieted its racket, clearly happy that the stranger was gone. Naruto had put a part of his very essence into all of it, so they had taken up their own spirits. Any living thing already had a spirit, but these were all amplified because of Naruto's interference. Kyuubi snorted and rolled his eyes at the tree, nestling down next to Naruto and keeping watch until morning.</P><p style="text-align:center;"><B>Morning</B></P><P>Naruto stirred, a small mewl escaping his lips. The memories trickled slowly until the point where Naruto had locked gazes with Kyuubi for the first time, and Naruto was instantly awake with a scream. The other memories hadn't yet returned, as his panic forced them back. Before Naruto could even barely start screaming, Kyuubi had leapt forward, clasping his hand firmly over Naruto's mouth. Naruto's eyes rolled wildly in fear, not understanding who was suddenly over him, before they locked with Kyuubi's. Something within Naruto told him, almost an instinct, to stop struggling- that this man meant no harm. He didn't know about Souls and Guardians, all he knew was that something inside him whispered to just let Kyuubi take care of him.</P><P>Naruto quieted instantly. Kyuubi quirked a brow in a silent question, and Naruto blinked an answer. Kyuubi slowly withdrew his hand, assured Naruto would not scream again, and rocked back on his heels. Naruto looked around and nearly fainted from the shock of seeing his room completely uncovered.</P><P>"You dispelled my illusion!" he hissed accusingly, though there was a blatant fear lacing his words. He didn't want to be found out, was afraid of what his father would do. He already hated demons fiercely, hated Naruto as a person, so Naruto was terrified of what would happen should he find out.</P><P>Kyuubi nodded. "Yes, I did. The strain of trying to move around what is not there would have been troublesome. Plus I didn't want it to be a strain on you." Naruto could have laughed as he remembered his dear friend, Shikamaru, who had always said that. At the time, considering how panicky he felt, he couldn't bring himself to be amused. It had been a long time since he had seen his old friend, and he truly missed him.</P><P>"Very well…and Kyuubi, this is going to sound weird but…" Naruto turned cherry red and unsuccessfully tried to continue on. He looked frustrated, struggling with what to say and how to say it. Kyuubi would have laughed, but he was too nice. Well he was actually a bit of a bastard, but he didn't want to be snapped at again or kicked out of his room. "Go on…" he urged.</P><P>"Why do I feel so comfortable with you when I've barely met you?" he asked quietly, rushed. Then his hand clasped over his mouth and his eyes went huge, clearly meaning to have worded it a different way. Kyuubi laughed, he couldn't help it. Naruto was just so…<I>cute. </I>Kyuubi mentally slapped himself. He was <I>not </I>going to think that!</P><P>"You know next to nothing about our world so I will explain. There are two types of demons, personality wise. It is placed within our very DNA when we are born. Souls are the submissives, they bottom in any sexual activities. They can be just as powerful as any dominant demon, which are called Guardians. The Guardian's job is to protect all Souls, especially his mate. Demons only take one mate, as it is their soul mate. Souls keep the Guardians sane, make sure they don't go crazy through wars and battles. Guardians in turn sate the need for love that all Souls have. It's a symbiotic relationship. You are a Soul, and I am a Guardian. It's in my nature to help and protect you, and it is in your nature to automatically trust me. Don't be worried, I know it's a lot to handle, but it's completely natural. Any other demon you meet, annoying or not, whether you hate them or are best friends, if they are a Guardian you will trust them." Kyuubi brought up one hand to caress Naruto's cheek again, and Naruto couldn't help it this time. He'd restrained himself during their first meeting, but he instinctively leaned towards the warmth, purring in contentment. His mind was at war trying to understand all of this, but after a few long moments of thought he finally managed to accept it.</P><P>"I like your hands…"</P><P>Kyuubi and Naruto simultaneously froze, both of them surprised by his words. Naruto turned beet red, and he stumbled over multiple apologies. Kyuubi dropped his hand, and stared at Naruto, both amused and confused. Almost flattered.</P><P>"You like my hands? What about them?" chuckling softly when he saw how Naruto leaned away from his touch, though it looked as if he sincerely did not want to retreat. Naruto took a few moments to collect himself, clearly embarrassed. The tree beside them moved according to his emotions, making a soft noise that sounded like giggling.</P><P>"They're large, workers hands. But they're gentle. I dunno I just like them okay!" Becoming brash in his embarrassment. Kyuubi chuckled, ruffling his hair.</P><P>"Well, thank you. I like them too."</P><P>They remained in quiet silence for awhile, completely relaxed in the other's presence. There was no need to talk, and it was a very nice peaceful quiet. One that Naruto broke.</P><P>"Leave."</P><P>Kyuubi's head snapped up, staring at the prince with wide eyes, not comprehending. "W-Wha-?" Naruto shook with emotion, not wanting in any way to explain what he meant but having to.</P><P>"I'm setting you free! Leave!" he insisted, tears gathering in his eyes. Kyuubi grit his teeth, his nature fighting him, telling him to soothe the pour prince, wipe away his tears. Realizing what Naruto was telling him, he shook his head, his jaw locking.</P><P>"No."</P><P>Naruto was shocked, unable to speak for a few long seconds before sputtering out a reply. "You want to stay a slave? To only be free when it's only you and I?" he gasped in disbelief, upset beyond belief. Kyuubi grasped Naruto's head gently in his hands, making him look into his eyes. Remaining in this position until Naruto had calmed a little more.</P><P>"I'm going to get you out of here, understand?" he murmured.</P><P>"What…?" Naruto asked, dazed. Kyuubi stroked his thumb over the soft tanned cheek. It was best if he didn't elaborate too much, but he had to comfort the boy at least a little.</P><P>"I'm going to get you out of here. I'm going to help you throw your father from his throne. You won't be held prisoner any longer. I promise you." Naruto nodded slowly, a look in his eyes so full of adoration and trust that Kyuubi nearly blushed. Standing, he helped Naruto to his feet and swept his eyes around the room. The prince had daily duties, and he needed to be dressed well. If they stayed in his room any longer, someone would come knocking and the pair couldn't afford that.</P><P>He rushed to the closet Naruto had woven from the tree, having discovered what he was searching for. Quickly sorting through the good kimonos, he landed on a black one with a silver waist bow and lining. The only pattern was a mix of dark blue and silver, not particularly feminine or masculine. He thrust it at Naruto, placing it firmly in his hands. "Change into this, and I shall act as your slave."</P><P>Naruto shook his head rapidly in denial. "No I won-" Kyuubi rushed forward, and Naruto, squeaking in surprise, ran backwards into the tree. Kyuubi pinned him, his hands on either side of Naruto's head, their bodies inches apart. Naruto's breath froze in his chest, eyes wide and hands trembling though he didn't know why.</P><P>"I shall act as your slave, my pretty. Now please, change." Kyuubi leaned forward, his head resting beside Naruto's, breath ghosting over the shell of his ear. "For me?"</P><P>Naruto, whether from shock or the need to get away from the heat known as the Kyuubi No Kitsune, nodded rapidly. He rushed off to change, completely red in the face while Kyuubi watched him retreat with a smirk.</P><P>Oh yes, this was going to be very interesting.</P><p style="text-align:center;"><B>Fin</B></P><P><B>Edit: </B>Sunday, July 15, 2012 9:41pm</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>Edit: </B>June 18th 3:49pm</P><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter Two- Competition</P><P>It had been about a week since Naruto, Prince of Konoha, and Kyuubi, Konoha's most feared Demon, had met. Naruto had not taken to Kyuubi being his slave well, but over the span of these seven days he had learned to stop fighting, enjoying the freedom they had whenever they were in Naruto's room.</P><P>Naruto awoke to gentle shaking, a hand on his shoulder bleeding warmth through his thin cotton shirt. Groaning in annoyance he rolled over, swatting at the pesky hand that was shaking him. Naruto was a morning person, but after yesterday's trying day he was against the idea of awakening.</P><P>"Mmm…five more minutes!" he groaned, burying his head under his arms and wishing for once he had a pillow to cover his head with. There was a smooth chuckle, and Naruto shivered as the sound was recognized within his sleepy brain. His arms were pulled gently off his head, making Naruto whine unhappily at being unearthed, eyes blinking sleepily as the light assaulted him. Groaning he finally got up, shaking moss out of his hair. They had set up a new alarm instead of putting an illusion on his room. Any person other than Kyuubi and Naruto walking within forty feet of the room would alert the two, giving them enough time to put it up should they need to.</P><P>Kyuubi chuckled again at the unhappy look on his face, poking Naruto's cheek with one finger. Naruto mewled and clawed at his hand, not liking the teasing at all so early in the morning. Kyuubi laughed again, shaking the boy to ensure he was really away. Naruto growled at him, freeing himself from his hands with a glare, though with his face it looked more as if he was pouting.</P><P>Kyuubi laughed at how adorable he was when he was sleepy and annoyed. Quickly correcting himself in his mind, Kyuubi could have slapped himself for thinking such things. <I>He is not adorable! Damn it Kyuubi, stop this nonsense! </I>Deciding now was the best time to tell the grumpy Soul his news; he got the attention of the bleary eyed blonde with a smile.</P><P>"Oh, and just so you know, there's a meeting today and you are required to go." Kyuubi informed, watching in amusement as Naruto quieted, taking in the information. Once in registered in his brain he practically cried at his words, flopping back down into his former position.</P><P>"The world hates me!" Finally getting the energy to face the world, the blonde moved over to his closet, picking out one of his formal uniforms. Quickly Naruto got ready, trying- and failing- to tame his hair, grumbling all the while as he pulled the comb through his hair again and again. Brushing his teeth and getting ready to change before he noticed Kyuubi's curious, leering look and instantly turned red, shouting curses as he retreated until he was hidden from view. Kyuubi smirked at how flustered he was, already ready and changed as he waited for the prince.</P><P>Moments later, Naruto was heading out the door, illusion in place, and his room once more hidden from human eyes. Kyuubi sighed and paused at the door, waiting for Naruto to realize what had to be done. It hurt him to have to do this to him, knowing it would hurt him much more than Kyuubi. Naruto turned around, confused as to why Kyuubi had stopped following him.</P><P>"What are you doing? Come on, let's go!" he urged, grasping Kyuubi's sleeve and tugging, looking adorable with his imploring eyes and confused smile. Kyuubi frowned, not wanting to kill the light in those eyes. He had clearly forgotten that Kyuubi was his slave, whether he liked it or not, and Kyuubi hated to remind him of this fact.</P><P>"My pretty…this is a formal meeting, and your father is bound to be there. I need to be a slave in front of them."</P><P>Naruto didn't seem to register his words for a few moments, but when he did Kyuubi wished he didn't have to see it ever again. His eyes died, and his hands dropped from Kyuubi's sleeve. Hurt and denial was evident within his face as he shook slightly, looking on the verge of tears. Kyuubi didn't know if they would spill through anger or helplessness.</P><P>"No. You're not a slave!" he cried, visibly upset. Kyuubi shook his head, silently disagreeing, knowing he had to be firm. Naruto bit his lip, hands shaking. Finally he gave in, shoulders drooping and hair falling into his eyes. Kyuubi frowned; making sure nobody was looking as they were halfway out the door before taking his face in his hands, making the young boy look him in the eyes.</P><P>"It's only for a little while, I promise. Trust me, okay?" Kyuubi smiled slightly in reassurance, waiting for a small one from Naruto before releasing him. Naruto turned, leading the way in a much more subdued fashion. Kyuubi followed the prince, posture low and eyes downcast properly. It was obvious which door was the one leading to the conference room. Arrogant royals were coming in and out, and there was a lot of conversation heard whenever the door was opened.</P><P>Naruto swung open the doors, revealing the mingling council. They turned at his entrance and some acknowledged him as he and Kyuubi moved over to the seat next to his father. Naruto sat, the perfect picture of beauty and grace, and Kyuubi kneeled beside him, watching the people through vibrant red hair. Nobody noticed the lowly slave, so he was free to watch and record any information he found valuable.</P><P>Naruto exchanged a few words of greeting with his father, polite as ever, before zoning out, not at all interested as his father conversed with another council member. Naruto knew the exact amount of how much he had to speak, how perfect he had to appear before he was allowed to disappear into the background.</P><P>Finally Minato called the meeting to order and they started their discussion. It was a rather interesting topic, but Naruto was not interested enough to respond to any questions directed to the council as a whole. Naruto simply zoned again, drifting off into his thoughts. Even in his dreamland, he managed to keep an interested face, nodding every once in a while even as his thoughts wandered to things Kyuubi couldn't decipher.</P><P>Kyuubi, meanwhile, was hard-pressed keeping his protective nature at bay.<I> Possessive nature,</I> his mind laughed at him, making Kyuubi push it away violently. Nearly every eye was dancing between Minato, looking professional, to Naruto. Many of the stares varied between curious and bored, but there were a good handful who eyed him with less pure intentions that infuriated the demon. Of course Naruto received looks! He was the King's son, and extremely beautiful. More so beautiful than handsome, but he had an exotic look about him. Being the sole son of the king, he was desired by many who wanted to become Queen or even King. It was not uncommon for two men to hold the thrones, even with demons homosexuality as commonplace. But one person looked more than Kyuubi thought necessary. Dark eyes were trained surreptitiously on Naruto, watching his every move. It wasn't obvious at first, he hid it rather well, but Kyuubi spotted it in an instant.</P><P>Kyuubi withheld a snarl as he identified the dark-haired man. Uchiha Itachi. Son of the Clan Head, Uchiha Fugaku, next in line for the head seat. The boy was watching the Namikaze as if entranced, a hungry, plotting look on his face. Kyuubi growled lightly in the back of his throat- he knew how the Uchiha family worked. They were demons, only pure blooded. The only reason they were not purged with the rest was because Minato knew them, and they held the tie to helping Minato hunt down the demons that had gone into hiding. If they wanted something, they would do everything in their power to get it, even if it meant trickery and fighting dirty.</P><P>He was pulled out of his thoughts when the meeting was disbanded, and he rose in synchronized time with Naruto, heading out. As he passed Itachi, he noticed the raven haired man grinning at Naruto. Instantly his polite behavior changed, completely ignorant of the other council members as his sole thought was on keeping this man away from <I>his </I>Naruto.</P><P>Itachi finally noticed his posture, the royal in him demanding to know why this slave was towering over him in such a way. Kyuubi pulled his lips back in a silent snarl as they locked eyes, glaring at him with fists clenched. Itachi looked momentarily startled, wondering what he had done to anger this man. As he looked over him, he noticed the way Kyuubi stood, shielding Naruto from view. One hand was moved slightly behind him, keeping contact with Naruto's sleeve just in case. Smirking, Itachi realized he had been caught. A silent challenge was issued between them, and Kyuubi left with a nasty sneer on his face.</P><P>Luckily they made it back to Naruto's room with no further problems, though Naruto was looking at Kyuubi with concern in his eyes. He looked an inch away from snapping, and Naruto couldn't help but search through all of his actions, wondering if he had done something to anger him. He never wanted Kyuubi to be angry at him.</P><P>Even with his concern reaching new heights, Naruto knew he shouldn't ask him just yet, not wanting to draw the attention of anybody walking through the corridors. Just as Naruto shut the door to his room Kyuubi was beside him, growling in his throat. Something in Kyuubi's instincts told him to be as close to Naruto as he could, reestablish that he was safe and Itachi could not take him away. Naruto was <I>his!</I> His mind was too filled with anger to yell at himself, seeing how possessive he was.</P><P>"Woah!" Naruto cried as he backed away, surprised by the sudden closeness of the demon. "What got you so fired up?" Not moving away this time as Kyuubi moved closer, refusing to let him be too far away. Naruto didn't understand why the redhead was so insistent on touching him, but didn't move away from him. Kyuubi had his arms around Naruto's waist, keeping him close to his chest- ignoring the confused stare from the blonde.</P><P>"More like who…" Kyuubi growled. Naruto shivered, feeling the vibrations throughout his strong chest. Blushing as he pushed those thoughts away, embarrassed to think such things towards a man he barely knew. Naruto tilted his head up to look Kyuubi in the eyes, his own oceanic blues curious. Naruto and Kyuubi stood there for a moment, their eyes warring as each tried to make the other back down. Naruto gave an exasperated sigh, pouting as he relaxed into Kyuubi's hold.</P><P>"Well who then?" he huffed. Kyuubi hated Itachi already- hated the way he looked at Naruto, but also hated realizing how possessive he was of the tiny blonde already. Just the simple question from Naruto infuriated the demon, and his thoughts just kept whirring around the same subject. Kyuubi felt his claws come out, intending to dig them into his palms, but met resistance before he could complete the circle. Confusion spread through his mind as he felt liquid start to drip around his nails. In surprise he glanced down, hearing Naruto cry out in pain and quickly releasing him. Bringing his hand up and staring in horror at the blood on his nails. Naruto stumbled back, hands moving to hold the injured area. Kyuubi watched him; he had hurt Naruto in his anger, and it broke his heart even if he hadn't meant to.</P><P>Naruto stared in shock at the older man before running to get the gauze, whimpering. Careful not to ask questions or Kyuubi might do something worse on accident. He tended to his wounds, glad they weren't too deep as Kyuubi had pulled away quickly enough. Watching it heal under his gaze until all that remained was tan unblemished skin once again. Kyuubi followed him, looking ashamed, and wrapped his arms around Naruto once again; chin finding a place at Naruto's shoulder. Sad, apologetic red eyes met his through the silver mirror. The pair sat there in silence, until Naruto closed his eyes with a sigh.</P><P>"I'm not angry at you; people do things on accident when they're angry. I just want to know what got you so riled up." Kyuubi was silent for a long time, running his hands absentmindedly over the spot he had harmed, trying to assure himself that Naruto was alright. Naruto's eyes softened, seeing how upset he was. Reaching to press his smaller hand over Kyuubi's, stilling the movement. Kyuubi looked up at him, searching his eyes in silence. Seeing nothing but forgiveness in his gaze, and realizing he couldn't keep this from him.</P><P>"Uchiha Itachi…" he sighed in response, teeth grit together. Naruto stared at him, completely quiet. Then, tiny little giggles started to shake his frame. They erupted into full blown laughter, so pure that even Kyuubi's anger was momentarily forgotten as he smiled. Naruto, failing miserably at trying to stop, turned and buried his head in Kyuubi's chest. It took a few moments for him to stop long enough to regain his breath, but when he looked up at the demon again his eyes were full of mirth.</P><P>"Lemme guess, you're angry because he was staring at me?" he giggled, wiping his eyes from the tears caused by his laughter. Kyuubi looked at him in shock, wondering how he could be so calm and even accepting of the fact. <I>He'd known the whole time? And he'd still not cared?</I></P><P>"Why don't you care? He shouldn't be looking at you like that!" he snapped slightly, angry not with Naruto, but with Itachi. He couldn't shake the thought that Naruto was <I>his, </I>pissed that some arrogant demon royal thought it was okay to stare at him like a piece of meat on a silver platter. Naruto's hands moved to Kyuubi's, gently intertwining their fingers and blushing as he did so.</P><P>"Kyuubi…he's been doing that for a few months now...I'm used to it." He said gently, looking into Kyuubi's eyes and trying to convey that it really didn't bother him and that Kyuubi was blowing it way out of proportion. Kyuubi's mind raced through multiple scenarios, knowing that when a demon wanted to mate with someone they had to go through a courtship. Had Itachi tried something? Was Naruto oblivious to his intentions?</P><P>"What?" Kyuubi roared, dropping Naruto's hands. His pupils shrank even farther, pulling himself taller until he towered over Naruto, instincts telling him to protect the blonde from this tainted rival.</P><P>Naruto shrank down, confused by the sudden behavior Kyuubi was displaying. A small part of him that he didn't understand preened at his behavior, knowing he had such a strong, possessive protector.</P><P>"Calm down, Kyuubi." He spoke softly, moving a hand out towards the fuming male. Kyuubi snarled, but didn't shrink away from the touch.</P><P>"That bastard!" he swore, clenching his hands into fists until his nails broke his own skin this time, healing and reopening in seconds. Naruto stared in horror, quickly uncurling his hands to stop him from hurting himself. Spreading their hands palm to palm and noting the size difference, trying to calm himself so that he could help keep the infuriated demon calm as well.</P><P>"He didn't do anything I swear! He just said a few things, I always stopped him when he touched me, I-" Naruto was cut off as the air froze, Kyuubi looking down at him and moving closer. Naruto trembled, not afraid of Kyuubi but afraid of his anger. The demon leaned down, close enough to share breaths.</P><P>"He touched you?"</P><P>Naruto stumbled over his words, hands moving uselessly. "N-Not like that! Just touching my arm, or waist!" Kyuubi remained still, a low growl in his chest. In his mind he was battling his instincts, almost like a conscious.</P><P><B>He touched our mate! He will pay!</B></P><P><I>Naruto is not our mate! And he stopped him!</I></P><P><B>He challenged us; he will try to take our mate!</B></P><P>Kyuubi hesitated, so influenced by his anger that he no longer bothered to correct himself on the mate part.</P><P><I>He will </I><I><B>never </B></I><I>take my mate!</I></P><P><B>Exactly. We will show him that he will not touch our mate! He will never steal our mate, he will hurt him!</B></P><P><I>Mate will never be hurt!</I></P><P>Kyuubi's growl intensified until it became feral, marks deepening and eyes bleeding to violet like they normally did when a demon gave in to his influences.</P><P>"He will never touch my mate!" He snarled, deeper and more violent than Naruto had ever heard him. The blonde was shocked into silence hearing the word 'mate', not sure what it meant and why it was being directed towards him.</P><P>"No, no he won't! You won't let him, will you?" Trying to ease him by agreeing with him. Kyuubi seemed to take courage from the fact that his mate believed in him, wrapping his arms around Naruto and picking him up with barely any effort. Naruto clung to the larger male, letting him do as he wished. Kyuubi set him down in the den like structure Naruto used to sleep in, moving away as if to leave.</P><P>"No! No Kyuubi you can't face him!" Jumping back up only to have Kyuubi gently but persistently push him back down, instincts telling him to keep Naruto where he was safe. Naruto panicked, not knowing what to do. Kyuubi would be killed if he left!</P><P>"Stop! Stop or…or I'll go to him!" Trying a more threatening approach. Kyuubi snarled so loud Naruto shrank back, and he pushed Naruto down, still gentle but much more forceful. Naruto fell onto his back, Kyuubi hovering over him.</P><P>"He will never have you! I will kill him before he touches you!" Naruto let his instincts take over, his mind shutting down. Baring his throat and laying limp beneath the man. Kyuubi lowered his head, looking comforted by the display of submission.</P><P>"Don't hurt him…I don't want them to hurt you…" instincts controlling his actions but his mind still telling him he needed to explain why Kyuubi couldn't protect him so openly. Tears budding in his eyes at the thought of Kyuubi being killed, the only person who made him feel safe and loved. Kyuubi seemed to snap out of it, seeing how upset he had made his mate. Finally aware enough to slap himself for calling him that.</P><P>He crushed Naruto to his chest, holding him in a hug as the poor boy cried. "My pretty…" he whispered, lips skimming Naruto's ear. Naruto relaxed, becoming still. It had been a while since Kyuubi had called him that…he had missed it. Kyuubi crooned at him softly, cursing himself for not seeing what logic could have told him.</P><P>If he attacked Itachi, in the very heart of the place that killed demons, he would be killed. Though it was touching to see how attached Naruto had become in their few days together. Naruto cried quietly, feeling foolish for doing so but grateful that Kyuubi had stopped.</P><P>"I don't want to be alone; I don't want you to leave me…" Naruto whimpered, and Kyuubi felt that same feeling from before resurface. He was blind to what his feelings were telling him, the signs that indicated that Naruto was more than just a Soul to him.</P><P>"I won't leave, I promise. Stop crying, shush…" Sitting up and pulling Naruto into his arms. Naruto sighed, wiping away the last few before resting against Kyuubi's chest.</P><P>"You called me your mate…what does that mean?" he asked innocently. Kyuubi froze, having it shoved in his face that he kept doing it instead of containing it to his thoughts.</P><P>"I'll tell you someday. I'm sorry for scaring you, it won't happen again. Just…stay away from him. Please." Naruto nodded, comforting the older man before he giggled suddenly, making Kyuubi look down at him with a curious expression.</P><P>"What are you laughing at?"</P><P>"Kyuubi, you never say please!"</P><P>"Yah! Shut up, you little-!"</P><P>Naruto kissed his cheek quickly, and Kyuubi's words died as he stared at Naruto. A blush spread across his cheeks.</P><P>"Little what?"</P><P>Was that an evil grin on his face?</P><P>"Uh…nothing, dear?"</P><P>Yup, it sure was.</P><P>"I thought so."</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>THANK YOU Lari18! You're the one who got this chapter in the works and reading your message over and over again finally made me finish and post it</P><P>Note: My writing style has changed a lot since the previous chapters. Someday when I am less indolent I will replace the first two chapters.</P><p style="text-align:center;"><I><B>Artistic-Chaos</B></I></P><P>"Naruto-Chaaan!"</P><P>A tousled blonde head was thrown up as one Naruto Uzumaki –Namikaze sprang up from sleep into a sitting position. Blankets bunched around his hips, bright orange as he had personally requested. Curling his hands into the softness he gripped hard until his knuckles turned white as bone and shook with the smallest of tremors. Exaggerated terror coated prettily defined features, and a sharp curse came spilling from downturned lips. A red head was soon rising, much slower, and turned groggily to look at the terrified prince sitting with slanted eyes in his bed. Crimson orbs, dark with sleep, raked over his expression and immediately panic settled like a weight in his chest. Wrongly assuming the worst, the last remnants of sleep soon vanished and one could clearly see the rapid thoughts that went swimming through his head.</P><P>"What's wrong? What's happening?" Instantly Kyuubi was moving, clasping his hands over Naruto's face gently. The red that suddenly sprang to the tanned cheeks normally would have had him smirking but not at the moment. For now, thinking that his pretty was in danger, he could care less about teasing the easily flustered prince. Cerulean blue eyes, swirls of purple showing from where the jutsu had worn off overnight, flickered up to make contact with the worried ones that hovered before him.</P><P>A shiver danced up his spine, and his lips formed a name that Kyuubi would realize would soon spell out hell for the younger Kitsune.</P><P>"Ino."</P><P>Kyuubi quirked a brow, slowly and almost reluctantly releasing his hold on the younger male and beginning to stretch languidly along the nest on the forest floor of Naruto's room. Panicking, Naruto threw himself at the demon, taking them to the floor with a rather loud thump. Two small hands clutched at broad shoulders as he straddled Kyuubi's waist. This position didn't go unnoticed by the full demon but he did not comment on it, still reeling from the sudden movement as Naruto began to bombard him with words. "You don't understand! She's crazy! Sure she knows the truth about me and is my best friend…but she's completely crazy!" Kyuubi chuckled and a smirk played at his lips seeing the wild look in those wide eyes.</P><P>"I'm sure she's perfectly-"</P><P>The door was kicked down, and Naruto let out a rather girly scream as he suddenly jumped to Kyuubi's side to hide in a ball there.</P><P>"-harmless?"</P><P>Kyuubi stared in shock as a lanky platinum blonde stalked through the doorway. Steely baby blue eyes- not nearly as mesmerizing as Naruto's, Kyuubi thought- swept instantly to the pair huddled on the floor. Completely bypassing Kyuubi, her eyes zoned in like a hawk on the trembling mass of golden tresses that were playing over the side of the other's male.</P><P>"Naruto-Chan! You switched rooms again!" Her flinty blues met the ones that slowly peeked out, and she grinned like a Cheshire cat. Naruto couldn't help it; his own foxy grin came running into play. Leaping up, he cleared Kyuubi in a bound and was soon standing before the girl.</P><P>At the exact same time, they let out high-pitched squeals and launched themselves into a tight hug. Kyuubi was honestly hard pressed to find where one ended and the other began. Quite disturbed by how quickly this had happened, he took the moment to scuttle up and stand. Cracking his stiff joints- hey, Naruto had disrupted his stretching- he blinked and the two were suddenly separated and staring at him. It was scary how much they resembled each other, standing there. They both had their left hand on their hip, and though Ino's was a bit different they had almost the exact same devilish grin stretching their visage. There were noticeable differences of course; Naruto's hair was more gold while Ino's was more platinum, Ino was almost an inch taller, and Naruto had spikes all over the place, down his neck almost to his shoulder, and then up to his bangs on his temples and the gravity-defying spikes up top. Okay maybe Kyuubi was getting carried away with this…</P><P>"Who is this handsome devil?" Ino purred. A coy expression flitted on her face as she spoke, eyes winking with laughter that cut the flirt in half. Kyuubi managed to withhold the sniff of distaste, even when Naruto laughed at her obviously fake flirt. Nudging her a little as if to replace rolling his eyes, the blonde prince dropped his head a little, face a colored pink that was visible even from that angle; Kyuubi thought it was precious. This time Kyuubi couldn't help it, and a full blown devilish smirk crawled over his handsome face. Standing comfortably under the sudden scrutiny, he met Ino's silvery blue gaze with his own smoldering red. Ino was still obviously listening to her blonde-headed partner, but her gaze never wavered under the demon's slightly darkened stare. In their minds, they each approved of the other.</P><P>"His name is Kyuubi…"</P><P>Ino laughed and dropped the act, striding over to him with a low slinking posture, circling him a few times. Flicking the collar that hung loosely around his neck, Ino suddenly turned rigid and whipped around. Turning to Naruto, Kyuubi could see her hands trembling as she clenched them tightly. Her nails dug into the palm of her hands, not enough to draw blood as Kyuubi had done yesterday but enough for her knuckles to turn a blotched pattern of white and purple.</P><P>"That bastard…he did this I'm guessing?" Though he couldn't see her, the rage in her voice was enough to even make Kyuubi take another look at her. Obviously she cared a lot for Naruto, no matter how strange their relationship was so far.</P><P>Naruto sighed as if used to this behavior. "Calm down sis, you know how he gets…he doesn't know me and you know it. I already got past my breakdowns I know you were going to ask." Ino's hands remained clenched, and the shorter blonde moved forward and took them into his own hands, gently uncurling them and giving her a pointed look.</P><P>"That's unfair and you know it Toto…I can't believe he doesn't know you inherited your mother's blood and not his!" Kyuubi had moved from behind Ino, feeling a bit uncomfortable with the whole situation. The bloodline part had Kyuubi paying more attention, remembering that Naruto had been interrupted before he had been told what his last name was. For their kind, last names meant absolutely everything. Minato Namikaze, a true human if he ever saw one, had very few of their kind in his bloodline. So Naruto's mother must be a very powerful pureblood for Naruto to be a full blown Kitsune. A powerful Kitsune at that…either way Kyuubi was definitely interested.</P><P>Naruto's eyes finally flickered, and his Genjutsu dropped to reveal the mesmerizing wine colored eyes. Although Kyuubi had always been partial to the red wines, he was now beginning to fall in love with that deep nearly black violet color. "I know sis…he is pretty blind, even for a human. Someday when I rule, this will never happen. I swore I would take you from your father and I never go back on my promises."</P><P>Ino looked about ready to cry, her baby blues swimming but she held them back like a true woman. Her voice, however, was raspy and choked as she spoke with a vehement hiss. "Someday is too far away, Toto. If he ever lays a hand on you again, I don't know what I'll do! He has made you take a slave into your possession, he abu-!"</P><P>Her words were cut short by a loud slapping noise. At first Kyuubi thought Naruto had smacked her, but in the next second he knew he hadn't. Naruto would never strike his best friend, and certainly never a female. A tan hand, delicately curved, was held firmly over Ino's mouth, and her steely eyes glared at him from where she was muted. Naruto's eyes held a desperate warning look in them, his gaze flickering to Kyuubi for a second. Eyes widening in understanding, and then narrowing in patronization, Ino waited until Naruto's hand had been removed from her face before she dared to speak. Naruto could easily hurt her, not that he ever would, but you never know what will happen when you succumb to your demonic side.</P><P>"You haven't told him have you," she hissed. Naruto glared right back at her, and it was so shocking to see on his open happy face that Kyuubi had to blink and look again. It was fierce, maybe even rivaling the full demon's glare. Of course Kyuubi had more practice, but the raw power and warning in those violet depths kept his mouth glued shut. Ino, however, was not so easily intimidated. Best friends always pushed their boundaries, but even Kyuubi wouldn't have gone up against Naruto at this point.</P><P>"Shut up, Ino. I can't and that's all there is to it. He would hate me…" Surging violet depths calmed into a sad hazy purple, as if the colors were changing shades according to his emotions. The platinum blonde sighed heavily, reaching a hand with purple painted nails up to her face to rub the bridge of her nose. There was a heavy, long silence that pervaded the air, and in that tense silent battle between Ino and Naruto, Kyuubi silently slipped forward to Naruto's side. A tan cheek turned a fraction towards him, showing he knew Kyuubi had moved, but his gaze remained heavy on Ino, and the girl knew it with how she held her shoulders stiff and tense. The tallest member in this little trio finally broke the silence, and like throwing a shuriken through a thin veil it ripped apart.</P><P>"Tell me what? Hate you for what? What am I missing here Miss Ino?"</P><P>Instead of turning to look at him, Ino caught Naruto's angry gaze. Growling angrily under her breath, she snapped out a cold answer without looking away from her best friend. "It is not within my rights to tell you. But I swear, Naruto, if you don't tell him by the end of this month <I>I will!</I>" Pale lips fluttered up in a snarl, and the air moved slightly as if disturbed. Ah, so Ino was part demon at least. Naruto snarled right back at her, and this time it was more like the air had been slammed to the side, and momentarily Kyuubi felt hard pressed to get enough air in his lungs. Ino swayed slightly but she remained standing, and the confrontation ended as quickly as it had begun.</P><P>"I agree to your terms." Naruto quipped, and drew himself up from his slight crouch. The two studied each other for a moment before Ino cracked a sheepish grin. A giggle escaped the golden haired Prince, and soon they were laughing, that kind of relieved laughter that just spills out and didn't want to stop. Sighing happily, they moved towards each other and tapped fists twice, hugging each other almost desperately after.</P><P>"Um…alright I'll just pretend none of that even happened. Answer, however, would be appreciated…?" Kyuubi quirked a brow at the shortest one of the group, tucking his thumbs into his pockets and staring quite heavily at him ready to use all of his powers to get the answers out of his pretty. Naruto flushed, moving away from Ino to rub at his arms awkwardly, leaving small discolorations wherever he pressed.</P><P>"Oh yeah um…well this is Ino Yamanaka, half Neko demon and my best friend. We don't always agree but well…we always make up anyways. We met when she ran away from her father, she was the only kid who knew who I was and didn't run to tell the guards she had found me. It was the first time I ever played with someone my own age; she was the first person I ever told about my lineage and um, other stuff. She's practically my sister!" He laughed a little at this before realizing he had been talking a bit too much. Or that could have been because Ino elbowed him softly with a big Cheshire grin on her face.</P><P>"Yeah, I met the squirt at an old civilian park; he was pretty damn smart to be able to escape all those guards when he was only seven! He was shy, but all I had to do was punch him in the arm and he was fine!" She laughed at this, holding her hands on her hips like it was something she was way too proud about. Naruto glared at her, but his features were softened with care despite the playful annoyance.</P><P>"That was a pretty hard punch! I was little!" he complained, and the glare only increased when Ino snorted with laughter and held her hand out to rest on her head, motioning it out to show she was about an inch or so taller than Naruto. Growling, Naruto glared at her, but Ino only smirked devilishly, knowing he would only wrestle with her and would never dare hit her.</P><P>Turning back to Kyuubi, Ino continued their story seeing as Naruto was grumbling about how she was being unfair and that his 'height was something I got from my Ma's side!'. "Well, the squirt and I were real fast friends. Eventually the guards tracked him down, and we had some pretty great fun running all over the village, smashing into stuff and being generally destructive. He had to go back eventually, but we kept meeting up. When my old man got too bad, I'd come here to the castle. The old bastard-" Naruto interrupted to clear things up, "She means my father," Ino rolled her eyes like it wasn't important before carrying on. "-never liked me of course, but then Naruto had the balls to stand up to him one day, which broke his own personal promise. Whole self-preservation bullshit and all, stuff like that. Secrecy needed to keep himself out of too much shit. Anyways, after that he realized that there was no keepin' To-To and I apart, he let me have my own room and maids around this place! Pretty wicked, but To-To likes to keep changing rooms to try and hide from me! Ya know ya love me, boy!" she cried, grabbing Naruto around the neck and rubbing her knuckles against his head.</P><P>Naruto keened, high-pitch and annoyed. Kyuubi instantly took two steps forward before he caught himself, feeling silly for being moved by the sound when it was just because he was being messed with. Ino, however, had caught the motion out of the corner of her eye. Naruto remained, thankfully, blissfully unaware of what had happened. Ino smirked, and Kyuubi felt his lips turn down in displeasure. What was going on in that brain of hers?</P><P>Releasing the blonde, Ino watched and noted how Kyuubi unconsciously relaxed once he was free from her hold. Silvery gray eyes widened in understanding, and she fought hard to keep from placing her hand over her mouth. Good god, was he really…?</P><P>Kyuubi finally met her eyes, and the understanding in them had his own mix of shock and confusion surface in his crimson eyes. So, he was in denial? Obviously they had a soul bond, and yet he hadn't figured it out. The great Kyuubi, a full demon Kitsune, was so far in denial that he couldn't recognize the signs? Ino snickered at that, earning herself a funny look from her best friend. Shaking her head, trying to compose herself, she took a deep breath and shook herself. "Anyways! So To-To as you probably know with your whole Prince-ness, the festival is tomorrow. I was going to blackmail you into going, but now that I've met handsome over there I decided that I wouldn't need to. It's a masquerade, so he won't have to act like your…like your…well anyways. You better be coming! I'll meet you tomorrow, usual spot, for Kimono shopping!"</P><P>Naruto opened his mouth to object, readily prepared to say that he had hundreds in his closet, but his best friend beat him to it. "And no, you can't just use one of your old ones! It's tradition to buy a Kimono with me before a festival! Eight years running, I am not breaking it! See ya, hotness. Later, To-To. Mwah!" She blew a kiss to Kyuubi and kissed Naruto's forehead, practically bouncing out of the room.</P><P>Kyuubi stared after her in shock.</P><P>"Did that just happen?"</P><P>Naruto just nodded quietly, his hand drifting up to gently touch at the spot where Ino had kissed his forehead, as if it were dear to him every time it happened. Kyuubi, despite being desperately curious about what Naruto had hidden form him in the long conversation- lineage was everything to Kitsunes and Demons, even Half-Demons- didn't ask instantly. He was seriously intrigued, but he wasn't going to ask, not yet. Shaking himself slightly, the blonde turned to smile brightly at Kyuubi, and it drew out the redhead's own small one from its hiding place.</P><P>"So…a festival huh?"</P><P>Naruto turned bright red, averting his eyes. Kyuubi chuckled and stretched languidly, using the motion to walk towards Naruto and brushing past him so close he could feel Naruto's breath on his neck. Said breath suddenly froze, and Kyuubi couldn't help the smirk crawling cruelly across his face. "I would love to accompany you, my pretty…"</P><P>It had been a while since Kyuubi had spoken those two words that had suddenly become precious to the Prince, and he only ever seemed to do it when they were alone. Naruto felt a shiver tingle down his spine, and a wild sort of light came to his eyes, obviously excited at this new turn of events. "Which means, of course, you will be accompanying me shopping as well? It seems we need to buy you a costume…" A devilish smirk, matching Kyuubi's, uncurled on his features.</P><P>Kyuubi's eager smirk dropped, realizing that he would have to go through the horrible world of shopping with Naruto and Ino.</P><p style="text-align:center;"><I><B>Artistic-Chaos</B></I></P>
