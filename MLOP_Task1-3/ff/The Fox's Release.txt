Gaara, a freaky kid with red hair, who could kill you with sand, turned out to be the host of the 1-tailed biiju, Shukaku. He knocked me out after a long fight between us. <b>(AN: In my story, Gaara won the fight)</b> After what felt like an hour, I finally woke up in my mindscape. I could sense that something was different. I looked towards the kyubbi's cage and saw something that scared me: I couldn't see his energy. I walked closer to his cage and looked inside. What i saw caused me to fly 10 feet into the air with a nosebleed. I saw a girl with blood red hair that had some black highlights. Her hair stopped just above her butt. She had blood red eyes that seemed to shine. she seemed to be wearing red lipstick. She looked so beautiful just by her face. Her body was absolutely stunning. She had an hourglass figure with long, skinny legs. Her skin was lighly tanned, just tan enough to have the sun shine off of it. It looked like she had whiskers. She had 9 blood red tails that were black at the tip of them. It seemed like she had Double D breasts. The girl caught me staring at her and did something that completely caught me off guard.</p><p><b>"What are you staring at,</b> <b>Kitsune-kun?"</b></p><p>I realized the voice.</p><p>"K...Kyubbi, is that you?" I couldn't believe how beautiful this girl was. 'There is no way she could be Kyubbi.'</p><p><b>"WHAT DO YOU MEAN I COULDN'T BE KYUBBI!" (AN: since they are in Naruto's mind, Kyubbi can hear his thoughts)</b></p><p>"K-Kyubbi...you're a g-girl," I said in complete disbelief.</p><p><b>"Yes, I'm a girl, Naruto. You never knew that"</b></p><p>"N-no, i didn't," I said as my eyes started to scope up and down her body. my eyes stopped at her DD's. She caught me and her face scrunched up in anger.</p><p><b>"EYES UP, PERVERT," </b>was all i heard her say before she started growling at me. To make her feel better, i did something not even I expected: i used my mind power to change my mindscape. i made her dark cell into a large field with a house in the center of the field and turned the seal on her cage into a necklace with a fox head-shaped pendant on it. She looked around and blushed slightly.</p><p><b>"Oh, Kitsune-kun, it's beautiful. Thank you."</b></p><p><b></b>I was actually able to see more of her. She had 2 pairs of ears: human ears and blood red fox ears with black at the tip of the ears. She had her human ears pierced 2 times, with blood red fox head-shaped earrings and black hoops. she also had her belly button pierced. She had her nails painted black. she wasn't wearing shoes, so i could also see that her toenails were painted blood red, but her big toes were black like her fingernails. I scanned up her body and what I saw made it difficult to control myself <b>(AN: In this fanfic, the chunnin exams wouldn't happen until ninjas become teenagers, and the Kyubbi and Naruto are both 16)</b> She was wearing only a blood red bra and black short shorts. my face turned as red as a beet and i turned away quickly.</p><p>"PLEASE PUT SOME CLOTHES ON," I yelled at her as my body started tingling. 'Frickin' hormones. I see one girl as beautiful as her and i nearly go crazy.'</p><p><b>"Who do you think is beautiful,</b> <b>Kit?"<br></b>_</p><p><b>Oh, cliffhanger... Will Naruto let the cat out of the bag or will Kyubbi never find out? Wait and see :D</b></p>
