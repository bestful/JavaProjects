was a normal and beautiful day in Konohagakure no Sato, where all the
inhabitants had a nice day and forgot their trouble. All but one, one
Uzumaki Naruto was running for his life, not far behind him was a
large group of villagers that tried to kill him, after they beat him
to an inch away from death. Now the obvious question arises, why was
a group of 15 people hunting down a boy that appeared to be no older
than 6 years old? The answer to that is the simple fact that Naruto
is what's called a jirinchiriu (sp?), he's the power of a human
sacrifice. Everyone in the village older than six new about it, but
the younger generation hadn't been told a single word, now a normal
person would ask why's that? This question would be answered by the
law the Sandaime Hokage of Konoha had passed down after the Kyuubi
attack. Yes that's right, the six year old Naruto was the sacrifice
the Yondaime had mad in order to safe the village.</P><P>Naruto
was running as fast as his short legs could carry him, right, left,
straight and then finally left, but this should proof to be a grave
mistake 'cause this was a dead end.</P><P>"Now
we got the monster..." "Kill it, it had killed our beloved
Yondaime."</P><P>Naruto
was frightened, normally he could outrun them but today they had
somehow caught up to him, and now he really was in trouble.</P><P>'What
should I do?! They 're going to kill me...I don't want to die yet!'
Naruto thought frantically</P><P>The
mob was hell bound on killing him, and responding to his bad luck
this time some ninja were there to. Five kunai had pinned him on the
wall and a chunnin was walking on the immobilize boy.</P><P>"Now
I'll kill ya and then the soul of the Yondiame can finally rest in
peace..." but this was as far as Naruto could understand him,
because his world went black and he found himself in a sewer, with a
voice calling out to him. Being the little child he was he walked
towards the voice.</P><P>After
a wile walking he came to a giant cage, held together by a paper
sheet with the kanji for seal on it. Naruto stared at the cage, from
where he assumed the voice came from.</P><P><B>"Hello
my boy...come closer..."</B></P><P>Naruto
stared at the big cage and then walked closer to it, looking in
wonder before speaking.</P><P>"Who
is there, do you want to hurt me too...please don't hurt me!"</P><P>During
his little speech he moved his hands in front of him in order to
protect himself. He hadn't met many people who didn't hurt him, most
people said they didn't mean any harm to him to stab him in the back,
literally. Behind the bars he slowly was able to see a woman, with a
dark red kimono with long sleeves, she was a sight to behold. Behind
her nine furry tails were waving around playfully.</P><P><B>"oh,
my dear...I'm so sorry for what you had to live trough. I wish I
could redeem myself and if I had any way to go back in time I would
do so...I'm very sorry..."</B></P><P>she
stopped speaking when she noticed that the small boy was hugging her.
Wait a moment he was hugging her, that meant that he had come on her
side of the bars, didn't he know, that now she could crash his mind
in a moments notice? Many thoughts along this line came in her mind.</P><P><B>'This
child, I'll help him...this dammed villagers shall see what they have
thrown away!'</B></P><P><B>"Listen
to me boy-"</B></P><P>"Naruto,
my name is Naruto not boy!" he shouted at her</P><P><B>"Listen
to me Naruto, at the moment your live is in uttermost danger, this
place is your mind scape and her we can speak without any pressure,
because during the time you're here the time in the real world is at
a standstill. Now for the more important things I'll lend you some of
my power to defend yourself, it's called the </B><I><B>chakra
cloak</B></I><B>
it will defend you, and protect you from any harm. After that I want
you to tell the Hokage that he shall come to seek me out, tell him
that I'll not harm him, I promise, ok?"</B></P><P>Naruto
looked at her for eternity, or at least for him it seamed like
eternity, before he nodded at her and was send back to the real
world.</P><P>A
chunnin was getting ready to slit his throat and deliver the killing
blow, when suddenly red chakra started to leak out of his body. The
attackers were feeling absolute terrified from the killing intent and
the presser the chakra was creating. The chakra was slowly covering
him and out of nowhere the chakra formed arms that attacked the
offenders, ripping them apart. The most frightening part although
were his eyes, they were blood red and had slits in them. The moment
the last of the offenders was taken care of Naruto collapsed on the
spot. The next moment the Hokage and a squad of ANBU landed beside
him.</P><P>"Inu,
take him to the hospital and make sure they treat him right, if one
of the doctors refuses to treat him, kill him on the spot." the
Hokage said to the ANBU with a dog mask, and gravity defying hair.
And with a short hai Inu had left together with Naruto.</P><P>"ANBU
take care of this mess.</P><P>The
remaining ANBU immediately created a few fireballs and burned the
remains of the villagers and ninjas to dust. Meanwhile Inu had jumped
via rooftops to the hospital, and after declaring that anybody, who
refuses to treat Naruto would killed on the spot, the doctors helped
him out of fear.</P><P><I>3
days later</I></P><P>Naruto
was slowly waking up, his eyes opened up and his cerulean blue eyes
stared at the white sailing, which he immediately recognized as the
hospital. Naruto thought back to the beating and winced under his
breath. After that he slowly sat up and look at the Hokage sitting in
a corner of his room.</P><P>'What's
oji-san doing here? Had he waited for me to wake up?' his thoughts
were answered by non other then the Kyuubi</P><P><B>"You're
right I've sensed him all the time you were unconscious he never left
your side. He really seems to like you."</B></P><P>Naruto
kept the mental conversation on for a few minutes about how his
oji-san could enter his mind scape. After that he yelled to the aging
Hokage</P><P>"Hey
oji-san...wake up!" The Hokage was rudely waken of his sleep and
saw a awoken Naruto sitting in his bed looking at him. To say he was
relived would be the lie of the millennia, he was more then glad,
that the son of his predecessor was alive and, as it seemed, hat no
wounds at all. He was glad and was of the opinion that everything
would turn back to normal in a few days, he couldn't be more wrong.
Due to the fact that Naruto's next words would shatter the world he
knew up today.</P><P>"Oji-san
could you please cast a privacy jutsu on this room, I've got a few
things I've to tell you and nobody else should know about that."</P><P>The
old Hokage was a little irritated but complied with Naruto's
request non the less. He flew trough a few hand seals and looked at
Naruto expectantly.</P><P>"Ok,
old man, first things first. I've to tell you that I've met with
Kyu-chan in my mind. And she wants to meet you, she is really nice
and helped me when the villagers attacked me. She also told me that
she wouldn't hurt you, she even promised."</P><P>"Don't
worry Naruto I believe you but there is a problem, I do not know of
any way to get in your mind without hurting you..." before he
could finish Naruto interrupted him and told him with a grin.</P><P>"Don't
worry oji-san. We've figured that out." and with this he hold on
the arm of the old man and both of them were drawn into his mind.</P><P>Sarutobi
found himself in front of a huge cage standing in the middle of an
forest. Behind it stood a beautiful woman with 9 tails dancing behind
her.</P><P><B>"Hello,
nice to meet you Hokage - san." </B>The
lack of any respect towards his title didn't startled him not too
much, he was after all talking to the Kyuubi no Kitsune and he
already was surprised, how polite the demoness was to him.</P><P>"Nice
to meet you too Kyuubi â€“ san."</P><P>Kyuubi
had a small smile playing around her lips, this mortal wasn't
disrespecting her, but showed the same amount of politeness she
showed towards him, an interesting person in deed.</P><P><B>"I
called you here in order to speak to you concerning young Naruto's
future. I'm sick of the way he is treated here, and I'll help him to
get strong and powerful, after I'm done with him he'll be a force to
behold. I'd like to take him on a extended training trip, from which
he would return the day he would graduate from your ninja academy."</B></P><P>The
Hokage was shocked, here he was standing in front of one of the most
powerful beings of the world, and contrary to popular belief, she
wasn't evil or sadistic, she was a nice person to talk. And to top
it, she offered to train the boy he had come to see as a grandson.</P><P>"I'll
agree to that, but I think it would be better if one of my ninja, a
jonnin would be with you, in order to..." he never managed to
finish the sentence seeing as a sneer from Kyuubi interrupted him.</P><P><B>"No.
None of these people will be with us. You've seen what they've done
to him. Apart from that it would be a pain in the ass to explain to
somebody why and how I'm training him."</B></P><P>Sarutobi
was quite for a while, he really wished to counter her, but he knew
that she was right. So he agreed to her and told her that he would
take Naruto shopping and would buy him everything he needed for his
training before he would leave the next day.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>Next
time: Naruto returns and becomes a ninja in the ranks of the leaf.</P><P>If
you have some suggestion for the harem please review me and tell me,
or pm me, but let me know. Now review please.</P>

<I>Jutsu</I></P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P><I>6
years later</I></P><P>A
lone figure was walking down the road, slowly he reached the gates of
Konoha, where two chunnins were standing on guard duty. He was
dressed in a blood red cloak and a black hat. He walked toward to the
gate and...walked through it. The guards didn't even move a finger,
in fact they were looking as if they didn't even saw him. Under the
hat, which covered his face, he had a small smile, which nobody could
see. He calmly walked to the Hokage tower and entered it through the
bottom and climbed the stairs.</P><P>In
front of the Hokage office he stopped and turned to the secretary. A
young woman, at the age of 22. She was quite good looking with her
shoulder length black hair, which flowed around her shoulders like
water, in absolute perfection and harmony. She was deep in thought as
she rearranged and changed a lot of appointments for the Sandaime.
Seeing that she hadn't realized that he was standing in front of her
desk he caught quietly in order to get her attention. She nearly
jumped out of her seat and got a heart attack when she looked up and
saw a, in her mind at least, total stranger standing in front of her.
The black orbs, which made up her eyes were fixed on the person
standing in front of her, one of her hands was already above the
hidden button for the ANBU, but due to her long year experience with
foreign customers or diplomacies she hadn't pushed it yet.</P><P>"May
I ask how I can help you Mr. ...?"</P><P>she
ask politely, 'cause she didn't knew anything about the man or women,
she couldn't say it, could be a politician or diplomat of an foreign
country here to speak about a treaty or anything else and any wrong
attitude she would show would fall back on here and she could loose
her job.</P><P>"I'm
an old friend of the Sandaime Hokage, Sarutobi. Six years ago we
agreed that I would come back to him around this time of the year.
Would you be so kind and tell him that his fox had come back?"</P><P>The
stranger spoke in a calm and comforting voice. In response she only
nodded before she pushed a button on her desk and told the Sandaime
what the stranger had told her. She expected to hear something a long
the lines of "some ANBU shall take him in" or "tell
him to wait a while" but nothing like that came, the response
was</P><P>"Send
him in Michiru, I haven't seen him in a long time!"</P><P>Naruto
entered the Hokage office and took his hat off, showing his sun
kissed blond hair still standing away in all directions and locked
eyes with the Sandaime. Sarutobi nearly got an heart attack when he
realized that in front of him was standing nobody else than Naruto
Uzumaki. After he got back his composure he looked at the young man
in front of him and spoke:</P><P>"It's
nice to see you again Naruto. I've greatly missed you, the village
was too quite without your pranks..." a smile found his way on
his face when he said that. But before he could question his young
charge any further he spoke up and interrupted him.</P><P>"Yeh,
it's nice to be back but before we go into any details, could you
please cast a privacy jutsu, a lot of things I've got to tell you are
only for your ears."</P><P>Sarutobi
was hesitant for a moment, what could the young boy, no man in front
of him was standing a man and not a boy, tell him that required such
secretly? However he decided to compile with Naruto's request and
did a privacy jutsu, and after the wands had stopped glowing Naruto
took a seat in one of the comforting chairs in his office. The Hokage
followed Naruto's example and set in his own chair before gesturing
the boy, by age only, to continue.</P><P>"It
really is nice to be back old man. I've learned a lot in these six
years. And thanks to Kyuu-chan I was able to train a lot longer then
just those six years. You see we trained in a special place in which
time flew slower than outside. So I trained not only for six years
but for eleven!" Naruto said with his big foxy-grin on his face.
"But that is not what I'd wanted to tell you so urgently. There
are a lot of changes that will affect me. To start I'm becoming what
is known as a master, but not any master, I'm becoming a master of
all, it isn't really about gaining perfection in all fields that
exist, it is just a few, seeing as I'll never have the time to even
if I'd be immortal, which I'm not. I've got to an level in nearly all
ninja related topics where you and your tree students would have a
hard time to be my equal in all your primes and I still have things
to learn."</P><P>Here
he spared a glance at Sarutobi, who was looking at him with wide
eyes, after all it wasn't every day that a 12 year old boy was
standing in your office and told you that he had surpassed you by any
 and all means.</P><P>"Naruto...do
you know - what you're saying? Alone for that to be correct in my
case , you would have to know more than thousands of jutsus, and all
the experience that you would have to have..."</P><P>But
he never finished his sentences as Naruto interrupted him again.</P><P>"I
know quite well what you want to say. And in regards of experience
you'll beat me any time, you've lived way longer than me, but
regarding the jutsus, there I'll beat you. I'm not limited to
thousands of jutsus, I know and have mastery over them, millions of
millions. I'm at a master level with nearly every weapon that is
known to mankind and a lot of weapons that had died out. I've got
summoning contracts with a lot of Animals and creatures that are
known and unknown to the world. Hell I even have made an name for
myself..."</P><P>This
time it was Naruto on the receiving end of the interruption, as the
Sandaime said:</P><P>"What
do you mean, what name have you made for yourself. And how in Kami's
name did you do all that in just eleven years?"</P><P>"Ahh
here you found the problem, and you're right normally, it wouldn't be
possible but due to an accident I've got all of Kyuu â€“ chan's
knowledge and all the knowledge off all my summons and even of the
once I have no contact with. And don't forget I can make a few
hundred thousand shadow clones without breaking a sweat. Why you
never used them for your paper work I never understood..."</P><P>Naruto
paused with his explanation due to the fact that Sarutobi's eyes had
widened and he had started to bang his head on his desk mumbling
under his breath about stupid old man and sadistic successors never
sharing their secrets. After that he created a few clones that
started dealing with the paperwork before he returned listening to
Naruto's tale.</P><P>"Ok...I'll
forget that scene ok? Where was I...ah yes I had made a name for
myself. I don't really like the name but I've got it so there is
nothing I could do about it the name I made for myself is: Bloody
King!"</P><P>Sarutobi
fell out of his seat. Naruto was the bloody King, the man that had
destroyed whole armies with the move of his hand! Various stories had
come to him about the Bloody King, a man with power, a man who wasn't
afraid of using said power but never ever to use it on the innocents.
The stories told about him varied but there was always a constant. He
was a killer without a doubt but he refused to attack or just harm
any innocent person. But still he was the first person in history to
gain a triple S rank in the bingo books with flee on rumor of being
in the <B>general</B>
area.</P><P>"Now
let's come to a happier topic. I know of my line age and why you
never told me and I understand. So seeing that I'm the last of my
clan I'll most likely have to practice polygamy and as far as Kyuu â€“
hime is concerned she hasn't got any problems with sharing as long as
the other person is willing to do them same. Yes Kyuu and me are
lovers, but before you say anything to that know that my decision is
final and nothing you say can change that."</P><P>Sarutobi
was speechless here, not only did Naruto know about his lineage but
he also got the Kyuubi â€“ the queen of all demons, the strongest of
them all â€“ as a future wife. First he wanted to object to them
being together but then what could he do?</P><P>"So
Naruto, I realize that you have done quite a lot and that you might
not want to be on a Gennin team but it would be good for you to do
something with people your own age group. I'll however inform your
Jonnin â€“ sensei about your abilities and about your alter ego."</P><P>"Um...old
man who is going to be Jonnin â€“ sensei?"</P><P>Sarutobi
looked confused for a moment before answering Naruto's question.</P><P>"Kurenai,
Kakashi, Asuma, and a few others like Genma, Ebisu and so on...why?"</P><P>"Could
you please place me on Kurenai's team then. I'm good enough with
weapons and ninjutsu. And seeing as Kakashi is the only one with a
Sharingan he'll have to teach the Uchiha and the boy is way to hell
band on revenge in order to work with him without putting up an act.
And last but not least I really like Genjutsu, given my abilities are
way beyond the chart but I still like it better then anything else,
apart from that with my summons I would be well suited for a tracking
team."</P><P>The
Hokage thought over it several times before he eventually nodded and
agreed with Naruto. The two talked for two or three hours before
Naruto walked towards his clan compound. The key he had gotten from
the old man Hokage.</P><P>He
entered his new home and created a few shadow clones and explored his
new home before he went to the kitchen to eat a little and went to
sleep with his Kyuu â€“ hime</P><P><I>the
next day</I></P><P>Naruto
was walking toward the academy and thought of who would made it in
his team, he overlooked the students and to him they all were weak
but compared to him nearly everybody was weak so he couldn't afford
do have an arrogant attitude but still they were going to be Ninja in
a few hours and there were two girls chatting about looks...</P><P>'What
the hell is wrong with this chicks? I men if they want to be real
ninja they 'll need a make over...man I'm glad I'm not the sensei!'</P><P>Naruto
walked in the room that he was told the graduates would be. So he
walked in slowly, after all there was no need to hurry, a bunch of
immature kids that would try to question him to death. He looked at
the class â€“ silence â€“ Naruto started wondering if he was in the
wrong room so he turned to the teacher</P><P>"Sorry
but I was looking for the graduates, that had passed the test
yesterday, Sandaime â€“ sama said I would find them here but I
presume I'm in the wrong room, I'll take my leave."</P><P>Iruka
woke out of his stupor and quickly, before Naruto could leave the
class.</P><P>"No,
your right here. This is the graduates class. The Hokage already told
me that you'll come today. I take it you already know on which team
you're on? Regardless of that please take a seat after introducing
yourself to the Gennin."</P><P>Naruto
noticed that there was pride in the voice of the teacher when he
called them Gennin. Normally a teacher would be glad to get ride of
the brats but his one, sure he was happy to get away from that but he
also had honest pride in his voice.</P><P>"My
name is Uzumaki Naruto, whoever will be with me on the team I look
forward to work together with you."</P><P>He
took his a seat in the back row and listened to the team placements.</P><P>(<I>A.N.:</I>
Teams are the same as in the canon, just Naruto is changed with
Kiba.)</P><P>Naruto
walked over to his teammates and spoke to them.</P><P>"Hey...we
have the whole lunch brake before we meet with our jonnin instructor,
how about we go out and eat lunch together and get to know each other
better, after all we're a team and I know next to nothing about you
guys and you sure have a few questions about me."</P><P>"S-s-sure
w-why not? W-w-where do you w-w-want to g-g-go?"</P><P>Shino
didn't speak he just nodded. Naruto looked at Hinata and noticed that
her self confidence was little to not existent and he vowed to change
that.</P><P>"Hinata,
um what is your favorite food?" He said in a soft voice.</P><P>Hinata
looked at her feet and said in a very quite voice.</P><P>"M-m-my
f-fa-favorite fo-food is D-d-dango."</P><P>Naruto
smiled kindly at her and send a glance to Shino asking him if it was
ok for him to eat dango to which Shino responded with a short nod.</P><P>"Ok,
I'll sunshine us to a restaurant, ok?"'</P><P>When
both of hem nodded he put a hand on their shoulders and sunshined
them to and Dango stand in the middle of Konoha. He walked in the
restaurant and his two team mates walked behind him. He sat down on a
big table and ordered tree big portions of dango and green tea. After
the waitress brought his orders he took a piece of dango and gestured
to his companions to serve themselves.</P><P>"Ok,
I'll start. My Name is Uzumaki Naruto a.k.a. The bloody King. Yes
this is me, I've been on a long training trip and learned a lot. I'm
on the way to get the title of master of all, but as of now I haven't
achieved that. My likes are Kyuu â€“ hime, my fiancÃ© and any other
woman I'll marry, due to the fact that I'm the last of my clan. I'm
quiet good at Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, Kenjutsu, Fuinjutsu, Taijutsu and
of course healing. My other likes are reading, gardening, Tea
ceremony, history and a few else. My dislikes are rapists, murderer,
slave traider and pepole who judge people without knowing them first.
My hobbies include training, helping my friends to which I hope to
include you in the near future, I also like sealing. My dream for the
future is to be a good clan head, a good father once I've got
children and being one of the best ninja in the history of Konoha."</P><P>After
his little speech he looked at his team mates and Shino continued
after, taking in the information he got from Naruto.</P><P>"My
Name is Aburame Shino, my likes are bugs, my finds, and my clan and
breeding bugs and taking care of the colonies. My dislikes are people
who treat bugs without respect and like you I don't like people who
judge people without knowing them. My dream for the future is to
breed a kind of bug that never was there in the past and to be a good
clan head."</P><P>The
two boys looked at Hinata, who seemed to shrink under their looks.
Naruto noticing that said in a calming voice.</P><P>"Hinata!
Please look at us. It seems you're a quiet and gentle one, and that
isn't anything bad. We are your team mates and we'll accept you the
way you are ok, so don't try to be someone you're not, ok?"</P><P>Hinata
looked up at him and then to Shino, who nodded agreeing to Naruto's
words. She took a deep breath, looked at them and then spoke.</P><P>"My
name is Hyuuga Hinata, my likes are flower pressing and the tea
ceremony. I dislike how my clan is run and the cage bird seal. My
dream for the future is to become strong and be a good clan head and
reunite the two branches of our clan."</P><P>She
managed to speak her whole introduction without stuttering and had a
small smile on her face. After the introduction they started to chat
about a lot of things from the time in the academy over Naruto's
trip, Kyuu-hime and stopped by there ideas for the test they were
more likely then not to receive from their sensei.</P><P>After
they came up with a plan and Naruto paid for their meal they went
back to the academy to meet their future sensei.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>Next
time: Kurenai's test and start of changing the Hyuuga clan.</P><P>Ok
here I've got some revives and I'm quite happy about it.</P><P>Sadly
I've got to say that there will be no femItachi in the story, cause
it wouldn't worked well with things I've planed for him.</P><P>There
are also a few women that will be in the harem for sure: Kyuubi,
femHaku, Kurenai and Anko</P><P>I'm
still open for further suggestions so just read and review, ok?</P>

Shino, and Hinata walked back to the academy, Naruto had offered them
that he would shunshine them to the academy, but both of them agreed
that although it was fast it would take time to get used to it.
Naruto realized that Hinata had already opened up to them. She was
laughing with them and giggled to the jokes.</P><P>A
few minutes later they were back in the academy an were walking in
the class to wait for their sensei. They just had to wait a few
minutes and Kurenai walked in on them and said</P><P>"Alright
Team 8 Meet me on the Training Ground 45 in 10 minutes." after that
she vanished into thin air and was gone.</P><P>Naruto
shrugged his shoulders, and whispered to the other two "Training
Ground 45 is on the other side of the village, regardless how fast we
run we wouldn't make it. I'll take us there but with a different
way."</P><P>Before
the two of them could say anything they dropped in a small black hole
under their feet.</P><P>"Don't
worry this is a jutsu I created, it basically pulls us into a
separate dimension, so the rules concerning time and space of the
'real' world don't apply here. By the way don't let go of me, you
would get lost and it's a pain in the ass to search someone in here!"</P><P>Both
of them couldn't come up with anything to say at this very moment.
Neither Shino nor Hinata could come out of their stupor the world
they were in was magnificent and in every aspect unique. All around
them it wasn't just darkness, there was a nice scenery with trees,
grass, lakes...everything was in different shades of grey and black.</P><P>Kurenai
was waiting in front of the training ground and leaned with her back
of against one of the big trees.</P><P>"How
long did you gave them to get here Kure-chan?" asked the women on
the other side of the tree, her hand was holding Kurenai's, one of
her fingers was circling on the tip of Kurenai's hand.</P><P>"I
gave them 10 minutes to get to training ground 45, so if they're good
at tracking I expect them to be here in 20 minutes top. They're still
Gennin and should restore to asking people in order to find this
area. So what should we do until they get here...koi."(<I>A.N.</I>
koi should mean love, if I'm wrong please someone correct me)</P><P>Anko
turned around and interlinked her finger with Kurenai's and leaned
in to kiss her, Kurenai closed here eyes in anticipation (<I>sp?</I>)
of the kiss. However the moment there lips touched there was a flash
and both of them jumped back and looked where the flash came from.
There 5 meters in front of them stood Naruto with a flash camera
pocketing a little camera. Hinata looked shell shocked, sporting a
blush redder than any tomato could ever hope to attain. Shino's
expression couldn't be told, but he stiffened and his body was tenser
then usual.</P><P>The
two Jonnin were looking at them with eyes, wide like dinner plates.</P><P>"Ne,
Ne Kurenei-sensei, that was one hell of a motive for my cam, thank
you very much..." Naruto was grinning and was looking at the
picture he had taken.</P><P>The
next moment dozens of kunais flew at him, he looked at Anko and
flashed her one of his famous fox grins and winked with his hand, all
the Kunai stopped midair and dropped to the ground. Anko couldn't
really comprehend what just happened and blinked once, a grave
mistake. In the time she blinked Naruto vanished from where she was,
the next thing she remembered, could only be described with one word:
pain. She screamed out and every one looked at where she was.</P><P>Naruto
sat on her back, pulling out a cigarette and light it with a little
fireball in his hand. Kurenai turned, with the full intention to run
at Ankos side, however she froze when she felt an enormous KI on
here, and heard Naruto's voice.</P><P>"Move
one muscle and I'll slit her throat...so, I'd like to ask you a few
questions and you'll answer them truthfully...clear?" He looked at
Kurenai and glanced at Hinata and Shino.</P><P>Kurenai
swallowed hard and whispered a clear, Shino and Hinata nodded. Anko
on the other side couldn't really move in fear of being killed by the
floating swords, she pressed a weak hai out of here mouth. Naruto
smiled and spoke in a calm voice, maybe a bit too calm</P><P>"Ok,
now that we have agreed on that, first things first. Kurenai â€“
sensei were you and Anko-san planing on teaching this team together?"</P><P>"Hai,
we were. I specialize in Genjutsu and tracking. So naturally my
weakness is close range combat Anko on the other side excels in this
area." Kurenai was forcing here breath down and tried to get a hold
on herself, as long as she would answer his questions Anko was safe.</P><P>"'Ah...very
good answer. Ok, next question. It is obvious that you and Anko-san
have a relationship with each other. Assuming that she would be on
missions with us, how long and how...developed is you relationship?"</P><P>Anko
couldn't help but blushed at his question, it was only for the sword
treating to kill her that she didn't kill him herself. Kurenai was
blushing and started to play with her fingers but answered non the
less.</P><P>"We're
together a-about 3 years and we have a f-fully de-developed
relation." She was nervous and visibly embarrassed.</P><P>"Ok,
that is basically everything I wanted to know, now you can ask your
questions, you to Anko-sensei, my swords won't harm you but they'll
kill you if you move or try to do anything against me. However you
can speak as much as want. So got any questions?"</P><P>Anko,
not letting such a chance pass her, started by yelling her questions
"WHO THE HELL ARE YOU!! AND FOR WHAT FUCKING REASON ARE YOU DOING
THAT!!??"</P><P>Naruto
chucked 'This will be one hell of a team!'</P><P>"Ok.
My name is Naruto Uzumaki a.k.a.. The Bloody King, yeah right that's
me. Now you see if we had our introduction the normal way and I said
that you wouldn't believe me! But now you've seen that I'm quite
capable of something. At first I planned to do this to Kurenai-sensei
in order to make her believe my claims. I honestly didn't think that
you 're Kurenai's lover. By keeping her on distance and you as
hostage with abilities she had no knowledge of she wouldn't risk your
life to find out what I'm capable off. You two being together could
have brought trouble to us on missions if you'd been a young couple
and overprotective of each other. I hope you see my point here..."he
paused for a few moments before he continued "Now. Anko had the
hardest part in all of that, seeing as Shino and Hinata knew
beforehand what I planned and knew hat I wouldn't hurt our sensei..."
here he flashed both women his foxy grin "Um Anko â€“ sensei,
you're a late student of a certain Snake, right?"</P><P>Anko
bit her lip but nodded. Naruto could see the pain of betrayal and
fear in her eyes. Fear, of what Naruto might do to her, if he was
anything like the most people. Anko felt his hand on her back moving
in an easing pattern.</P><P>"Now,
there is no need get tense Anko-sensei, your nothing like that Snake.
I assume that your quite good at Snake jutsus but you can't summon
them because of Manda's loyalty towards Orochimaru, right?"</P><P>Again,
everything Anko could do was nod. She felt stupid that this kid,
title be dammed, was listing her weaknesses. Naruto ignored the
tensing of her back and continued.</P><P>"As
I've told Satrutobe-ojisan, I hold a lot of summoning contracts,
known and unkown to mankind. Orochimaru holds the <I>normal</I>
Snake contact, however I can give you the right to sign the demonic
Snake contract. There is only one condition to that, the first time
you try to summon one of this snakes you do it next to me, because
I've to promote you in order to be accepted by them. Now I'll let you
free, but neither you nor your lover can do any payback to me or the
other two or our deal is void. Deal?"</P><P>Anko
didn't took long to think about it. If it was a bluff there was no
deal, and she could make his training living hell, if he told the
truth she would be allowed to sign a summoning contract stronger than
Orochimaru's. For her it was a win win situation.</P><P>"Deal!"</P><P>Naruto
jumped of her and his swords vanished into thin air. He stood in
front of them and flew trough a few hand signs, there was a puff of
smoke before he gave Anko the summoning scroll. Anko blinked a few
times, she was sure it had been a bluff, but who was she to complain
about a new summon? Anko took the scroll, unrolled it and signed it.
After that she looked at Naruto expecting him to say some thing but
he just gave her a wink to go ahead. She pulled all her chakra in it
and did the jutsu.</P><P>There
was a big smokescreen and after it cleared there stood a snake at
least double the size of Manda.</P><P>"<B>Who
dare to summon me?" </B>The
beast questioned. Anko wanted to say something but Naruto beat her to
it.</P><P>"Anko
here has. I have given her permission to sign your contract for she
is the only loyal snake wilder in Konoha and my future teacher."</P><P>The
summon looked at Naruto and smirked.</P><P>"<B>As
you wish Naruto-sama. We will aid her in peace and war. Anything
else?"</B></P><P>"Yeah.
If possible could you reduce the chakra needed to summon your kind?
After all she hasn't my reserves and to summon you would be quite
pointless if she couldn't fight after doing so."</P><P>The
giant snake nodded its head, and shortly after that vanished with a
puff of smoke.</P><P>After
Anko got over the shock of having a new summoning contact with
stronger and better snakes than her former teacher Naruto apologized
to both Kurenei and Anko for his methods of proving his point and
getting information of them. The teachers decided that it wouldn't
do any good to use the normal standards on this team and due to that
just ignored the test and started talking about the abilities of each
other and in what they should train. Naruto hadn't forgotten about
his goal to change the Hyuuga clan but before he could do anything he
had to take Hinata out of harms way and needed information on the
clan itself. Now that was easier said than done, he couldn't be
Hinata's bodyguard or shadow although it would have been the
easiest way. He settled to let her tell him about her family, how the
clan was run, who made the decisions and what the rules were. The
rest of the team listened interested, after all knowing about a team
mates clan could help them in the future. Naruto also gave her a
bracelet insisting that she would always wear it. The whole team was
confused about it but Naruto insisted on it, and none of them was
stupid enough to question it or refuse it, after all, Naruto was the
bloody King and they assumed that there was more to it then it
seemed.</P><P>xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</P><P>Do
NOT forget to give me feedback on this...please....at least one of
you ....please...;) thanks</P><P>R&R</P>
