Thought</P><P>"....."
Speech</P><P>"Yah~!"
Naruto yawned, stretching behind the Hokage's desk. He cast a glance
behind him, his blue eyes reflecting the setting suns light. It had
been a while now since he had become Hokage. All his precious people
were safe, and he had the respect of the village he always longed
for. Smiling, Naruto rose from behind his desk, his 9 tails swishing
behind him. Casting a look to the side, the tails rose to rest
comfortingly against his back.</P><P>'No...
Life can't get better.'</P><P>Happy
with his own thought, Naruto moved to exit his room and see his
secretary.</P><P>"Ne
- Sakura chan!"</P><P>"Hokage
sama!"</P><P>Naruto
smiled at the pinked hair woman who had risen from her desk as soon
as he had addressed her. Their friendship had come a long way since
their early childhood days. He had gotten over his infatuation of her
the moment he realised the love he had felt was that of a family
member. Yes he had loved her - but as a sister. As soon as he was
able to make that distinction earlier on in his life, their
friendship had grown and strengthened more than he thought it ever
would. However, that was then, and this was now. He was Hokage now,
and he once again was beginning to feel the strain of isolation that
the title of Hokage had brought him.</P><P>"Oi
- Sakura chaaaan.... It's Naruto da yo..."</P><P>Sakura
only smiled apologetically with a small laugh. Some things change -
and some things wont... Naruto was thankful for small mercies when
presented with them.</P><P>"It's
late - you should be going, he's waiting for you."</P><P>Sasuke.
Naruto knew that Sasuke was once again back within the outer
boundaries of his village. He knew because Sakura had come to him -
had begged him not to pursue him anymore. She had told him that
Sasuke wanted to rest, to not have to look over his shoulder anymore.
She said he was finally ready to settle down. Naruto had told them
that they could have a nice place by the river - between the Konoha
memorial site and the main gates. He was not heartless after all -
and believed in new beginnings.</P><P>"Thank
you Naruto."</P><P>Sakura
moved forward and gave him a strong hug. Naruto returned the embrace
before letting her go, allowing her to gather her things and leave to
head home. Where her loved one was waiting for her.... Naruto sighed
softly, turning to leave Hokage tower.</P><P>'What's
up Naruto?'</P><P>Naruto's
body began walking on auto pilot, his mind elsewhere.</P><P>'Nothing.'</P><P>A
soft chuckle echoed in his mind.</P><P>'You
can't lie to me.'</P><P>Naruto
smiled to himself.</P><P>'Perhaps
not...'</P><P>Naruto
began to focus on the well travelled road he was taking, and all the
familiar faces he passed rather than Kyuubi's question. He was still
getting used to Villagers who seemed to fall over themselves to meet
him. It was a stark contrast to all those years back, when he was
almost always avoided. However, now, when he was greeted by people,
he always greeted back - smile in place as always. The village no
longer seemed to fear him or his new appearance - all seemingly
oblivious to the 9 fox tails waving behind him of their own accord.</P><P>Naruto
felt himself sighing again. Walking through the streets, he was
noticing something which hadn't been bothering him as much until
recently. There were couples holding hands, kissing, or just making
googly eyes at each other.</P><P>This
problem had first come into focus when his friends began to get
married. He was happy for them - he truly was. He lived for seeing
his friends happy. However, he had been alone in that department all
his life. He had never even had a girlfriend. The chances of getting
someone now had increased slightly - but... He was still waiting...
And his heart was sinking with each passing moment.</P><P>Naruto
opened his apartment door, stepping inside and locking it firmly. He
had refused to move house after becoming Hokage. This place held so
many memories for him - and he was giving them up for no one. He
shrugged out of his Hokage coat, laying it to rest on the couch as he
made his way to his bedroom, shedding his clothes as he went. He
didn't fancy eating - all he wanted to do was go to bed.</P><P>In
only his boxers and t-shirt, he flopped on his bed, face down. The
tails of Kyuubi rubbed soothingly over his back.</P><P>"Mmm...
Thanks Kyuubi..."</P><P>Naruto
didn't know when he had fallen asleep, but he was wide awake now -
haven been woken up by something or someone laying kisses on his
neck, and hands soothing his back. He tried to still his breath and
beating heart, trying to sense who was above him. It only took him a
moment as his body began to relax feeling the familiar chakra,
however his mind quickly filled with confusion.</P><P>"Kyuubi?"</P><P>All
he received was a low chuckle. Naruto shifted turning to face the man
above him, with golden eyes and dark spiky red hair. Naruto only
caught site of a few red tails which began to dance just outside of
his vision, confirming his initial assumption. He was about to speak
when Kyuubi leant down, placing his lips lightly against Naruto's.
When Naruto didn't respond, Kyuubi pulled back ever so slightly to
look into the questioning blue orbs of the man bellow him.</P><P>"Why?"</P><P>Kyuubi
only smiled, showing slightly pointed canines.</P><P>"Are
we back to this question? You know why... You're... my special person
Naruto and..." Kyuubi's smile faded into a more serious look. "I
don't like seeing you sad... Not when I can give you what you
seek...."</P><P>Naruto
didn't know what to say. He was so shocked he didn't register the
words that were already leaving his mouth.</P><P>"I
don't need your sympathy Kyuubi."</P><P>Kyuubi
growled and snapped his jaw shut in anger. He was not offering
sympathy. He was offering his everything to him. To think Naruto
would even think he would offer anything else - anything less.</P><P>Naruto's
eyes locked with Kyuubi's, and he instantly regretted his words. He
could see the hurt in his eyes, and it made his heart ache and twist.
Kyuubi had offered himself, and Naruto had shot him down without a
thought.</P><P>Kyuubi
shifted pulling away, but Naruto's hesitant hand on his arm and face
made him stop.</P><P>He
looked back down, studying Naruto's face and eyes. The confusion and
wonder of the situation were clear in his eyes, but what was clearer
was the hope lying in them.</P><P>Naruto
knew that Kyuubi had always been there for him. They had formed a
special bond over their time together in his body. And so, due to the
amount of time that had passed it was only naturial to think that
their shared experiences shaped their unique relationship. Always
growing and adapting.</P><P>"Kyuubi-
I-"</P><P>"Shhh....
It's ok..."</P><P>It
was Naruto who initiated the second kiss, and Kyuubi let him take his
time. He let Naruto's hand burry in his hair and trail down his back.
The feeling made Kyuubi's back arch into the touch and his tails
encompass them offering their warmth. Naruto moaned softly into the
kiss, deepening it. Kyuubi used his hands to return the affection,
bringing his hands in the blonde hair and trailing them down Naruto's
neck in gentle caresses.</P><P>Breaking
the kiss, Kyuubi moved in to nuzzle Naruto affectionately whilst
Naruto moved his arms around Kyuubi's waist holding him close.</P><P>"I
think I'm falling..." Naruto breathed, placing soft kisses on
Kyuubi's neck.</P><P>"No
Naruto..." Kyuubi whispered, locking eyes with Naruto. "I
believe we're flying...."</P><P>With
their hearts unspoken declarations, they spent the rest of the night
together, holding each other close until the morning rays bathed
their joint bodies in warming light.</P>
