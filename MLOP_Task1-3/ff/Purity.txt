Naruto/ Female Kyuubi</p><P>Chapter One.</p><P>Contact.</p><P>Uzumaki Naruto awoke. He stared at the
ceiling for a while before slipping into some clothes. He frowned as
he noticed his orange jumpsuit was getting to small for him.</p><P><I>I was getting tired of orange
anyway.</I></p><P><B>Me too.</B></p><P>Naruto, a trained ninja, jumped at the voice pulling a Kunai from
under his pillow he began to inspect his 2 room apartment.</p><P><I>Nothing out of
the ordinary, must have imagined it.</I></p><P>Sighing he went to his kitchen and pulled out a cup of dried instant
ramen. Oh how he hated ramen. If he had more money he could afford
foods that were better for him. He put some water to boil as he went
into the the living room. He still called it that even though his
kitchen and living room were one room. He felt a tug at his heart
when he saw the old Team 7 picture. Snickering at how everyone
believed that fake smile they saw day in and day out. He ate his
ramen in silence before going out to buy new clothes. Something that
he seldom did.</p><P>(At the store)</p><P>Naruto, a true shinobi at heart, new how to dress like one. And this
time he could stand his ground to the villagers instead of taking the
orange jumpsuit they threw at him. Stepping in the store. Naruto went
to the back where he saw a pair of black shorts, a long sleeve
fishnet shirt, and a black short sleeve shirt to go over it. Buying
multiple outfits exactly like this he left the store.</p><P>(Back at home)</p><P>Naruto laid on the bed, staring at the ceiling contemplating why he
was the one that had to bare this burden. All because the stupid fox
got pissed off and attacked the village.</p><P><B>I'm not stupid!
You're stupid! Asshole...</B></p><P>Naruto sprang into action he knew he had heard something this time.
He grabbed the closest weapon near him. A katana Kakashi had gotten
him for his birthday. In his mind he heard chuckling but he couldn't
seem to find anything wrong with his apartment.</p><P><B>You wouldn't
know how to use that if you tried.</B></p><P>Knowing the odd voice was right naruto stopped to contemplate the
matter before he doubled over in pain coming from the seal.</p><P>When he woke up, he noticed that he was in his bed. Surprised by this
he hopped up and ran to his living room to see the most beautiful
women he had ever seen in his entire life.</p><P>Red hair flowing down her back, to match her red eyes. She was
watching the TV when the boy came bolting into the room. He stammered
for a while before he could make out some words.</p><P>"Y-y-you're..."</p><P>The women turned her head making eye contact before speaking.</p><P>"Kyuubi, nice to meet you."</p><P>She turned her head back to the television before she heard a
horrible crack. Turning her head back around she noticed Naruto was
lying on his tile floor of his kitchen with a pool of blood forming
around him. She winced. That must have hurt.</p><P>(Hospital.)</p><P>When Naruto came around he noticed the same woman from his apartment
in a chair next to his bed, staring out the window. She didn't bother
to turn her head this time before speaking</p><P>"Concussion.."</p><P>Naruto nodded, and as he did he felt some drainage around his head
and felt awfully dizzy. Looking out the window he noticed it was
beginning to get dark before speaking.</p><P>"Why are you here?" he spoke with malice and hate, the same tone
of voice as those damn villagers.</p><P>Kyuubi turned around and narrowed her eyes at him.</p><P>"Don't want me here? Fine! I'll just-"</p><P>"Wait." Naruto hated to admit it but he knew no-one would come
visit him in the hospital. He could enjoy the company right?</p><P>"I'm sorry." He muttered.</p><P>Her eyes softened as when he spoke.</p><P>"It's ok. I can understand your surprise. You shouldn't be awake,
its not very healthy for your body to be working while your
conscious."</p><P>She leaned over and pressed her lips to Naruto's, as his eyes widened
in surprise she pressed to fingers to a spot on his neck, effectively
knocking him out.</p><P>"Good night, Naruto-kun."</p><P>She picked him up and walked out the door, heading towards the boy's
apartment, knowing she would have some explaining to do the next
morning.</p><P>(Aforementioned morning)</p><P>Naruto woke up remembered everything that had transpired. For some
reason he didn't even want to get out of bed. He rolled over to see
a sleeping Kyuubi lying on the floor curled into a ball. He got out
of bed and draped the cover over her, it was the least he could do
for her after she took him home.</p><P><I>Wait a second!
She knocked me out after she kissed me!</I></p><P>Thinking back, Naruto had realized that was his first kiss. He smiled
a bit and got dressed in his new clothes. He noticed a set missing
and looked back to see Kyuubi with them on. <I>Purring,</I> The scene
melted his heart. The Great fearsome Kyuubi no Kitsune, Was <I>Purring
in a ball</I> on his bedroom floor. He smiled a bit more and went out
to see what todays tasks were. He wrote a note, addressed to the
woman on the floor.</p><P>Dear Kyuubi,</p><P>I don't know why you're here. But I don't really care. My cell
number is on the fridge if anything happens. I trust you know how to
defend yourself against intruders and stuff. I'll be home around 5.
Theres ramen in the cabinets, if that doesn't suit you heres 40
dollars for grocery's.</p><P>Sincerely,</p><P>Naruto.</p><P>With that he walked out to the Hokages tower, located not too far
from his house.</p><P>(Hokage tower.)</p><P>Most people believe that in Konoha, the Hokage just barks out orders
and people run around and obey. Well being a ninja isn't really like
a day job. You are more of a freelancer after you reach the chuunin
rank. When you go look for a mission, theres a bulletin board and
space after that for a signature. There is a brief description of
the job, and what class it is. After that you could leave until you
would be briefed on the mission. Needless to say. Most ninja got up
early to snatch the best jobs. Naruto was no different. Walking to
the wall he noticed a decent B class mission. Naruto scribbled his
name down before leaving the building. He mulled the whole idea of
having the Kyuubi manifested in this realm when he came upon a
revolution. He. Needed. A drink. He walked inside one of his favorite
bars to see Shikamaru at a booth.</p><P>"Oi, Shika."</p><P>Shikamaru looked up from his book, to see Naruto decked out in a new
outfit.</p><P>"Decided to dress like a ninja, ne?"</p><P>"Whatever, you know the situation."</p><P>And it was true, Shikamaru was one of the few people that saw beyond
the mask and actually knew Naruto for Naruto.</p><P>"I Suppose.."</p><P>Shikamaru looked up to see naruto with a faraway look in his eyes.</p><P>"So whats wrong Naruto?"</p><P>Naruto broken from his trance spoke.</p><P>"Well you know about...my tenant."</p><P>"Yep."</p><P>"Well you know its a she right?"</p><P>Shikamaru looked up from his drink.</p><P>"Didn't know that."</p><P>"Well it's true. She's also out of the seal, actually she is at my
house right now."</p><P>Shikamaru did nothing more than sigh.</p><P>"God dammit Naruto, you really are to troublesome you know that?"</p><P>"I suppose."</p><P>Thats when Naruto's cell phone started ringing. It read: <I>HQ</I></p><P>"Well mission briefing gotta go!"</p><P>"Whatever, cya round Naruto"</p><P>(Hokages room.)</p><P>"Uzumaki Naruto, chuunin of the village hidden in the leaves do you
accept?"</p><P>"Aye Hokage-sama, I accept."</p><P>"Very well, ready your weapons, you depart at 0600 tomorrow.
Dismissed."</p><P>Naruto exited with a well placed salute before he continued on his
way to his house.</p><P><I>Well, I didn't
get the mission I wanted, but at least I get to see Sasuke-teme.</I></p><P>Thats it, I'm out. Here's a preview I guess.</p><P>"<I>But, I have
to go!"</I></p><P>"<I>Then I'm
going with you!"</I></p><P>"<I>Why?"</I></p><P><I>Kyuubi whipped
around with a sad look in her eye.</I></p><P>"<I>Because I
have to."</I></p><P>Kay,review and I type understand? Good.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br>Ugh, Guys Im really sorry I Havent updated sooner. I Promise that this chapter will be mind-blowing
for all who reveiwed. Once again sorry.
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>In a hotel
about 5 hours away from Konoha lay two people in a single bed. Naruto
rolled over to see Kyuubi was in fact sleeping soundlessly. He
silently jumped out of the bed through the window to the top of the
roof. Sitting down he revisited the events of the day. It had in fact
been a good one. Kyuubi whined as usual, they stopped for ice cream
on the way. Kyuubiâ€¦Now that was an odd one. Her mood swings were a
force to be reckoned with. She was dangerously powerful butâ€¦he
couldn't help feel a sense of helplessness coming from her. She was
annoying as hell with her loud mouth, and her bright red hair, and
her crimson eyesâ€¦and her lips plump and--- .Naruto shook his head.
He had to focus on his mission. Infiltrate the sound village as a spy
and bring back the defense layout to Konoha.</p><P>He
smirked.</p><P>Sasuke
Uchiha would be one of the top targets in the attack.</p><P>No doubt
he would be the one to kill him.</p><P>You see
little did Sasuke know, Itachi was already dead. His revenge had been
foiled by Naruto's sheer will to live. They had burned the body and
spoken of it no further. That's when Naruto truly became a ninja.
He and jiriaya had his from summoning ceremony that night. They and
Gamabunta drank sake for roughly 9 hours strait until Gamabunta gave
up. Naruto continued reminiscing until he felt a feeling of dread
well up in his very soul. Flipping down he landed on the fire escape
he looked through the window at Kyuubi on the bed. Tears of Despair
falling down her cheeks. His eyes widened at the sight until he
realized.</p><P><I>She's
crying for meâ€¦</I></p><P>Not used
to this kind of situation Naruto walked into the room. Where he was
glomped by a certain redhead.</p><P>"WHERE
THE HELL WERE YOU, I WAS WORRIED SICK!"</p><P>He looked
up into her eyesâ€¦captivating and hypnoticâ€¦crimson the color of
destruction butâ€¦also the color of passionâ€¦of romanceâ€¦ofâ€¦</p><P>"BAKA-NARUTO!
PAY ATTENTION!"</p><P>"I'm
sorry what?"</p><P>Kyuubi
smiled to herself. She knew at times how seductive she could be, it
was in her nature. This kid was way too innocent to understand what
was going on. She could see it in his blue eyes. Innocence and
peaceâ€¦almost like an oceanâ€¦she felt all of her worries melt awayâ€¦</p><P>"N-nothing
Naruto-kun, don't worry about it."</p><P>(The next
morning.)</p><P>The couple
approached the sound village, and the sight of it was quite
surprising. Naruto had expected it to be some dark and dank place
with the sky always cloudy, instead it was quite the opposite. There
we men building houses and the like. Women shopping and cooking.
Shops lined the main-street; children played in the yards that kinda
thing. They walked up to the gate and introduced themselves.</p><P>"Halt,
state your business."</p><P>Naruto
looked up to see a man no older than 20 asking the questions.</p><P>"Just
refuge ninja from Mist sir. Looking for a home."</p><P>"Hmmm,
what's your name?"</p><P>"Momochi
Gendo and this is myâ€”"</p><P>"Girlfriend,
Yuki."</p><P>"Young
couple eh? Alright here are your temporary headbands until you're
evaluated by the Otokage and placed onto a squad. Here are your keys.
Apartment complex 4 Room 115. Enjoy your stay."</p><P>They both
bowed as they entered the village, out of earshot Naruto's face
went Hinata red as they strolled the stands.</p><P>"That
wasn't part of the plan <I>Yuki</I>."</p><P>Kyuubi
just smirked; she had him wrapped around her finger. Now all she had
to do was jump him when they got back to the apartment, rip his
clothes off andâ€”</p><P>Jab.
Naruto continued poking her in the head.</p><P>"Hey
umm, are you dead?"</p><P>She
grinned. A mischievous glint in her eye.</p><P>"Naruto-<I>kun.</I>"</p><P>She
latches on to his arm and looks up to see the poor boy almost
exploding with embarrassment.</p><P>She
giggles before running ahead of him, to the dango stand.</p><P>Naruto
grinned too. Kyuubi may be annoying but she sure was fun to be
around!</p><P>Sorry
about the late update, Had no idea where to move with this story. I
think I've found my direction though.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>A/N:
Someone said something about Naruto being 14. Who said he was 14?
He's 17.</p><P>Naruto sat
on a rooftop in the village of the hidden sound, scoping out possible
entrances and exits to the village of the hidden sound, but something
caught his eye. Through his binoculars he could see a red-headed
women stepping out of an apartment and onto a balcony.</p><P><I>Dammitâ€¦</I></p><P>He
continued on with his work even with the constant distraction of
Kyuubi being wellâ€¦attractive. He sighed, packed up his work and
bounded home before coming in contact with a fist.</p><P>He looked
up to see an angry Uchiha Sasuke looking down on him.</p><P>"What
the fuck do you want?" Sasuke asked.</p><P>Naruto
spat and Sasuke visibly softened.</p><P>"Listen,
I'll only say this once. I'm sorry for what I did, but this
villageâ€¦.doesn't deserve it. If you have something to say to me,
by all means say it."</p><P>"I'll
fucking kill you Sasuke and you know itâ€¦you're crazy, mad,
hell-bent on revenge."</p><P>Sasuke
sighed.</p><P>"Narutoâ€¦look
in the window about 55 meters west, and 22 meters off the ground."</p><P>Naruto
scoffed as he did what he was told. There were kids. Three maybe
four, it was kinda dark. All sleeping soundly. By the time he looked
up to Sasuke for an explanation Sasuke had already answered.</p><P>"Adopted."</p><P><I>Sasukeâ€¦</I></p><P>"Iâ€¦gave
up on Itachi. It was foolish, I played into his trap. He set me up to
become just as he had."</p><P>"W-w-what
stopped you."</p><P>Sasuke
smiled as he looked into the eyes of the man who was the closest to
family he had.</p><P>"Before
I left to get Itachiâ€¦I saw the murder of those kids' parents.
Itachi did it. He wrote a message in their blood. 'When you have
the same eyes as me Sasukeâ€¦' I almost went for him that night
before I saw those kids' huddled in their bedroom. crying. But not
out of Sadness or despair. But out of gratefulness to this village.
Everyone pitched in a little to help outâ€¦ Narutoâ€¦before we end
this little discussion I have a question to ask you: Do you know what
set's a man apart from a boy?"</p><P>"Yeah,
the ability to make responisb---"</p><P>"Wrong."</p><P>"What
separates men and boys is simply that a man has to have something to
cherishâ€¦protectâ€¦I have my childrenâ€¦what do you have?"</p><P>And with
that. Sasuke was gone.</p><P>Naruto
frowned as he landed in his bed next to a sleeping Kyuubi.</p><P><I>Hmmâ€¦what
do I have?</I></p><P>He was
broken from his thoughts as he felt Kyuubi declare his chest as her
pillow.</p><P>Naruto
smiled.</p><P>Perhaps he
did.</p><P>When
Kyuubi woke up, she found Naruto gone.</p><P><I>Probably
off doing something stupid.</I></p><P>She
sighedâ€¦.it was happening. She knew she was falling for him but she
couldn't let that happenâ€¦â€¦ could she?</p><P><I>No. If
</I><I><B>he </B></I><I>were to find out. He'd kill us both. I've
got to start the ritual soon otherwiseâ€¦</I></p><P>She smiled
sadly.</p><P><I>We'll
dieâ€¦</I></p><P>Mmmm,
there we go. I might just stick with a chapter like this everyday.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>I got a
fucking review from one of my favourite authors (John hamsta.) So you
know I'm going to write, but first a little review response. Excuse
me if I don't say your name instead of, that guy, because I am
offline as of now /.</p><P>Somebody
said that I made Sasuke come off as a good guy easily (Which I'm
proud of.), they also said why Sasuke didn't make a non-aggressive
pact with Konoha.</p><P>Answer: I
was really thinking about doing that, I really was but I realized
that it wouldn't work simply because Konoha and Oto have different
views pertaining to each other. For example: Sasuke wouldn't leave
or even perhaps be able to because he is an officer to orochimaru (I
haven't forgotten about him, this will be addressed later.) But a
genin or even a. chuunin would be able to say "I quit, later."
And leave the village with little to no consequences. On the other
hand Konoha goes apeshit if a genin with no knowledge of the inner
workings of the village decides he doesn't want to be apart of it.
It's simply that in my story, or in all of my stories. I've
always wanted to portray the sound village as freedom.</p><P>Someone
said: <B>he</B> was the Shinigami. No <B>he</B> may or may not be
introduced in this chapter. All I can say is that, he is an OC (To
some degree, he's never been introduced.) And he wants to kill them
for reasons that will be revealed later.</p><P>On with
the story.</p><P>They had
been 3 months in the village of the hidden sound before Konoha had
attempted to reach them. The conversation in whole had been very
disappointing. A Kage bunshin of Tsunade had met him outside the
village.</p><P>She looked
through her henge and proceded with her message.</p><P>"How far
have you gotten on the map Naruto?"</p><P>Naruto
chuckled.</p><P><I>A bit
strait to the point baa-chan</I>.</p><P>He saw the
serious look in her eye before he realized.</p><P><I>Iâ€¦have
to lieâ€¦</I></p><P><I><BR></I>"I
had to destroy it. I had ANBU scoping me, and I wasn't going to
take that risk with her here."</p><P>Understanding
passed the Godaime's face before she realized.</p><P><I>Waitâ€¦who
the hell was 'her'â€¦</I></p><P>"Naruto
don't go running off and falling in love with enemy ninja you
hear?"</p><P>Naruto
chuckled.</p><P>"She's
not an enemy, but she's not far off. Later granny."</p><P>With that
Naruto sprang off, as Tsunade turned to leave howeverâ€¦</p><P>A kunai
landed in a tree after cutting through the Bunshin's neck.</p><P>A Uchiha
Sasuke jumped down from the trees.</p><P>"Hmmmâ€¦dobe."</p><P>Kyuubi was
sitting on the floor drawing seals which roughly looked like two
circles connected. She hummed while she did, so much that she didn't
notice the blonde Ninja jumping in and taking a seat on the couch
behind her. She rose from her work and walked backwards before
landing in Naruto's lap. Turning in agitation, she saw the smile
that grazed his features, and found she was soon wearing one as well.
Wrapping his arms around her waist Naruto saw that the seals were
almost complete. She leaned back into his shoulder ,one thought going
through their minds.</p><P><I>Some
thingsâ€¦can wait.</I></p><P>A man
shrouded in shadow chuckled as he watched the scene through his
crystal ball.</p><P><I>They
think that will by them more timeâ€¦I pity themâ€¦</I></p><P>He
chuckled as he rose from his seat.</p><P><I>Too
badâ€¦I already have control over them. </I></p><P>He
squeezed his hand tight, as a glowing red eye stuck through the
darknessâ€¦</p><P>Kyuubi was
too caught up in the moment to notice anything until Naruto said
something.</p><P>"Kyu..ubiâ€¦.getâ€¦Sasukeâ€¦."</p><P>Pulling
her from Cloud 9, she looked down to see Blood coming from Naruto's
mouth.</p><p>"Noâ€¦"</p><P>She ran to
get the only person who could help them.</p><P>Sasuke was
cooking for his kid's as he heard a banging on his door.</p><P>"Someone
get the door."</p><P>A young
girl's voice answered.</p><P>"Daddy
its Aunt Kyuubi!"</p><P>Putting
the eggs on a platter, he took of his: 'Number one chef' Apron
before heading off to see what she needed.</p><P>When he
arrived at the door he saw a dishevelled and crying Kyuubi.</p><P>"What's
wrong, what happened!"</p><P>"Naruto's
hurt, badlyâ€¦"</p><P>"Let's
go, Shinji you're in charge."</p><P>Naruto was
hyperventilating on the small love seat when they came flying through
the window. His vision started to go whiteâ€¦</p><P><I>Soâ€¦thisâ€¦is
how I dieâ€¦</I></p><P>"H-heyâ€¦Sasukeâ€¦I'm
glad you're here."</p><P>"What
did you do dobeâ€¦"</p><P>"That's
not important nowâ€¦there's a box at the top of the bookshelfâ€¦get
it for me."</p><P>Sasuke
thinking its some kind of medicine, grabbed the box before returning
back to Naruto, who was cradled in Kyuubi's lap.</p><P>"Open
itâ€¦"</p><P>Sasuke did
as he was told and gazed in the box.</p><P>There were
thingsâ€¦lots of things...photos of people back in Konohaâ€¦Iuka's
headbandâ€¦Even Tsunade's necklaceâ€¦</p><P>"Hehâ€¦you
didn't think I'd die without writing a will did you?"</p><P>Sasuke
shook his headâ€¦.this couldn't be happening.</p><P>"Noâ€¦"</p><p>"Sasukeâ€¦"</p><P>"No. noâ€¦</p><P>"Sasuke
shut up!"</p><P>"You're
not dying, you can't!"</p><P>Naruto
smiles sadlyâ€¦</p><P>"Oh but
I can, and I don't think I have much time leftâ€¦soâ€¦listenâ€¦"</p><P>"I leave
everything I ownâ€¦in Kyuubi's name save what's in that boxâ€¦I
want her to stay here, watch her for me Sasukeâ€¦"</p><P>Sasuke
noddedâ€¦</p><P>"I'm
finally a man huh Sasuke?"</p><P>A tear
rolled down Sasuke's face.</p><P>"Yeahâ€¦yeah
you areâ€¦"</p><P>Naruto
looked up at the crimson goddess which he was in the lap ofâ€¦</p><P>"Sasukeâ€¦give
us a moment."</p><P>Sasuke
took this opportunity to try and find a medic, leaving them alone.</p><P>Naruto
chuckled.</p><P>"Hey
youâ€¦"</p><P>Kyuubi bit
her lip to try to stop crying.</p><P>"Hey
yourselfâ€¦"</p><P>Naruto
paused.</p><P>"You
knowâ€¦I never got to tell youâ€¦"</p><P>Kyuubi's
face became grave, fearing what he was about to say.</p><P>"â€¦that
I was madly in love with you."</p><P>Kyuubi
struggled to maintain control.</p><P>"Shhhhâ€¦Shhhhâ€¦.it's
okâ€¦"</p><P>Naruto
closed his eyes as he reached into his pocket and pulled out a little
black boxâ€¦handing it to the crying girl.</p><P>"What?"
She seemed confusedâ€¦</p><P>"Open
itâ€¦it'sâ€¦for you."</p><P>Kyuubi
obliged and found the most beautiful ring she had seen in her life in
the boxâ€¦a gold band with one shining ruby in the middleâ€¦</p><P>The dam
broke loose and all of the girl's emotions poured out.</p><P>"HOW CAN
YOU DO THIS TO ME!"</p><P>Naruto
reached up in stroke her faceâ€¦he tried to get a good look for it
would be the lastâ€¦</p><P>"I'm
sorryâ€¦I'm so sorryâ€¦Iâ€¦was going to ask you after the ritualâ€¦I
wantedâ€¦to make you happy. I wantedâ€¦to have a family like... I
never hadâ€¦"</p><P>She kissed
him on the lips, unlike their last kiss which had been to Knock him
out in the hospitalâ€¦</p><P>"Narutoâ€¦I
love youâ€¦.I always didâ€¦"</p><P>Naruto
sighedâ€¦as his world went completely whiteâ€¦</p><P>"That's
niceâ€¦"</p><P>She felt
him go limp in her armsâ€¦just as she thought she could cry no more
tearsâ€¦she found her self leaking through the eyesâ€¦</p><P>She stood
as she felt a man enter the roomâ€¦the same manâ€¦who did this to
herâ€¦to Narutoâ€¦to themâ€¦</p><P>"Hello
Kyuubi, how are you today?"</p><P>She spat
with venom and hate and disgust.</p><p>"â€¦fatherâ€¦"</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>She
stood as she felt a man enter the roomâ€¦the same manâ€¦who did this
to herâ€¦to Narutoâ€¦to themâ€¦</p><P>"Hello
Kyuubi, how are you today?"</p><P>She
spat with venom and hate and disgust.</p><P>"â€¦fatherâ€¦"</p><P>The man cloaked in a
long white cloak strode through their apartment, their home. His
intentions were clear as he pulled out a wakazashi he had crafted for
this purpose. His revenge would be complete in a few moments, and
then he could turn to ash for all he cared.</p><P>He raised his sword.</p><P>Chuckling he continued
his stride towards the distressed girl on her knees.</p><P>She closed her eyes,
memories of her lover began to flow through her thoughts.</p><P>He grinned as he brought the blade down upon her neck.</p><P>When Sasuke appeared he
was wielding kusanagi in a defensive position over Kyuubi.</p><P>"Leaveâ€¦.nowâ€¦."</p><P>Sasuke smirked.</p><P>"Or what big shot?"</p><P>Oh was the man happy to
oblige.</p><P>Sasuke was flung from
the apartment building onto the streets below, a couple of broken
ribs was as serious as his injuries were. Suddenly ninja appeared
around him.</p><P>"Sasuke-sama!" The
chorused as one collective.</p><P>"Stay away from
there, evacuate the area." He ordered.</p><P>He didn't want any
more civilians to be injured. That man was serious business. He
realized that the man didn't actually touch him, puzzled as to how
he was flung through the wall he looked up at the hole that had been
created to see a floating Kyuubi gasping for air.</p><P>"Any last words,
sweetheart?"</p><P>Kyuubi chuckled as she
remembered the only loophole that would stop him from exacting what
was rightfully his by the demonic tomes.</p><P>"Optime Duos Mortim."</p><P>The man dropped her
instantly, what would giving her and herâ€¦toyâ€¦a few days do?</p><P>"Tell him 14 miles
west of here at midnight in 3 days, or elseâ€¦"</p><P>Pictures of the
children of the village being slaughtered plagued her mind.</p><P>"Kukukuâ€¦.Ciaoâ€¦"</p><P>Naruto sputtered back to life as a black substance foreign to his
body exited through his mouth.</p><P>(That night.)</p><P>Naruto and Kyuubi both
lay in Naruto's room that night. Both awake and cherishing the time
they had together. Kyuubis head lay on Naruto's chest and his arms
wrapped around her small frame. Both were thinking of the current
situation they where in.</p><P>"Kyuubiâ€¦"</p><P>Two red eyes looked up
to meet two blue ones.</p><P>"I love you."</p><P>A touching moment,
regardless Kyuubi rolled her eyes at the boy.</p><P>"No shitâ€¦"</p><P>She nuzzled into him
more before she continued.</p><P>"Naruto?"</p><P>"Yeah?"</p><P>She smiled in his chest
as she spoke her next words.</p><P>"Letsâ€¦.let's have
the babyâ€¦ok?"</p><P>"But your dad will
kill meâ€¦literallyâ€¦"</p><P>She frowned as crystal
tears made its way from her eyes into Naruto's bare chest.</p><P>"I know butâ€¦if we
do figure out somethingâ€¦if we do beat himâ€¦please?"</p><P>Naruto grimaced.</p><P>A baby? He wasn't
ready for a baby. He would be a horrible father, hell he didn't
even have parents to begin with, how was he supposed to know how to
be a parent? Irresponsible. Immature. That's what people called him
and generally he thought that's what people didn't expect from
parents.</p><P>He looked down at
Kyuubi, her red eyes glowing with happiness.</p><P>He didn't know how to
be a parent!</p><P>Guess he'd have to
learnâ€¦</p><P>"â€¦Okâ€¦"</p><P>He closed his eyes as a
girlish squeal filled his apartment.</p><P>Kyuubi had gotten up
and pranced around yelling and screaming about things that needed to
be done. When she had gotten over her excitement she had noticed
Naruto was sitting up in bed. A sad look plastered on his face. She
snaked behind him putting her chin on his shoulder as she wrapped her
arms around him.</p><P>"Let's think of
baby names!" She exclaimed.</p><P>Naruto generally didn't
have much else to do.</p><P>"Okâ€¦what do you
want for a boy?" He replied.</p><P>"How aboutâ€¦uhâ€¦.hmmmâ€¦"</p><P>It became fairly
obvious that Naruto would have to think of names.</p><P>"I was thinking
something that gives people a secure feeling, like a person they can
trust...something likeâ€¦Orochimaru!"</p><P>Naruto face faulted.</p><P>"What if it's a
girl Naruto? We already have a boy name!"</p><P>Zoning out Naruto
stared at the ceiling.</p><P>"I want something
simple if it's a girlâ€¦Rei or Hitomi."</p><P>"Those suck."</p><P>Naruto turned around
and stuck out his tongue.</p><P>"You suck."</p><P>Kyuubi suddenly angry
about the situation.</p><P>"Wellâ€¦not anymore I
don't"</p><P>She released him and
prepared herself for bed.</p><P>Naruto slapped his head
in his stupidity.</p><P>Curse mood swings.</p><P>Been a while since I
updated you may be happy to see this.</p><P>Made this chapter nice
and fluffy, the real training/action should start next chapter I
suppose.</p>
