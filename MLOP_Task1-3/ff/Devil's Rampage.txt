WHAT'S THE BIG IDEA," he shouted.</p><p>Two Chuunin had taken place of a water puddle behind them.</p><p>"I missed," the one on the right said.</p><p>Naruto jumped with a kunai in hand towards the one who had apparently tried to kill him when a figure knocked him out the way and ripped off the two Chuunin's weapons and armor and clothes.</p><p>"Enter the demon, Naruto-san. She can help you. Nee-chan can help anyone," the figure said before disappearing again.</p><p>Naruto was puzzled at this, but Kakashi took advantage of the pause and threw kunai at the Chuunin, who dodged nimbly.</p><p>Naruto just sat on the ground where he had landed. The man had had black-red-orange hair, a black and red left eye and a green right eye, stood about 6' tall, had an opened button-up shirt revealing a well muscled body and a Yin/Yang symbol with a pulsing red line around it. He carried a katana that had a Yin/Yang symbol guard and a purple on black two-handed hilt.</p><p>Then Naruto stood to see he had missed the entire short skirmish.</p><p>Tazuna started to sweat and Kakashi asked, "Why were those two obviously after you?"</p><p>"You know Wave's story, Hatake-san. I'm trying to build a bridge to gain our freedom, Gatou doesn't want that," Tazuna replied soberly.</p><p>"Ne, Sensei, who was that man that stopped me," Naruto asked.</p><p>"I don't know, but he called your <i>issue</i> 'Nee-chan', so I'm guessing he was <i>her </i>little brother."</p><p>"But it's not a she, is it?"</p><p>Sakura Haruno was getting fed up and said, "WHO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?"</p><p>"Kyuubi no Kitsune, the demon that ruined Naruto's life," Kakashi replied.</p><p>"That's impossible! The Yondiame killed it, didn't he?"</p><p>"Nothing can kill Kyuubi, but she can be sealed. That is what Yondiame-sama did."</p><p>They continued in silence and when the sun fell, they set up camp.</p><p>Naruto fell asleep and was transported to a sewer, in which there were neon arrows that he followed to a cage.</p><p>"<b>Hello, child," </b>a voice boomed from inside the cage.</p><p>"Kyuubi?"</p><p>"<b>Yes, child, I am Kyuubi no Kitsune, the Demon Lady of Hell!"</b></p><p>The fox was doing a weird pose inside the cage.</p><p>"<b>Onto more serious matters, why are you here?"</b></p><p>"Some guy said to contact the demon within and called you Nee-chan."</p><p>"<b>Ot</b><b>ōto talked to you!"</b></p><p>"Yeah, was that bad?"</p><p>"<b>I miss his food. Otōto gave the best meals before that snake came in between our family."</b></p><p>"Snake? You sound like you're talking about Orochimaru."</p><p>"<b>That's because I am. Tell Otōto to come to Konoha with us or we'll follow him everywhere."</b></p><p>"He kinda left after pushing me away from those two guys."</p><p>"<b>Oh."</b></p><p>"I have feeling he'll show again soon, however."</p><p>Naruto tore off the seal on the cage and left without another word. Kyuubi gaped at him.</p><p>The sewer disappeared and Kakashi was standing over him with Sasuke and Sakura holding him to the ground.</p><p>"Naruto, calm down," he shouted.</p><p>Naruto opened an eye and took his hands and legs gently away from his teammates before observing his surroundings.</p><p>"You sent up a massive chakra flare that brought us into this cave," Kakashi explained.</p><p>"I think I know what lives here," Naruto said.</p><p>He let Kyuubi have control and shouted, "Otōto! It's me, Nee-chan! Where are you?"</p><p>Naruto's eyes went red, so nobody thought to criticize Naruto for calling himself 'Nee-chan'.</p><p>The man from earlier came out and hugged Naruto tightly.</p><p>"Nee-chan, I missed you. I'm sorry, but I couldn't save our family. It's just you and me," the man said.</p><p>"I apologize, humans, for my sister's actions. That <i>snake</i> tricked us into fighting Konoha. I am Anthrias, Kyuubi's youngest brother," He introduced.</p><p>"I am Kakashi Hatake, that is Naruto Uzumaki, the one on my left is Sasuke Uchiha, and the girl is Sakura Haruno," Kakashi said.</p><p>The other two bowed and Anthrias walked out of the cave with us and came back to camp to stay for the night.</p><p>Naruto got a better look at him and saw no tails, but two white fox ears. He never slept, keeping out on patrol and a hand on his sword's hilt.</p><p>The next day, Naruto created a Kage Bunshin and thought, <i>"Kyuubi, can you get inside the clone?"</i></p><p>"<i><b>Yes, thank you, Naruto-san," </b></i>she replied.</p><p>The clone morphed from a Naruto to a 6' tall, redheaded, red-eyed demoness with nine tails and fox ears.</p><p>Kyuubi bowed to Naruto deeply and said, "Thank you, Naruto-san."</p><p>"It's no big deal; just don't get sealed away again."</p><p>They smiled and walked to join Team 7 and company.</p><p>"Ne, Naruto, is that-," Kakashi began to ask.</p><p>"Yes, it is." Sasuke was thinking, <i>'I must have her for myself. That dobe doesn't deserve to have anyone.'</i></p><p>Kyuubi and Anthrias snapped their heads towards Sasuke and Anthrias smiled evilly.</p><p>"Don't even try, mortal fool. I'm not the weakest of my family. I never was," he said.</p><p>Ten tails came into sight behind him. They were all white with black tips.</p><p>"What? You thought Kyuubi was the strongest demon? She isn't, and I'm not either. That position belonged to Tou-san. Wait, if I'm the only living male… oh no," He groaned.</p><p>"What is it, Anthrias-san," Kakashi asked.</p><p>"I'm the new clan head of Maō. The Council finally got some power over me."</p><p>The rest of the trip continued in silence until Anthrias perked his ears up.</p><p>"Stay quiet, and watch your back. There is chakra in this mist," he said.</p><p>Just as he said this, a humongous zanbatou flew out of nowhere and lodged itself into a tree. Then there was a man on top of it suddenly.</p><p>"Momoichi Zabuza," Kakashi said.</p><p><b>End Chapter.</b></p><p><b>A/N: I hope this chapter goes over well. I was listening to Hollywood Undead and may feature them in this next chapter. READ AND REVIEW!</b></p><p><b>Ja Ne, MasterofAnarchy</b></p>
