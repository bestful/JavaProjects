<p><u>Prolonge</u></p><p>Everyone knows how the Kyuubi was sealed into Naruto, but for those few who don't I'll go back to his beginning the day of his birth:</p><p>October 10th</p><p>The Kyuubi attacked the hidden village of Kohona the shinobi there tried to protect their village even at the cost of their lives. Things like "We must hold him off till Yondaime gets here!" and "Hold him back as long as you can!" could be heard through that day/night. Meanwhile in Kohona hospital Yondaime was watching the birth of his son and soon he would do something he did not want to do, make his own son live alone with noone to care for him like a parent could. After Naruto was born the Fourth took the baby with him and summoned Gamabunta and headed to the battle. Yondaime realized he could not kill the Kyuubi through sheer force but he could seal him away and he used the <u>Fuuin jutsu Shiki Fuujin</u>, Flare who was watching his 'master' the whole time could not do anything but watch as his 'master's' soul was ripped from his body and put into the body of an infant a human infant at that '<i>Kyuubi I will protect you even if you are trapped in that unworthy body</i>' thought Flare as he fell back to avoid being seen by the leaf shinobi but he needn't worry for they were busy mourning the loss of their Yondaime (A/N I just realized something if Flare is alive now who is the one later hmm...) Flare was upset that a new Jinchuriki had been made now be had to protect this baby from dying while his 'master' did the same thing but mainly the Kyuubi would be healing while Flare, well kept the boy alive.</p><p>Naruto's 12th birthday(A/N This Flare is the son of the previously mentioned Flare)</p><p>Flare was watching Naruto carefully making sure he did not get ambushed like every year and not to Flare's surprise Naruto was and this time the Hokage was not able to save him. "<u>Kage Shunshin No Jutsu</u>" said Flare shadow shunshining to the boy's defence "Who would attack a defencless child?" he asked looking the mob in the eye "Shinobi and civilin attacking this kid will not be accepted" said Flare and he made three handseals "<u>Kami-Kitsune</u>" said Flare as he closed his eyes "Why should we listen to you?" asked the mob Flare shook his head "Because he is no biju nor will he become one" said Flare opening his eyes revealing red eyes with nine pointed stars for the pupils "I can see that some of you have Gekke Genkai, good I would love more then just this" said Flare pointing to his eyes, at that the mob started to back away "Too late" said Flare shadow shunshining behind the group and stabbing one of them with a kunai "One down" he said smiling sadisticly causing the Shinobi in the group of people to shudder they knew e shunshined but they could not tell where he was for some reason "I guess you are wondering why you could not tell where I was headed" said Flare and the shinobi started shunshining people away while Flare shook his head then an Uchiha activated his Sharingan "Ahh the sharingan" said Flare staring the Uchiha in the eye "Looks like you get a treat" said Flare smiling evilly and he went through seven handseals "You know truthfully I like this jutsu you know why? because I am the only one who can use it" said Flare biting his thumb causing it to bleed "<u>Kitsune Guardian Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>" said Flare slamming his hand on the ground and summoning the Sanbi "Hello Sanbi long time no see, I would like you to have some fun" said Flare jumping off of the biju "just don't make too much noise" he added smiling till the Hokage appeared "Kai" said Flare sending Sanbi back "Hokage-teme" said Flare with his eyes narrow and yet the third did not seemed put off "Who are you?" was all he asked looking directly at Flare "I am the Kitsune Guardian" said Flare shunshining away leaving a confused village. Naruto was knocked out before Flare had started to talk to the mob and he did not hear any of what Flare had said(A/N duh), but the Hokage decided it was time for Naruto to know the truth. The next morning after Naruto was discharged from the hospital the Hokage sent an ANBU to take him to the Hokage's tower(A/N if I put that wrong sorry) once there the Hokage asked Naruto how much he knew about the Kyuubi "Not much old man" said Naruto "Just that he attacked the village a long time ago and Yondaime defeated him" said Naruto leaning back in the chair he was sitting in, the third shook his head "Defeated in a way Naruto" said the third with that Naruto gave the third a confused look "Naruto, you are what is known as a Jinchuriki" said the third...</p><p>Flare was watching from the tree outside the Hokage's tower using the Kitsune Dou or Fox eyes and smiled at Naruto reaction and Shadow shunshined into the office "Nice work gaki I hope you are ready for the repercotions mainly because the Kyuubi is <i>female</i>" said Flare making the third sweatdrop "F-fe-female?" he stuttered partly scared "Aye and one of three things <i>is</i> going to happen, one Naruto goes with me and trains to a point where I can release the Kyuubi without killing him in otherwords I would not risk a human life even for the one I am suppose to protect, two he loses control against the Kyuubi's chakra and she frees herself killing the boy, or three he becomes her mate." said Flare smiling "And to let you know you lost a bloodline so to speak" he added quickly "Ok whatever back to the Kyuubi what do you mean it's a she?" asked the third, Flare sweatdropped "You don't think she attacked you for no reason? It was her 'time of the month'" said Flare shivering scared of the time seeing as his father was usually the only male in the area meaning he had to deal with it himself "Anyway See you around Teme" said Flare kage shunshining out of there back to his tree to watch the show</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Auther's Note:

I think not, I am <i>human</i> remember? I can't kill a defencless kid" said Flare angrily "especially since he can also use the Kami-Ktisune" said Flare calming down a bit "<b>Your kidding me</b>" said Kyuubi looking to the baka known as Naruto who was shivering in the corner after feeling the powerlevels coming off of Flare "<u>Kitsune Dou</u>" said Flare acsessing the seond level "I don't lie to you especially about stuff like this" said Flare as he looked Kyuubi in the eye "<b>Fox eyes!</b>" said Kyuubi surprised "<b>You mastered the Kami-kitsune?</b>" asked Kyuubi though she could see he had(A/N I am making sure Flare is a true part of the story) "Obviously. now I haveto go before the Kitsune Dou merges me with him" said Flare leaving the Kyuubi and an suddenly unconsous Naruto. Flare woke up still in the tree he had been in and he left Kohona to gather a sannin to teach Naruto the Rasengan or the chidori either one was good...</p><p>Naruto woke up in the Hokage's office "Old man why was there a guy in my head?" asked Naruto causing the third to sweatdrop "What do you mean?" he asked Naruto confused as hell not knowing what had gone on inside Naruto's head, so Naruto started to explain afterwards the third sweatdropped looking out the window to see not only had they been talking all day but his paper work had piled up so much it was outside.</p><p>Back with Flare:</p><p>Flare was sitting with Oroachimaru listening to his 'promises' of power when Flare activated the Kitsune Dou "SHUT UP!!" said Flare pissed off at having to listen to that for the last hour and a half (A/N Time flies when your having fun).

"I will get you Ero-sennin!!" said Flare leaving their new companion alone for the akatsuki to grab or at least that is what Itachi and Kisame thought only for Flare to appear beside her as they stepped out to confront her "Hello Uchiha" said Flare activating the stolen bloodlimit he had taken "His eyes are like yours Itachi is he related to you?" asked Kisame looking from Flare to Itachi and back again. "No, who are you?" asked Itachi looking at Flare "Awe I'm hurt, hunting Jinchuriki and not knowing a guardian when you see one" said Flare in a mocking voice that even annoyed Itachi "A guardian? so you are the Hachibi's guardian?" asked Kisame drawing his sword smiling evilly "No as a matter of fact I am the Kitsune Guardian and you are going to meet one of your targets" said Flare running through the handseals faster then he had ever before "<u>Kitsune Guardian Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>!!!" said Flare summoning the Hachibi <b>"Flare what do you want this time are you just using me to scare that pathatic human again?" </b>asked Hachibi as Flare jumped onto the biju pulling Ellimere with him "No Hachibi-sama, look" said Flare pointing to Itachi and Kisame <b>"Oh a gift!!"</b> said Hachibi clapping causing not only Flare and Ellimere to sweatdrop but Itachi and Kisame as well "Well see you later" said the not easily scared Uchiha scared like, both of them shunshining away Flare let Hachibi return to the seal. "Ellimere are you ok?" asked Flare looking right at her not realizing that Ero-sennin was watching from behind a tree "Y-yes Flare-sa -" started Ellimere but Flare intrrupted her "Don't call me by that I only guard the Kyuubi I don't deserve a honorific name" said Flare pulling Ellimere close and as they pulled eachother close their eyes closed "Oi Teme" said Ero-sennin causing the to love-birds to seperate before they had even kiss "What is it Ero-sennin?" asked Flare annoyed as hell for some reason(A/N I think I know why, anyone else know why?) "We heading to Konaha or not?" asked Ero-sennin smiling at the annoyed tone in Flare's voice "We are but Ero-sennin teach me the rasengan" said Flare earning a look from the sannin and his 'friend' Ellimere "Why?" asked Ero-sennin narrowing his eyes "I want to learn it and well I would like to know every Jutsu I can before I die" said Flare with a shrug. and so Flare started to learn the Rasengan.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Notes:

After Flare got the clay he shoved it into Hachibi's mouth and set it off causing everybody except Flare and the Hachibi to sweatdrop <b>"What... The... Fuck..."</b> said the Kyuubi Flare looked at her "You really think I want to listen to you two reminise?" asked Flare that got him a silent answer which was all he needed Sasori and his partner fled seeing that this guy was way toi weird to fight against. After Flare sent the Kyuubi back to Naruto Flare sat beside Ellimere again and smiled "Hopefully now we'll... Have... No... Intrruptions" said Flare as they started yet again only to be intrrupted but ero-sennin "TEME!!" yelled Flare</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>Flare sat in the waiting room of the Hokage's office waiting for the Hokage to get off his 'high horse' and greet them, '<i>Even though I am out of chakra doesn't mean I still can't take out a whole squad of ANBU</i>' thought Flare tapping his foot.</p><p>At the hotsprings</p><p>(A/N Ahhh Nice and relaxing... HEY WTF?!?! LET ME REST HERE!)</p><p>With Naruto</p><p>Naruto was with Kakashi and the rest of team seven when Ero-sennin appeared "Kakashi I have decided to teach Naruto" said the pervert, Kakashi literaly fell down off the bridge and half drowned before Sakura saved him seeing as Naruto and Sasuke were to stunned to do anything</p><p>Back with Flare</p><p>Flare and Ellimere walked into the Hokage's main office "Hello Teme" said Flare earning a reprochful look from Ellimere whom the Hokage ignored at least for now "What do you want Flare" said the third not lookinbg up from his paper work "Same as last time though now I have two Jinchuriki to teach though it will be kinda hard seeing as I think I-" started Flare but leaving the rest unsaid luckily the Hokage knew what he was trying to say or was it unluckily? "Hello Hokage-sama" said Ellimere with a slight bow catching the attention of the third and he smiled seeing what Flare meant easily and he nodded back "I guess you want to get Naruto" said the third smiling slightly "Yeah if you will let me train him I can teach him alot and better yet let me teach him and let Ellimere join your village and I'll join the Konoha Shinobi and let a select few sign the Kitsune Guardian summoning scroll" said Flare offering alot for what seemed like a little "I would but it would seem I would be messing up the gennin teams and I-" said the third before getting intrrupted by Kakashi "Sir Jiriaya said he wants to train Naruto" said Kakashi then he saw Flare and at that moment Flare opened his eyes revealing the Sharingan and Kakashi attacked Flare, Flare dodged the attack and revealed the Kitsune dou "Don't mess with me Copy-cat" said Flare getting into the taijujitu style he had customized called the death style "BOTH OF YOU SIT!" said Ellimere so sternly that the Hokage sat down even though he was already sitting and Flare sat down immedintly and Flare gave Kakashi a look that warned him not to mess with the girl "She is almost as strong as Naruto" said Flare simply refering to nine-tails Nauto, Kakashi sat down and the third jumped out the window scared for his life "..." said Flare he had gotten enough Chakra back to get the third which he did "Sit" said Flare holding a kunai to the third's throat "Ok fine" said the third and Flare explained the whole ordeal before leaving with Ellimere leaving the third and Kakashi to decide their near future and Flare grabbed Ellimere's hand and kage shunshined to the hokage's mountain</p><p><i>We were strangers, starting out on a journey</i></p><p><i>Never dreaming, what we'd have to go through</i></p><p><i>Now here we are, I'm suddenly standing</i></p><p><i>At the beginning with you</i></p><p>Flare pushed Ellimere away from the edge and smiled pushing his body against her's Ellimere smiling but blushing because of their closeness</p><p><i>No one told me I was going to find you</i></p><p><i>Unexpected, what you did to my heart</i></p><p><i>When I lost hope, you were there to remind me</i></p><p><i>This is the start</i></p><p>Ellimere pulled Flare a little closer blushing and smiling the whole time</p><p><i>And life is a road that I wanna keep going</i></p><p><i>Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing</i></p><p><i>Life is a road, now and forever, wonderful journey</i></p><p><i>I'll be there when the world stops turning</i></p><p><i>I'll be there when the storm is through</i></p><p><i>In the end I wanna be standing</i></p><p><i>At the beginning with you</i></p><p><i>We were strangers on a crazy adventure</i></p><p><i>Never dreaming, how our dreams would come true</i></p><p><i>Now here we stand, unafraid of the future</i></p><p><i>At the beginning with you</i></p><p>Flare and Ellimere were bring their lips closer to eachother their eyes shut</p><p><i>And life is a road that I wanna keep going</i></p><p><i>Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing</i></p><p><i>Life is a road, now and forever, wonderful journey</i></p><p><i>I'll be there when the world stops turning</i></p><p><i>I'll be there when the storm is through</i></p><p><i>In the end I wanna be standing</i></p><p><i>At the beginning with you</i></p><p><i>Knew there was somebody, somewhere</i></p><p><i>A new love in the dark</i></p><p><i>Now I know my dream will live on</i></p><p><i>I've been waiting so long</i></p><p><i>Nothing's gonna tear us apart</i></p><p>Soon their lips touched as they shared their first kiss someone watched them oblivious to the love-birds</p><p><i>And life is a road that I wanna keep going</i></p><p><i>Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing</i></p><p><i>Life is a road, now and forever, wonderful journey</i></p><p><i>I'll be there when the world stops turning</i></p><p><i>I'll be there when the storm is through</i></p><p><i>In the end I wanna be standing</i></p><p><i>At the beginning with you</i></p><p>As Flare pulled away smiling softly he held her close</p><p><i>Yeah</i></p><p><i>Life is a road that I wanna keep going on</i></p><p><i>Love is a river, I wanna keep going</i></p><p><i>Starting out on a journey</i></p><p>Ellimere smiled at him</p><p><i>Life is a road that I wanna keep going</i></p><p><i>Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing</i></p><p><i>In the end I wanna be standing</i></p><p><i>At the beginning with you</i></p><p>Flare said three words that touched Ellimere's heart "I love you" said Flare</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Notes:</p><p>Well that turned out funny at least to me R&R</p><p>Song: At The Beginning</p><p>I know not the best song but I love it reminds me of my 'hime' my princess anyway see you next time</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>

<p><u>Love is an Odd Thing</u></p><p>Inside Naruto's head</p><p>Kyuubi was waiting fror Flare to knockout Naruto again <i><b>Why do I feel like this?</b></i> she thought reminising on the fact Naruto seemed to spend more time with her then before returning to the outside world</p><p>Flashback:</p><p>Naruto just fell asleep and went to the Kyuubi's cage "You want out?" asked Naruto <b>"Oh isn't that obvious?"</b> asked Kyuubi agitated from the need to release and a male being within twenty feet of her, leaving her frusterated because she could do nothing about it. "How about we walk my mind? together?" asked Naruto nervously Kyuubi looked up <b>"Really!?!?"</b> asked Kyuubi smiling her foxy grin that seemed to evil for her "Yeah just one thing Kyuubi-chan, can you be human?" asked Naruto stupidly and Kyuubi sweatdropped <b>"Of course we biju can gaki."</b> said Kyuubi transforming into a close to human form keeping her fox ears and her tails <b>"See?"</b> asked Kyuubi</p><p>End Flashback</p><p><i><b>It seems he likes me but why?</b></i> thought Kyuubi stupidly just then Naruto walked up to her cage "Ready to go?" he asked simply Kyuubi nodded and smiled at the scenery that the young blonde cooked up sortof <b>"Naruto-kun..."</b> said Kyuubi trying to get Naruto's attention Naruto turned to her "Yeah Kyuubi-chan?" asked Naruto turning to her only for the Kyuubi to push her lips against his. "Kyu-chan!" said Naruto pulling away a bit the Kyuubi looked at him <b>"Yes?"</b> asked Kyuubi smiling so slightly you had to look very close to see it, "Why did you kiss me?" asked Naruto(A/N Dense isn't he?) and Kyuubi shook her head <b>"Why do you think Naruto-kun?"</b> asked Kyuubi. Naruto blushed and kissed her back "Just don't surprise me again" said Naruto pulling away again</p><p>With the rest of the group</p><p>"Naruto get your ass up" said Ero-sennin seeing Naruto's lips in the form of a kiss, Flare just shook his head, "You're not going to have to much chance of waking him it seems he is making-out with Kyuubi-sama" Ero-sennin looked to Flare and then looked worried "I guess I should stop it" said Ero-sennin when Flare kage shunshined and grabbed the hand that was drawn back to put another seal on Naruto's seal. "I won't do that if I were you, because what <i>I</i> did when you intruppted me and Ellimere-chan won't compare to what Kyuubi-sama will do to you after Naruto's training" said Flare simply ero-sennin facefaulted not only was this baka training the boy he was going to kill him afterward "You're going to waste all the training you put into him by releasing the Kyuubi?" asked Ero-sennin not knowing the full meaning of the training "Normally you would be right but seeing as Naruto is forging a relatonship with the kyuubi his body will open the passageways out of him after the seal is remove and she won't have to force her way out, the training is because even if she does not have to force her way out it will still cause far to much pain for a normal shinobi endurence even more then for you. But if somehow I can get him to acsess the Kitsune dou I can release Kyuubi-sama sooner and Naruto will still live, but if not I will continue to train him till his endurence reaches the peak of human endurence and then I will release the seal" said Flare looking ero-sennin in the eye to show he was telling the truth.</p><p>Back with Naruto</p><p>Naruto was being pushed against a 'tree' while Kyuubi continued to kiss him, soon though Naruto turned them around and he was the agresser pulling away from her lips letting his body tell him what to do he started to kiss down her neck getting to the point of where her neck joins the rest of her body Naruto gave it a small nip drawing a moan from his demonic girlfriend...</p><p>Back outside children before we all die!!</p><p>Flare was sitting with Ellimere, her back leaning against his chest when he heard the moan "Why me?" he asked quietly seeing as only him and Hachibi heard it and noting that Ellimere had not made one sound, that meant it was Kyuubi. Flare kissed Ellimere on her neck softly "Flare-kun do you love me?" asked Ellimere suddenly surprising Flare none the less he answered quickly "Why ask that Elli-chan? You know I love you" said Flare looking ahead. Ellimere turned around he pushed her lips onto Flare's firmly and turning them away from the tree they had been leaning against both of them were on the ground staring at eachother.</p><p>THIS IS THE LAST PLACE I KNOW OF!!</p><p>with Ero-sennin</p><p>(A/N No turn around this is to messed up for even Orrochimaru to write about)</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Auther's Notes:

"Why did you forget you are the eldest of the group when the akatsuki attacked?" asked Ero-sennin not hiding his anger "Well lets see I love Elli-chan and we got lost in the moment" said Flare</p><p>Flashback:</p><p>Flare blocked a kick toward Ellimere he had only just gotten up and ready to fight he was the only one.</p><p>end flashback</p><p>"All three of you, no <i>four</i> of you could've been kill" said ero-sennin Flare's annoyince got the best of him "<i>Could've</i> but we didn't, of course I couldn't summon a Biju but I have many other jutsu and the death style taijujitu in my arsenal not to mention the raiton: Rasengen" said Flare looking the toad sannin in the eye.</p><p>Flashback:</p><p>Flare had just finished making the Raiton: Rasengan and the land was scarred by his practice "<u>Kitsune Guardian Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>!" said Flare after completing the handseals and he summoned the Nibi "Hello Nibi-sama" said Flare as he bowed to her "I need some help I was making a powerful new jutsu and as you can see I kind of ruined the landscape" said Flare. <b>"Sure anything for one of the higher level guardians"</b> said Nibi causing Flare to cringe.</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"So? that jutsu is a <i>kinjujitu</i>" said ero-sennin trying to deswade Flare but Flare shook his head "Most of the Jutsu I know are kinjujitu namly..." said Flare putting his hands in the bird handseal "<u>Zodiak Control</u>!!" said Flare forcing chakra into the handseal and a few birds flew to him "See?" asked Flare, the sannin shook his head "You don't get it do you Flare?" asked Ero-sennin exasperated. "What do you mean Ero-sennin?" asked Flare releasing the jutsu ero-sennin let the remark slide Flare was his equal whether he liked it or not "kinjujitu are not supposed to be used unless the need arises" said Ero-sennin.

<p>Kitsune Guardian:</p><p><u>Chuunin Exam Blunder!</u></p><p>Naruto, Flare, and Ellimere were going to participate in the chuunin Exam when they saw Konohamaru being messed with by the sand-sibs Flare and Naruto kage shunshined behind the sand-sibs "I'd put him down if I were you especially if you don't want to meet the demon sealed in your brother or maybe worse the one in my girlfriend" said Flare behind Temari. Gaara had just suna-shined in "Come on lets go" said Gaara but Flare had other plans "I don't think so" said Flare and Naruto stood beside him with a scroll to summon his katana Flare went through the handseals "<u>Kitsune Guardian Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>" said Flare summoning the Ichbi "Meet your 'inner'demon" said Flare with a small laugh as Gaara cringed from the demon leaving the seal "I hope you enjoy meeting him" said Flare grabbing Naruto and Ellimere and kage shunshined away but enough so Flare could send the demon back after a bit of time, Sandaime shunshined to Flare and gave him a look "Hokage-sama it is just a Jinchuriki meeting his 'tendent' " said Flare and he smiled "Naruto is going to need his own room so Elli-chan and I don't have to hear him with Kyuubi-sama" added Flare. Sandaime sweatdropped "What do you mean by that?" he asked and Flare blushed and didn't answer</p><p>Flashback:</p><p>"Hey Flare!" said Naruto three weeks away from Konoha the group decided to rest it had been four years(A/N Flare is now 18 Ellimere and Naruto are now 16) "What is it Naruto-kun(A/N you spend four years with someone and not grow close to them)?" asked Flare looking to Naruto, Ellimere on his shoulder Flare waited for the number-one surprise ninja to say something "Can you summon Kyuu-chan?" asked Naruto and Flare fell to the side "WHAT?!?! TWO DAYS AND YOU CAN BE WITH HER ALL YOU WANT AND YOU WANT ME TO WASTE CHAKRA SUMMONING HER?!?!" yelled Flare and Naruto looked away "No not in two days, two years" said Naruto, "I am entering the Chuunin Exam Kyuu-chan wants me to be able to lead a team before she is released" said Naruto. Flare looked at him not two days ago he would have hit Naruto upside the head for that kind of idea but it was Kyuubi's idea... "Fine" said Flare going through the handseals "<u>Kitsune Guardian Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>!" said Flare summoning the Kyuubi who was in her human like form and immedently started to kiss Naruto, Flare sweatdropped "Oi Kyuubi-sama could you please wait till me and Elli-chan move out of earshot of <i>his</i> moans?" asked Flare knowing there was nowhere on earth, heaven, or hell he could escape her moans. <b>"Oh get over it"</b> said Kyuubi</p><p>End Flashback</p><p>"I never want to deal with those two again" said Flare curled up in the fetal position Ellimere trying to comfort him "Flare-kun please calm down" said Ellimere and Flarenodded and started to relax his muscles and Ellimere hugged him "Don't worry about <i>them</i>" said Ellimere kissing his cheek. "Elli-chan, I love you" said Flare turning and wrapping his arms around her and pressing his lips to hers again before punching Sandaime "I <i>hate</i> perverts with a passion" said Flare and Naruto fell backwards laughing as Flare sent the Ichbi back into it's seal and he went to see Gaara "Well how did he behave?" asked Flare Temari tried to hit him with a fuuton jutsu "<u>Fuuton Kai No Jutsu</u>!!" said Flare canceling out the jutsu "I don't take lightly to behind the back attacks Temari-san" said Flare turning to her drawing a pair of claw-gloves "Who are you?" asked Gaara that manical look in his eyes "Never mind who he is <i>What</i> is he?" asked Konkuru(A/N I know I did not spell that right...). Flare turned to the rest of the sand-sibs "I am a Biju guardian the Kyuubi's to be precise" said Flare and Naruto shunshined beside him "Flare-san are you talking about Kyu-chan again?" asked Naruto causing the sand-sibs to look at Naruto like he had two heads even Gaara looked scared '<i>What type of human does a demon take to be it's mate?</i>' thought Gaara taking a step back Flare waved "Well see you in the Exams" said Flare placing his hand on Ellimere's shoulder and kage shunshined away to his apartment "Ellimere since we're going to be chuunin soon I want to ask you a question" said Flare getting down on one knee...(A/N The Evil of Cliff-hangers HAHAHAHA!!!)</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Notes:</p><p>Well those who can not guess his question go to elementry school again those who could what do you think her answer will be?</p><p>R&R</p><p>Poll</p><p>Yes</p><p>No</p><p>kills Flare</p><p>"HELL YES" said Ellimere before forcing Flare onto his back and slipping her hand(...)</p><p>Well vote and I'll tell you who got it right</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>

Will you marry me?" asked Flare nervously, Flare was waiting for Ellimere's answer "HELL YES" said Ellimere before forcing Flare onto his back and slipping her hand down Flare's chest and slowly onto his pants while kissing him "W-hat are you doing?" asked Flare with a slight stutter as Ellimere started kissing Flare down his neck "I'm enjoying my Fiance' " she said, '<i>In more ways then one</i>' she added silently. "Elli-hime, I love you and all bu-" started Flare. "Shhh, Flare-kun" said Ellimere(A/N I made a sex crazed girl sortof...) as she pulled Flare's shirt off him. It seemed their hands had a mind of their own as they undressed eachother.</p><p>Ok keeping true to my morals we are going to let them be(first time), lets go see Naruto</p><p>Naruto was sitting in the Hokage's tower alone since Flare and Ellimere left to do Kami knows what "Naruto You contian the Kyuubi and According to Flare you have been forging a relationship with it, why?" asked Sandaime. "Why? you want to know why?" asked Naruto, "I love her" said Naruto vemon lacing his voice at the question "Why?" asked Sandaime, Naruto threw him a look a pure vemon(A/N OOC I know but wouldn't you be pissed if someone queestioned your love for someone else?) "I love her because unlike this village she didn't judge me till she got to know me" said Naruto. "Naruto I know you <i>say</i> you love her but-" started Sandaime untill Naruto intruppted "That is it" he said going through handseals "<u>Kitsune Guardian Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>!!" said Naruto summoning Kyuubi "Kyu-chan" said Naruto smiling at her and hugged her tightly <b>"Naru-kun why did you summon me so soon after last time?"</b> asked Kyuubi not noticing Sandaime she licked her lips(A/N Now if only my hime would be like that... joking, joking, I love the way my girlfriend is) <b>"You i-" </b>started Kyuubi. "No Kyu-chan I just thought you'd like to meet the Sandaime hokage" said Naruto. "Flare let you sign the Kitsune Guardian summoning Scroll?" asked Sandaime raising an eyebrow "Well after me asking him to summon Kyu-chan he got kind of tired of summoning her just so her and I could go have 'fun' " said Naruto, and Sandaime flew backwards from a nosebleed "Kyu-chan do you think I could kill him without the whole village finding out?" asked Naruto(A/N ...) Kyuubi thought about it for a second before saying <b>"No, Naruto, I don't think anyone could"</b> said Kyuubi, <b>" </b>'<b>Sept maybe a demon but I can't kill him because you summoned me and they'd think you told me to kill him"</b>. "It is nice to see that you care about me" said Naruto smiling again and he kissing her passionatly before she returned to the seal, "What happened?" asked Sandaime getting up from his small puddle of blood "I am done talking to you ero-kage" said Naruto leaving the hokages office couple ANBU tried to follow him and he turned to them "Get out here, I know you're there, and I thought ANBU were supposed to be the best of the best next to the Sannin" said Naruto and twenty or so ROOT ANBU came out from their hiding "Well if it isn't the demon how-"started one of the more stupid ones and Naruto was behind him "I am not <i>the</i> demon or a demon in anyshape or form but if you really want to meet Kyu-chan I guess I could ablige" said Naruto and the ROOT ANBU attacked him and the fight started</p><p>With Flare</p><p>Flare heard Kyuubi talking to Naruto while he laid next to a sleeping Ellimere and gave her a kiss on the cheek "I'll be right back" he whispered into her ear and he got dressed and shunshined(A/N Note I said shunshined not Kage Shunshined) to Naruto and he smiled "I'd leave the Jinchuriki alone if I were you" said Flare leaning agained the tree activating the Kami-Kitsune "Ooo it looks like I get a treat the Ingan[1(A/N from A Tail of Two Bijus[Read it please I am going to continue the second story I had already asked but I have a little problem with ideas so I'll be awhile) and Byakugan in one place" said Flare licking his lips and activating the Sharingan he had taken all those years ago, "Let's dance Hyuuga and Kynia(OC name for the clan that has the Ingan I can not use the original user[Naruto because well he has the Kami-kitsune in this story)" said Flare getting into his taijujitu style called Shiton[2(A/N I hope the writer was right...[A tail of Two Biju) and the Hyuuga and Kynai got into their respective styles all Flare could do was smile "This is going to be fun" he said and he charged in...</p><p>Naruto</p><p>Naruto was dodging the others and he threw a kunai and a few shuriken hitting a couple of the ROOT, Naruto was discusted "You call yourselves ANBU?" asked Naruto as he made the rasengan "I hope you see my father tell him from me Thanks this curse has become a blessing, RASENGAN!" said Naruto pushing it into the nearest ROOT ANBU...</p><p>Flare</p><p>Flare could have killed them forty times already but he really wanted their Gekke genkai and the Hyuuga got tired of the dance and activated her Byakugan and Flare deactivated his Sharingan and then reactivated his Kami-kitsune "Sweet 360 degress(sp?)" said Flare smiling as the Kynai actvated his Gekke genkai and Flare took it as soon as he did "Two more for me" said Flare smiling as he knocked them out.</p><p>Naruto</p><p>Naruto was getting tired of this dance and threw his arm to his side(A/N sound gross but it is still attached) and gathered chakra into it(A/N his hand is in a fist right now) he stuck out one finger and the chakra gathered there and turned into Fuuton, he put out a second finger and chakra gathered there too it turned into Katon, third Raiton(A/N only time he can use it is with jutsu), fourth Daiton, and then he stuck out his thumb and the chakra that gathered there turned into Suiton "<u>Go Ton Rendan Whip</u>[3!!" said Naruto throwing his hand around and a whip of the five elements whiped around knocking out the rest of the ROOT "Thanks Flare-kun for the help" said Naruto as he canceled out the go ton rendan whip and walked over to Flare "No problem but I have to go just go to the Hokage and tell him you were attacked ok?" asked Flare, not waiting for an answer he kage shunshined back to his apartment and shower and he threw the clothes on the floor and he washed up.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Notes:

<p>Kitsune Guardian:</p><p><u>Exam Troubles Part One: Annoyences</u></p><p>with the whole group</p><p>"Team Biju?" asked Flare as they walked to the Exam building. "Well you are a Biju guardian and Naruto and I both contian the two strongest bijus in the world" said Ellimere smiling again for the fouth time that day "Ellimere why do you keep on smiling?" asked Naruto, and Flare walked over to a building and banged his head on it over and over as Ellimere explained why "Because the same reason you do after a night with Kyuubi" said Ellimere. Flare's head was bleeding and he heal it with a medical jutsu as they walked into the building after they went up to the second Floor they saw what appeared to be the room but the three continued up one more floor and low behold they got to the real room, Lee walked up to them "Fight me" was all he said and Flare started to say something when Ellimere intruppted "We are beyond your level Lee-san" she was not rude about it or shot down Lee's dreams and Flare just smiled "After the Exam elivated or not Lee-san I'll spare with you no chakra on my part for my taijujitu style requires chakra to deadly but it is the deadliest taijujitu style there is" said Flare with a nod Kabuto walked over(A/N Can I kill him? please pease[ Flare[Me No) "Kabuto-san" said Flare with a nod and Kabuto reconized him Imedently and nodded back "I came to see if the Rookies needed any info on the test" said Kabuto and Flare nodded "I would like to know about that Gennin team" said Flare pointing to Lee's team and Ellimere pointed to the Sand-sibs "You have any info on them?" she asked and Naruto looked around "Do you have any info on the second part of the exam?" he asked. Flare sweatdropped "Naruto I don't think he will answer that question" said Flare, "Well?", and Kabuto snapped out of his daze and pulled out his deck of infocards "Rock Lee: a pure Taijujitu user unable to use chakra; Hyuuga Neji: Was the rookie of the year when he grauated and specializes in the Juken style of fighting; Tenten: a weapons specialist" said Kabuto and Flare nodded, "Temari of the sand: A wind user(A/N I do not know alot about the Sand-sibs...); Konkuro of the Sand: a puppet user" Flare smiled at this he was going to have fun with those two, "and Gaara of the Sand: has returned from high ranking missions without so much as a scratch on him" finished Kabuto. Naruto pointed to the sound team "Any info on them?" asked Naruto Kabuto smiled and nodded "Yes I do Naruto-kun" said Kabuto and Flare slapped himself on the head "Sound gennin from the village hidden in the sound it is a relitivly new village-" started Kabuto when the sound gennin attacked Kabuto and Flare just smiled and went through handseals quickly "<u>Oto Kai No Jutsu</u>[1!" said Flare stopping the sound waves from hitting him and Duzo smiled underneath his mask "So you think you dodged?" he asked and Flare shrugged "No, I know I dodged it, <i>all</i> of it" said Flare, and Kabuto looked at him confused(A/N Yeah right) and then his glasses broke "Oh I see it was that kind of attack" said Kabuto, and then he fell onto his knees and coughed up some blood Flare shook his head and knelt beside Kabuto and started to heal him. Ibaki chose that moment to shunshin in as Flare was healing Kabuto "Oi you red-head over the (A/N White? or is it Silver?) haired kid what are you doing?" asked Ibaki and Flare looked at him, "What does it look like I am doing? I'm healing him dumb-ass examer" said Flare so blanten that Ibaki lost it no one had ever outright insulted him anf Flare never even looked up as he blocked Ibaki "Jeez Anku would be more of a match but at least you are better then the Hyuuga and Kynai I fought" said Flare at the mention of their clans the members in the exam stood up and Flare stood up,"One, I am beyond Sannin rank, two, I have only three people to worry about here in terms of strength and that is in order from weakest to strongest, Gaara, Elli-hime, and Naruto". Gaara looked at the two behind Flare and got that look in his eyes again "Prey" said Gaara as Flare stood up, "No Gaara those two could beat you and heal you just to beat you again without breaking a sweat" said Flare, "I on the otherhand will break a sweat win or lose". Kabuto stood up Ibaki still could not understand how he could be Sannin level and not be promoted even without the exam "Ibaki snap out of it" said Flare as he grabbed a number and got to his seat as the rest of Team Biju did the same Ibaki handed out he test and said the rules and they got to the tenth question and Flare spoke for his team "I'm taking it". and after several teams quit Ibaki stood up "You all pass" said Ibaki and went on with explaining the whole reason for the tenth question Flare zoned-out thinking of what him and Elli-hime were going to do after the chuunin exams.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Notes:</p><p>1.

<p>Kitsune Guardian:</p><p><u>Exam Troubles Part Two: The Real Test Begins!</u></p><p>Flare started to get up to leave when Anko appeared "Great the Snake's <i>former</i> apprentice" said Flare flopping down into his seat, "Plan on being more of a challenge then Ibaki?" and Anko shunshined behind him "You bet I am" said Anko. "I hope for this Exam's sake" said Flare kage shunshining to Ellimere and then shunshuning to his Apartment. "Fuckin A!" said Naruto as he got left behind yet again, "Seeya later Team Biju is outta here" and he kage shunshined to his apartment. and started going through the familiar handseals and then he bit his thumb and summoned Kyuubi, "Kyu-chan!". Kyuubi just stood there smelling the air <b>"I knew your place was ok"</b> said Kyuubi as she leaned over to him and kissed him passionately pulling him close, <b>"I'm guessing you need to sleep tonight..."</b> said Kyuubi with a puppy-dog-eyes and Naruto nodded. "Yeah I do but I want to hold you as well" said Naruto...</p><p>With Ellimere and Flare</p><p>"Night Elli-hime" said Flare laying beside his fiancé as she smiled, "Night Flare-kun" and with that they went to sleep.</p><p>The next morning</p><p>Naruto, Ellimere, and Flare were waiting at the forest of death Anko looked surprised "You don't think we are stupid do you?" asked Flare as he lean back. "I am surprised you never stayed for th destination and yet you are the first group here" said Anko licking her dry lips, "Orochimaru gave you a cursed seal didn't he?" asked Flare suddenly before anyone got there. Anko nodded drawing a kunai ready to attack him, Flare activated the Ingan he had taken "I'd like to see it" said Flare surprising the Kunoichi, "I might be able to remove it but not soon seeing as the test will begin soon" said Flare and as if to prove his point the gennin teams started to appear in the area...</p><p>moments later</p><p>Team Biju was going through the trees and looking for a earth scroll when they met up with a grass gennin team and attacked them (A/N You can guess who one of them are) soon Flare go tired of the fight and threw some shuriken and started going through handseals "<u>Kage Fuuton Kai No Jutsu</u>[1!!" said Flare sending chakra enhanced wind tentacles at the only grass nin still standing and then he attacked in the Shiton taijujitu, as Naruto started to attack him too "Fu fu fu. It seems you are strong Flare-kun" started orochimaru taking off his mask and Flare stepped out of the way of a pissed off female who threw the snake sannin against a tree and started to pulverize him Flare just watched. Till Orochimaru put a seal over Ellimere's current seal causing her to feel weaker and Flare just shook his head as Naruto attacked him mainly cause the Kyuubi had control, and Flare was focusing chakra into the long set of handseals he was doing, "I hope you want to die! <u>Kage Chakra No Jutsu</u>[2!!!" yelled Flare removing all the chakra from orochimaru and transferring it to him. Flare collapsed and crawled over to her and checked her seal and nearly laughed '<i>just a seal just a simple seal...</i>' thought Flare before he felt a bite on his neck from Orochimaru "I saw power in you and now I'll have it" said the snake sannin Flare activated his kitsune dou to suppress the cursed seal till they got to the tower and he could ask the Hokage to do something to temporarily seal it, Orochimaru fleeing away. Naruto guards his teammates while they got shuteye which whether or not they liked it they needed Flare was plagued with reams of strength and power, evil power, but power none the less.</p><p>While Ellimere and Flare slept</p><p>Naruto opened his eyes revealing the Kami-kitsune watching his surroundings and he saw the sound nin before they even got close and he called out to them knowing they were already heading to attack them from the KI[3 coming off of them "Don't bother with us I'm the strongest on this team and let me put it this way" started Naruto flying through handseals "A demon is a demon no matter how beautiful she is <u>Kitsune Guardian Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>!" summoning Kyuubi easily <b>"Naru-kun! what do you need this time I couldn't-"</b> started the sex-starved demon when Naruto cut her off, "Oto Shinobi" was all he said pointing behind her and she got the point <b>"Full Demonic glory or just torture till Flare wakes?"</b> asked Kyuubi swinging her tails back and forth smiling sadistically(A/N Remind me not to get on her bad side...). "Torture is preferred I don't want you attacked by Konoha again Kyu-chan" said Naruto earning him boyfriend points though he meant it though.</p><p>In Flare's mind</p><p>Flare found a door that should not be there he opened it...</p><p>Back outside</p><p>Flare opened his eyes as black marks started to cover his body getting up he smiled evilly "Hello Oto nin" said Flare getting into his stance and started to attack(A/N just like in the series with Sasuke)</p><p>Flare was in the lead straight for the tower escorting Kabuto with them when they hit the Genjujitu guarding the tower "Naruto grab Kabuto's arm and guide him with your Kami-kitsune" said Flare grabbing Ellimere roughly though he did not have the luxury to be gentle right now he had to get to the tower before he lost control again, "Sorry Elli-hime" he whispered to her as he activated his Kitsune duo. When they got to the tower Flare grabbed the scrolls and opened them revealing to be summoning scrolls "Well hello" said Flare as the scrolls started to smoke and he threw them down and they summoned the said person(Iruka) "Wow I'm surprised Naruto you got here fast" said Iruka and Naruto gave his trademark fox grin and Flare spoke out "Tell Hokage-sama I need medical attention specifically Sealing" said Flare groaning with the effort to hold back the cursed seal. "Alright I will Flare-san" said Iruka before shunshining to the Hokage who got there soon after, "What is it Flare?" asked Sandaime and Flare released his hold against the cursed seal and it covered his body and then he collapsed and Ellimere ran over to his side "Flare-kun can you hear me?" she cried tears running down her face...</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Notes:</p><p>1.

"Hokage-sama(cough) is that fair to give him(cough) time to rest?" asked the proctor and Flare stood up "I can fight but it would be better for my opponet I go against if him or her and I rested before hand" said Flare as the cursed seal tried to take over his body yet again, "Besides I want a fair chance to be in the finals and with me focusing on keeping the seal at bay it will be an unfair fight for both my opponet and me". the jounin, the proctor, and the Hokage started to debate when Kabuto said "I quit" "Kabuto(A/N Last name would be nice my friend) ok you are out of the Exam" said the proctor and with that they nodded, "Flare and Gaara your fight wil be last" and with that Flare cursed "I have to fight Ichbi's container this is fucking rediculous!", "Either go against Gaara or fight as is" said the Hokage and Flare Nodded and went off to get the cursed seal (A/N Ironicly) sealed.</p><p><u><b>First match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Rock Lee of Konoha vs. </b></u><u><b>Kynai Rune of Konoha</b></u></p><p>Lee jumped into the Arena and got in a Taijujitu stance that easily slides from denfensive to offensive and back with little trouble, Rune shunshined down and got in the Kynai wave taijujitu style(A/N It seems all clans have their taijujitu style...) "(Cough) Begin" said the prcotor and so the match started...</p><p>With Flare</p><p>Flare sat in a dark room with kanji(A/N I am not sure what are those thing on the floor called during the sealing?) circled around him and a unnamed jounin preforming the handseals soon the the cursed seal was well sealed and Flare collapsed and acivated the Kitsune Dou so not the lose time when...</p><p>The Match</p><p>Lee had just blocked another kick from Rune as he started to punch at her "You're very good" said Lee panting (A/N Wave style Taijujitu is based off of a diffrent style of hand to hand combat one where you use your opponet's strength against them) which was unlike him Rune smiled sadisticly "I know" she said...</p><p>Back into that scary room</p><p>"Orochimaru!" said the Jounin as he stood ready to protect the 'uncontious' boy, "Yeah yeah it is me, Orochimaru, you want a autograph?" asked the snake sannin and the jounin nodded his head holding out a autograph book and a pen causing Orochimaru and Flare to sweatdrop...</p><p>Back to the taijuitu user and the sadist(A/N note to self: stop making OCs sadistic and cruel)</p><p>"One second Rune-san" said Lee holding up his hand telling her to stop which she complide thinking he was going to forfit(A/N I make alot of them look like idiots don't I?) and he looked to Gai-sensie who nodded and Lee took off his weights dropping them leaving two craters in the ground everyone sept Naruto and Ellimere sweatdropped(A/N You'll see why later)...</p><p>Back with the Fanboy and a scared 'normal' person and a scared sadist</p><p>Flare stood up "Even though I am a konoha Shinobi Orochimaru do mind helping me destroy this vile creature?" asked Flare pointing to the fanboy.

[Flare: You never had it Me: Shut up)</p><p>Lee had just started to open the gates and blah blah blah just like in the series when he fought against Gaara he lost but afterward Rune walked up to Lee. "Yes?" asked Lee wondering what she wanted, and Rune kissed him "Thanks for the match" she answered and shunshined to her team who shook their heads.</p><p>Back with a sadist and a sannin</p><p>"Flare-kun-" started Orochimaru when Flare put up his hand "One, only Elli-hime can call me that, two, before you ask no I'm not going with you" said FLare before kage shunshining to the rest of his team...</p><p><u><b>Second match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Temari of the Sand vs. Tenten of Konoha</b></u></p><p>The battle was over before it started just like in the series</p><p><u><b>third match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Naruto of Konoha vs. Kiba of Konoha</b></u></p><p>Naruto was in the ring before you could say hokage and as he landed he summoned Kyuubi "Kyu-chan would you like to watch?" asked Naruto as the rest of the rookie six(A/N remember Team 07 is dead!) and Gai's team sweatdrop(A/N While Ellimere and Naruto are rookies Flare is not making team Biju not a rookie team). "WHAT THE HELL WHERE'D SHE COME FROM?!?!" yelled Kiba(A/N Kiba is more of an idiot then Naruto acts...) and Naruto just shook his head, "<i>If</i> you beat me or give me a good match I'll tell you" said Naruto and Flare smiled thinking '<i>He's almost as sadistic as me</i>'. "I'll be watching Naru-kun" said Kyuubi and then she started to make-out with Naruto causing Flare to sweatdrop "Kyuubi-sama get up here!" said Flare getting pissed off at the two love-birds very quickly. "Fine Flare" said Kyuubi and she flame-shunshined up there freaking out everyone sept well team biju "Who the hell is she?" asked Neji and Flare waled up to him and back handed him "She happens to be the Kyuubi No Kitsune the nine-tailed fox" said Flare with a sneer as he walked back to Ellimere "I hate Hyuuga" said Flare and Kyuubi and Ellimere laughed their asses off at his statement.</p><p>The Match was going pretty much like in the series so lets move on</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Notes:</p><p>Lee: You Unyouthful per-</p><p>Writer: Shut it I like you and that is why I got someone to kiss you, don't make me regret that</p><p>Lee: ...</p><p>Writer: What?</p><p>Lee: I was just thinking of Rune-chan</p><p>Writer: (sweatdrops) and you call me unyouthful</p><p>Lee: I know...</p><p>Writer: ...</p><p>Lee: what you thinking about?</p><p>Writer: Killing you</p><p>Lee: ((Wait where is Lee...))</p><p>Writer: R&R</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>

"<u>Kitsune Guardian Seal Release</u>[1" said Flare hitting her seal and she screamed Naruto shook his head when the other teams tried to stop him and soon she stopped screaming as the pain died down "W-what d-did you d-do?" asked Ellimere panting from chakra exaustion, "I released the seal Orochimaru put on you" said Flare as he went through more handseals "<u>Chakra Kawarimi No Jutsu</u>[2" said Flare striking her where the eighth gate resised forcing chakra into her "There now good luck Elli-hime" said Flare kissing her cheek, "Win, I don't want to be stuck with Naruto". Ellimere nodded and Kyuubi tried to hit Flare who did not even look at her before dodging "I maybe on his team but I want to be with her ok Kyuubi-sama?" asked Flare</p><p>Ellimere jumped down and got into a taijujitu stance known as the Kage stance(A/N I come up with alot of taijujitu stances don't I?) and readies herself for a long match. "Just give up already" said Marina getting into her taijujitu style and Ellimere smirked "Why should I?" she asked closing her eyes and reopening them to reveil snake eyes(A/N yeah I do my research not ero-sennin version) and Flare smiled at the Kynai's face "What are you!?" exclamed Marina causing Naruto, Kyuubi(A/N she hasn't gone back yet), and Flare to frown. Ellimere smiled "<i><b>Your worst nightmare</b></i>" said Ellimere wiht her demon's chakra going through her causing the room so shudder, "DEMON!!" said Marina and she tried to attack when, "I don't think you want to call us that" said Naruto smiling sadisticly(A/N Oh no what did I plan...), "Oh shut up Demon-boy" said Marina and Naruto shrugged when Kyuubi jumped into the ring Ellimere jumped out of the way so not to be killed and Flare seeing as this was getting out of hand Kage sunshined down "Kyuubi-sama if you will." said Flare pointing to the area they were supposed to be. soon the match started and Flare made Kyuubi return to the seal. "Naruto next time we go through an exam don't summon her unless you are going to use her in the battle" said Flare from where they were standing watching the match.</p><p>with Ellimere</p><p>The Kynai started to go through handseal when Ellimere using her demon's chakra shunshined behind her "Now your going to see why we're called the the Biju guardians" she whispered into the girl's ear as she went through hand seals "<u>Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>[3!" said Ellimere summoning her demon, and Marina quit not wanting to be eaten by the snake.</p><p><u><b>Fifth Match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Kankuro of the Sand vs. Gena Harshu of the Wave</b></u>(A/N I know I know a lot of OCs but not going into the matches that much)</p><p>Winner Kankuro</p><p><u><b>Sixth Match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Ino of Konoha vs. Chimoh of the Snow</b></u></p><p>Winner Ino(A/N I do not know why I did that)</p><p><u><b>Seventh Match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Shikamaru of konoha vs. Kin of the Sound</b></u></p><p>Winner Shikamaru</p><p><u><b>Eightth Match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Choji of Konoha vs. Dozu(A/N ?) of the Sound</b></u></p><p>Winner Dozu(A/N ?)</p><p><u><b>Nineth Match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Hyuuga Neji of Konoha vs. Hyuuga Hinata of Konoha</b></u></p><p>Sadly though I love this match I can not write it the same way unless I want to make this a harem and I don't so...</p><p>Good bye Hinata winner Neji</p><p><u><b>Tenth Match</b></u></p><p><u><b>Flare Of Konoha vs. Gaara of the Sand</b></u></p><p>Flare shunshined down grinning sadisticly when Gaara appeared in the ring "How was Ichbi-sama feeling?" asked Flare and Gaara flinched along with the rest of the room(A/N They now know his team deals with demons). "Sadly for you though," started Flare grinning sadisticly again, "I can summon <i>any</i> biju" and with that Gaara paled thinking '<i>Ichbi, Nibi, Sanbi, Yonbi, Gobi, Rokubi, Sichibi, Hachibi, Kyuubi...</i>', What is your team?" asked Gaara and Flare smiled a simple smile "My teammates are like you, and I? I am the Kitsune Guardian, the one who could release or perimately seal each biju, the one that respects the biju for what they are not what they are called, the one who sees Jinchuriki as they are the Jailers for the biju not the biju themselves." said Flare a sneeer crossing his face as he looked at the rest of the shinobi, "I could beat everyone here save for a few, Naruto, Elli-hime, and probiblty you, Gaara, I am not equal to the biju or the Jinchuriki but I know one thing every thing has a weakness and I can use it or I can hide it" said Flare. The jounin in the room had flinched when he only had mentioned three gennin the demon boy being one of them and Flare turned to them, "One last thing I have something that even you Hokage would be intrested in knowing, the ROOT ANBU attacked Naruto earlier this week(A/N Bear with me I am growing tired of this too but the fight is worth it)" said Flare as he turned back to Gaara "I'm ready to fight" said Flare getting into the Shiton stance as Gaara's sand started to surround Gaara</p><p>with the rest of team Biju</p><p>"You think Flare-kun has a chance?" asked Ellimere as she watched the sand block some of the strikes, "Yeah he will no problem." said Naruto. It seemed the other teams save for Gaara's tried to get away from them scared of them.</p><p>The Fight</p><p>Flare was growing tired of attacking the sand and jumped back and started to go through handseals "<u>Daiton Kai No Jutsu</u>[4!" Said Flare and Gaara's sand fell to the ground. This had become a taijujitu fight "I hope you like hand to hand combat" said Flare an evil grin on his face as he rushed in only to hit another sand wall Flare seemed to smile, "Tell Ichbi you own him your life because if you look where my hand was aiming for you'd see that you would have died" as he jumped away.</p><p>The stands</p><p>"Gai-sensie, what taijujitu form is that?" asked Lee(A/N [Bangs head on desk) quesioning the taijujitu expert, "It is called the Shiton Taijujitu the creator is-was the Nibi, it sadly is even more deadly then the Hyuuga style" said Gai as Flare blocked the sand with his hand, "What do you mean Gai-sensie?" asked Neji watching as the battle progressed. "The Shiton style relies on the user's chakra control, speed, and flexiblity, I would not be surprised if that kid knew medic-" Gai sensie stopped as Flare was stapped with the sand through the lung.</p><p>Team Biju</p><p>"FLARE-KUN!!" yelled Ellimere as Flare was stabbed and Naruto watched and had a smile on his face he knew what was next</p><p><u>Flashback:</u></p><p>Flare was training Naruto away from Ellimere so incase he was stabbed she would not try to kill Naruto... Flare dodged jab after jab and blocked a kick "Naruto you can do better then that" said Flare and the fight got tougher soon Naruto stabbed Flare ironicly it was in the exact same place he just got stabbed, "FLARE damn it Flare why the fuck did you tell me to go all out on you" said Naruto as he put pressure on the wound Flare opened his eyes reveiling the Kitsune dou "<i><b>I'll be ok</b></i>" said Flare as he started to heal[5.</p><p><u>End Flashback</u></p><p>The Fight</p><p>Flare coughed up blood and just as the Proctor was about to call the match when "<i><b>Don't you dare</b></i>" said Flare opening is eyes revieling the kitsune dou, "<i><b>I am not finished with this baka</b></i>" as his wound slowly healed, "<i><b>I am running out pure demonic chakra now</b></i>" said Flare as he took his stance yet again. Gaara was scared now he had just stabbed this person and now he was just shook it off like it was nothing. soon Flare hit gaara drawing blood Temari, Kankuro, and not to mention Gaara were scared '<i>If this guy can draw Gaara's blood then that means...</i>' thought Temari. '<i>Gaara is going to lose it again</i>' thought Kankuro, "MY BLOOD MY BLOOD!" screamed Gaara. "<i><b>I am faster then I look, it seems Gaara of the sand</b></i>" said Flare.</p><p>The Stands</p><p>"Flare-kun..." said Ellimere seeing him stand up again his eyes red with the kami-kitsune, kitsune dou. "He is now mostly likly equal to Gaara's strength now" said Naruto and Temari looked scared thinking '<i>Activating his bloodlimit macks him as strong as Garra?</i>'.</p><p>The Fight</p><p>Flare drew his katana, "Give up Garra" said Flare looking the Jinchuriki in the eye Gaara shook his head, "Then let's dance"</p><p>Stands(A/N I am sorry to go back and forth like this but I can't think of every moment of the fight)</p><p>"<i><b>If Gaara kills Flare I'll destroy him</b></i>" said Ellimere her eyes changing again, Naruto shook his head "He won't die he still has to marry you" said Naruto as Flare dodged a strike from the sand.</p><p>The Fight</p><p>Flare lost the grip on his katana as he jumped onto one of the walls "<i><b>That is it</b></i>" he said going through handseals, "<i><b>It looks like I ran out of chakra so time to reload, </b></i><i><u><b>KAGE CHAKRA NO JUTSU</b></u></i>!!" yelled Flare as he drained Gaara of his demonic chakra Flare noticed that he was not taking Gaara's normal chakra so he stopped. "Gaara to rely on Ichbi so much will-" Flare stopped when Suddenly he was caught in desert coffin(A/N If you know the japanise[sp spelling then feel free to tell me and I'll fix this), "<i><b>I forfit</b></i>" said Flare and he kage shunshined out of there just as Gaara tried to kill him. "<i><b>Gaara I am not that easy to kill even by crushing me</b></i>[6" said Flare and he walked up to Ellimere, "Sorry Elli-hime for worrying you" said Flare</p><p>Moments later</p><p>"Ok here is the(cough)line up for the(cough)main matches" said the proctor</p><p><i><u>Naruto vs. </u></i><i><u>Kynai Rune</u></i></p><p><i><u>Temari vs. Shikamaru</u></i></p><p><i><u>Ellimere vs. Gaara</u></i>(A/N Shit)</p><p><i><u>Ino vs. Dozu</u></i></p><p><i><u>Neji vs. kankuro</u></i></p><p>"You have a month to prepare good bye" said Sandaime as he left leaving everyone to their own devices<hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's note:</p><p>1.

Flare grabbed Ellimere and Shunshined to a restrant "I wanted to take you out before you go training" he whispered causing Ellimere to blush, "Flare-kun you don't have to you know" she responded and Flare shook his head. "Elli-hime I love you and I wanted to so yes I did"he said.</p><p>With Naruto</p><p>"Fuck he did it again" said Naruto as he watch them shunshin away going through handseals he summoned Kyuubi and he smiled when she smiled at him "Naru-kun you seem down" said Kyuubi as she hugged him, "It is just since we got back Flare has sent more time with Ellimere and hasn't been training me" said Naruto annoyed at the fact that every chance he gets with Flare Flare runs off to be with Ellimere but then again Ellimere isn't always with him so...</p><p>With Ellimere and Flare</p><p>"So Elli-hime what do you plan on training in?" asked Flare as he picked at his food that he had ordered, "I plan on training in all the fields Flare-kun you know I prefer to be well-rounded" said Ellimere and Flare laughed, "Yes, you do in <i>everything</i>" said Flare and he kissed her cheek "Just one thing don't get killed out there either in the matches or during training for them" said Flare looking her in the eye as she looked into his, "Flare-kun I can take care of mys-" she started to say when Flare shook his head "I know you can but Gaara is like you and unstable meaning he could do just about anything can and most likly will happen" said Flare.</p><p>With Naruto and Kyuubi</p><p>"Naru-kun do you want to go somewhere?" asked Kyuubi with an obvious reason hidden in there, "No, I- Yes, lets go" said Naruto catching himself fast enough. as they walked to his apartment the villagers gave Naruto glares of hate "Somethings never change but you know what villagers I don't give a flying fuck anymore so shut-up and leave me and Kyu-chan alone" said Naruto to the villagers who were stunned by his reaction and Kyuubi turned and smiled "Oh Naru-kun!" she said in a suductive manner and Naruto basicly turned a 180 and ran to her the villagers started to tell the girl off and Naruto got pissed "Why do you try to ruin every good thing I have huh? If it is not my house it is my health, if it is not my heath it is my relationships, you know what the next time you try any of that shit I'll let you deal the Kyuubi no kitsune as well as Kitsune Flare(A/N Ironic about the names huh?)" said Naruto beyond pissed and he and Kyuubi walked into his house leaving the villagers to sort out what he said and when they did they ran away from his house.</p><p>With Ellimere and Flare</p><p>Flare payed for the meal and Ellimere tried to get him to buy her a new outfit but not being totally whipped yet(A/N Unlike me -pouts-) he shook his head till she gave him the puppy dog eyes no jutsu(A/N I know I know a lot of people use that but I had to add it) then he said, "No"(A/N He never looked directly at her lol) and she started to complain "Elli-hime I'll buy you the dress sometime later I promise" said Flare and he heard somebody mummble "whipped" and Flare smiled '<i>Not entirly</i>' thought Flare as him and Ellimere walked to his appartment...</p><p>With um the other two...(A/N <i><u><b>WARNING LEMON WARNING LEMON</b></u></i>)(A/N I am not that good with lemons yet so cut me some slack)</p><p>Naruto and Kyuubi were laughing their asses off when the villagers realized what he had meant and after a few minutes of laughing Kyuubi pressed her lips against Naruto's. the kiss lasted for a couple minutes and soon they were starting to undress eachother. Naruto and Kyuubi got up while still kissing and walked to Naruto's room without breaking the kiss and as soon as they got to his room they headed to the bed and Kyuubi tripped on the edge landing underneath Naruto who caught himself before he crashed into Kyuubi "Kyu-chan are you ok?" he asked and Kyuubi answered with a kiss and wrapping her tails around him pulling him closer into a more passionate kiss that slowly changed into a tounge-war and as their tounges battled for domince in the other's mouth Naruto's and Kyuubi's hands were searching every part of the other's body soon one of Naruto's hands were on her breast and the other was on her lower back pulling her toward him. Kyuubi's hands were on his chest going through his chest hairs(A/N I am not that good on the female prespecive so no Flames for this) and she soon flipped them over and she was on top stradling his waist but not penitrated yet and she started to kiss down his chest only stopping at his bellybutton causing him to groan "Naru-kun do you want me to?" she asked suductivly and Naruto slowly nodded unable to form sentences now. She took him inside her mouth and started to go up and down on it licking it while she continued to suck on it "Kyu-chan I-I'm a-abo-ut t-to-" started Naruto and he came in her mouth and she swallowed all of it after it stopped she frowned because she wanted more(N/A I told you she was sex-starved!) she crawled back up to his lips and started to kiss him again the kiss quickly grew in passion and he started to grow stiff again as she pressed her tounge on his lips begging for entrance which he granted and and he tasted himself along with the taste of her mouth.</p><p>Quick break from them lets see what Ellimere and Flare are doing</p><p>Flare started to kiss Ellimere as soon as they closed the door to his appartment and as the kiss grew in intencity they lost more and more clothes and Flare walked backwards, not breaking the kiss, to his room and he broke the kiss and started to kiss down Ellimere's Neck and she moaned with each kiss and she pulled him with her as she fell onto the bed and she smiled at his weight "Flare-kun, you really want to do this right now?" she asked smiling and sounding suductive and Flare nodded still not used to her voice like that even after their first time. Flare and Ellimere kissed eachother as he entered her(A/N I am definatly not good at this part) and she gasped at the sudden feeling of being filled by Flare and he started to go in and out as she started to meet his rythme(A/N Spell check!)</p><p>Naruto and Kyuubi</p><p>Naruto entered Kyuubi and started to kiss her again as they started to moan and increase their speed. Soon they came at the sametime Naruto kissed Kyuubi weakly on the lips "Night Kyu-hime" he whispered before falling asleep.</p><p>Falre and Ellimere</p><p>"El-Elli-hi-hime I-I'm a-abo-out t-to c-cum" Flare managed to get out before he came and Ellimere feeling him cum caused her to climax and they fell down entirly onto the bed Flare kissed her forehead and smiled weakly "W-wow" was all he said, "Y-yeah" Ellimere relpied</p><p>(A/N <i><u><b>LEMON HAS FINISHED I REPEAT LEMON HAS FINISHED</b></u></i>)</p><p>The Next Morning</p><p>Flare woke up holding Ellimere remembering the night before he smiled '<i>What did I do to deserve someone as wonderful as her?</i>' he thought as he slipped out of her grasp to go take a shower while Ellimere slept</p><p>At Naruto's</p><p>Kyuubi woke up shocked that she had not returned to the seal when they had fallen asleep and she kissed Naruto waking him up "Morning Naru-kun" she said, "Morning Kyu-hime" said Naruto smiling and kissing her again and again "Naru-kun you have to go train" said Kyuubi through her purrs and Naruto smiled "I am, I'm getting more stamina" said Naruto and Kyuubi smiled Suductivly and pulled Naruto into a very deep and passionate kiss</p><p>Flare and Ellimere</p><p>Ellimere was waking up "Flare-kun?' she called as he stepped out of the shower and wrapped a towel around himself "Yes, Elli-hime?" asked Flare as he walked out into his room, "Oh Flare-kun I was wondering where you were" she said smiling Flare chuckled, "I noticed" he said and he kissed her cheek and grabbed himself some clothes and went into the bathroom and Ellimere pouted he wasn't snuggling her(A/N Demanding isn't she...).</p><p>With Ero-sennnin(A/N haven't been with him in a while)</p><p>Ero-sennin was in the Hokage's office "Sensie, Naruto, Ellimere, and Flare all deserve to become Chuunin if not Sannin already their strength <i>alone</i> is stronger then me each of them could beat me" said Ero-sennin surprising the Sandaime, "Jiriaya are you lieing to me?" asked Sandaime and with that ero-sennin shook his head and shunshined out of the office.<hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's note:</p><p>Writer: ...</p><p>Lee: Oops I must have ran around in a circle</p><p>Writer: I am not going to kill you but Rune-san said she wants you to <i><u><b>STOP BEING AN IDIOT!!</b></u></i></p><p>Lee: Ok I will</p><p>Writer: (facefaults)</p><p>Lee: What?</p><p>Writer: Um nothing R&R<hr size=1 width=100% noshade></p>

Or at least that is what might have happened if Ellimere didn't stop him "Flare-kun if he refuses to listen to me then nothing will work" said Ellimere and Flare nodded, "Ok Elli-hime" said Flare and they continued their way to the training field only for Sandaime shunshin infront of Flare "I want to talk to you" said the Sandaime. "What do you want?" asked Flare not in the mood to be polite, "Alone..." replied Sandaime, "I'll tell you alone". With that Flare nodded "See you in a bit Ellimere" said Flare as him and Sandaime shunshined away to his office and Flare stood infront of the desk "Sit Flare" said Sandaime and Flare complide while he sat Sandiame went to the door in his office that did not lead out of it and pulled out a jounin vest "I was told you were already tready to wear this but" said Sandiame putting it back Flare raised his eyebrow in a confused fasion, "Here" Sandiame tossed him a chuunin vest, You've been premoted and so has your team even if they lose in the chuunin exam" and Flare nodded. "Yes Hokage-sama" said Flare now chuunin(A/N Remember he lost at the end of the match against Gaara) he stood up, "Thank you sir" and Flare shunshined to Ellimere and Naruto in his new vest and he was hit with a barrage of questions. Flare shook his head "You'll see after the exams" said Flare and he got into his stance waiting for them to charge and the training started.</p><p>A while later</p><p>Flare was the only one standing and that was because he had activated the kitsune dou panting he said, "<i><b>Damn you guys are tougher then you look</b></i>" and he walked over to Naruto and Ellimere both of them were healing fairly fast and Flare deactivated the kitsune dou and fell onto his butt. "Naruto, Elli-hime I think you guys are going to win" said Flare as he smiled knowing that they were already chuunin even if they did not win the exam.</p><p>The re-meeting of Jiriaya</p><p>Naruto was working on the Hiraishin no jutsu near the hot springs and Ero-sennin was peeping again and Naruto smiled "<u>Katon Kai No Jutsu</u>[1!" said NAruto burning the unfortunate sannin "WHAT THE HELL?!?" yelled Ero-sennin and Naruto laughed till tehe prevert decided to 'punish' Naruto and he summoned Gamabunta Naruto Frowned "Hey Gamabunta I hope you like reunions" said Naruto going through the handseals "<u>Kitsune Guardian Kuchiyose No Jutsu</u>!" and he summoned Kyuubi and jumped onto her head "Hey kyu-hime" said Naruto kissing her between the eyes Kyuubi saw the toad "Naru-kun why did you summon me I hate that vile creature" said Kyuubi.</p><p>I am not in the mood to listen so on to Flare and Ellimere's day of training</p><p>Flare was dodging Ellimere's strikes and she dodged his neither of them used either Demon or bloodlimit and Flare was getting beat but not as bad as usual he side stepped her stab with a kunai and he tripped her and she landed on the floor "Elli-hime if I was Gaara you would have died please go <i>all</i> out on me" said Flare and she nodded and she attacked him.</p><p>With the sandaime</p><p>"What the...?" said Sandaime as he felt chakra spike and he lookedout the window to see the Kyuubi and Gamabunta fighting eachother and he sweatdropped as he looked down seeing the villagers trying to break in and kill him for keeping that 'demon boy' alive and he shunshined down and handed them a telescope and they saw Naruto was on top of the kyuubi meaning he had summoned it the villagers did not feel totally relaxed at that revulation infact they remembered what he had said...</p><p><u>Flashback</u></p><p><i>the villagers gave Naruto glares of hate "Somethings never change but you know what villagers I don't give a flying fuck anymore so shut-up and leave me and Kyu-chan alone" said Naruto to the villagers who were stunned by his reaction and Kyuubi turned and smiled </i><b>"Oh Naru-kun!" </b><i>she said in a suductive manner and Naruto basicly turned a 180 and ran to her the villagers started to tell the girl off and Naruto got pissed "Why do you try to ruin every good thing I have huh? If it is not my house it is my health, if it is not my heath it is my relationships, you know what the next time you try any of that shit I'll let you deal the Kyuubi no kitsune as well as Kitsune Flare(A/N Ironic about the names huh?)" said Naruto</i></p><p><u>End Flashback</u></p><p>"He can summon that creature anytime he wants we have to kill him next time he falls asleep" said one of the villagers just then Ellimere and Flare had shunshined to the hokage's office and frowned "How dare you threaten my teammate like that" said Flare is kami-kitsune active and looking at them venom in his voice and eyes the villagers looked at him "Do you even know <i>what</i> he is?" asked one of them and Flare laughed, "Of course I know what he is but you don't seem to he is the <i>jailor</i> not the demon you fucking imbasules(A/N Spell check!)" said Flare laughing still and Ellimere smiled sadisticly "And I am like Naruto a Jinchuriki and just one tail weaker then him isn't that scary for you the best team here is team Biju and we consist of two Jinchuriki and one Biju Guardian" Flare nodded in agreement, "I can summon <i>any</i> biju I want so don't piss me or Elli-hime off" said Flare and he kage-shunshined out of there with Ellimere.</p><p>With Lee(A/N I want to see how him and Rune-san are doing)</p><p>Lee was waiting outside the Kynai estate for Rune like she had asked him too soon she came out and grabbed his hand "Comeon let go" she said sweetly which was unlike her with her teammates, "Ok Rune-san" said Lee and she put her finger to his lips "You can call me Rune-chan if you want" she said softly and she kissed him.</p><p>Flare and Ellimere</p><p>Flare kissed Ellimere on the lips "Elli-hime do you think you had enough training today?' asked Flare wanting to know what she thought and she nodded, "Yeah I feel as if I was fighting for two though" said Ellimere and Flare fell <i><u><b>THROUGH</b></u></i> the floor, "You have got to be fucking kidding me!" he said not that he did not want children just not yet, "No Flare-kun but maybe I sho-" she started but Flare was already kissing her. "Even if you aren't kidding me" said Flare pulling away, "I don't want you to leave" and with that Ellimere pulled him into a deep kiss.<hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Note:</p><p>1.

Kyuubi smiled <b>"I'll see you later Naru-kun"</b> said Kyuubi before she left and Naruto landed hard on the ground but stood up just as ero-sennin got back on to his feet.

"If you tell me the name of my father and teach me how to use the Hiraishin no jutsu" and Jiriaya stiffened. "Why would you want to know those things?" asked Ero-sennin and Naruto shrugged, "You don't have to tell me cause I find out later through Kyu-hime or Flare-san" said Naruto and yet again he(Ero-sennin) was fearful about Flare, "But if you don't tell me your status will become S-rank Nuke-nin(S-rank Missing nin)" Naruto grinning sadisticly till, "Fine gaki but your not going to like it" said Jiriaya and Naruto shrugged(A/N Being with a sadist someimes rubs off on you but me I am more sadistic then most heck I think Orochimaru would be scared of me -starts to sharpen kunai and Shuriken- anyway I have to get back to writing), "Your father is the Yondaime, and the secret to use that jutsu died with him" Naruto smiled sadly, "I was right..." and he walked away.</p><p>Ok so I do not go crazy lets go check on Flare</p><p>Flare was blocking an attack to his team's medic and he was getting pissed "<i><b>Gaki hurry up</b></i>" said Flare as he had the Kitsune dou active '<i>Damn Itachi bringing not only his teammate but that damned puppet user and bomb fanatic</i>' thought Flare.</p><hr size=1 width=100% noshade>Author's Note:

Ellimere smiled and looked at her, "Because he is my teammate and the strongest one at that, He deserves a good match" said Ellimere Temari looked a her in awe usually when she saw a teammate of someone the teammate was wishing they were out there in the match. "Flare-kun is going to have a field day when I go out for my match" said Ellimere suddenly Temari suddenly remembered that she was going against Gaara, "I am sorry for you" she(Temari) said and Ellimere glaced at her, "Eh don't worry about me worry about Gaara No Baka" said Ellimere.</p><p><u><b>First Match of The Semi-Finals</b></u></p><p><u><b>Uzumaki Naruto of Konohagakure vs. Kynai Rune of Konohagakure</b></u></p><p>Naruto was basicly sitting in the arena when Rune walked down and he didn't move he just smiled, "Hello Rune-san" said Naruto and she jumpe she thought somehow he had fallen asleep. "Hello Naruto-san" said Rune as Naruto stood and opened his eyes to the Ingan and Rune sneered, "You thief" Naruto shrugged his shoulders, "I maybe a thief but at least I 'took' it with permission" said Naruto. And the Fight began...</p><p>In the stands</p><p>Two chuunins were talking about Naruto, "I'm surprised he made it this far" said one of them, "Just goes to show luck plays a part too" said the other.</p><p>Flare</p><p>Flare was watching the match when he started to think about Ellimere and he kage-shunshined into the room where the rest of the could-be Chuunins were and he wrapped his arms around Ellimere, "Hello Elli-hime" said Flare into her ear before starting kissing her neck and Ellimere leaned her head to the side allowing Flare more acess and he nipped at her sensitive area of neck luckily they were in a secluded spot in the room as she moaned, "Flare-kun I can't-" Ellimere started and Flare pulled his head away, "I know, but I couldn't get you out of my mind" Flare replied and Ellimere turned around and pressed her lips to his Flare smiled into the kiss before pulling away, "Elli-hime I don't care if you win or lose just survive, you maybe the second strongest on the team but still Gaara is still dangerous" Ellimere gave him a look before realizing he was genuinely worried for her, "Flare-kun I will survive after all we have a family to make" said Ellimere and Flare paled for just a second before color return to his face and he smiled and nodded, "More then you know" he whispered into her ear before shunshining to the Hokage and Kazekage leaving her to ponder his word just for a second before they registered and then she turn bright red and her nose started to bleed a bit as perverted thoughts ran through her head.</p><p>Match</p><p>Naruto blocked Rune's punch and kicked at at her. Naruto was holding his own only because during Rune's match against Rock Lee he had used the Sharingan to memorize the movments. Rune jumped away and smirked, "Well well well, it seems you are lasting longer then Lee-kun did, but you know something? The wave style can shut chakra points just like the Juuken style" said Rune and Naruto shrugged, "I am a Hyuuga's worst nightmare" said Naruto still in his stance and Rune attacked him slowly shutting his chakra points one by one and then Naruto couldn't use jutsu, "Well what are you going to do now Uzumaki-san" said Rune and Naruto looked up he had fallen on the ground, "It's Kazama" said Naruto standing up.</p><p><i>Oh, the power to be strong<br>

Naruto smiled, "So You ready for a true match?" he asked a sadistic smile on his face.
