then Exiled</p><P>They
where in the Valley of End fighting it out. Sasuka and Naruto duking
it out. Sasuka with his cursed seal at level two. His skin looking a
light dirty grey, with black bat looking wings that came out of his
back, and with a cross across his nose.</p><P>Naruto
looking like he has gone to heel and back. His eyes slited, bloder
wisker marks, inch long claw and k9, and nine golden looking charka
tail on his back.</p><P>Naruto
summoned Kyuubi while Sasuka summoned Orochi.</p><P>While Orochi and Kyuubi
were fighting Sasuka and Naruto were charging there last attacks.
Naruto using Ounto Rasagon and Sasuka using Ounto Chidori. Naruto
jumped off the Fire's side of the valley while Sasuka jumped off
the Rice's side of the valley walls. As they were about to colloid
with each other in mid air Naruto moves his arms slightly wider so he
could so he could attack Sasuka's wings knocking him out with out
killing him.</p><P>He succeed in knocking
him out, but in return getting two holes in his chest. Kyuubi just
finished off Orochi so she went over to where Naruto was. When she
got there she saw Naruto holding Sasuka bribe style. Naruto jumped
onto Kyuubi's head, and told her to go pick up everybody else and
take them back to Konoha.</p><P>Kyuubi did just as she
was told. She even picked up the sand siblings. As they were
approaching Konoha everybody was asleep except Naruto who was healing
everybody. When they approach the gates all the villager's and
ninga's came to see where all the charka was coming for. When they
got there they were frozen on spot. The reason why was because they
saw the Kyuubi. When Kyuubi reached the gates Naruto woke everybody
up except Sasuka. He told everybody to jump off, and they did what he
said. Then Naruto told Kyuubi to shrink her size so she could fit
into the village and she did just that .</p><P>When everybody saw who
was on the Kyuubi they were surprised that it was the same person
that they hated and dispised. It was Naruto he also had somebody in
his arms. It was there presies Sasuka. Naruto then got off of Kyuubi
and started to walk in the village. There was some medicnin's there
so he gave Sasuka to them. After he Sakura run up to him and slaped
him.</p><P>"Why did you hurt
Sasuka-kun? She asked.</p><P>He replied' no
Sakura I only knock him out son I could being hem back. Oh ya that
remind's me that I have to take away the cursed mark.'</p><P>With that said he
walked over to Sasuka and lays his left hand on Sasuka's seal. He
then focus some charka to draw the seal and the dark charka with it
in himself after that was done he told kyuubi to come on. Kyuubi hops
on his neck and Naruto startes to walk off to the Hokaga's office.
When he gets there he told Kyuubi to let no one to mess with him
except Jiraiya or Tsunade. He then fell asleep on the couch in the
office</p>
