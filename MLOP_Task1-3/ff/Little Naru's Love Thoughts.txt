Sexy
rape...I am a yaoi freak!! XD</P><P>Disclaimer: I don't own
Naruto or Sasuke!! I wish...it would be all yaoi if so! XD</P><P>Sasuke POV (point of view)</P><P>I wanted to kill you, but
my mind told me otherwise.</P><P>I couldn't stop thinking
of how your body could hold up so much, and to be able to still want
to keep your bond with me.</P><P>I didn't stop though, I
needed to break that bond so that I could become stronger and kill my
brother.</P><P>You yelled at me with
sadness and angry melting together in this sea of friendship, it made
my mind blur as you stood over me.</P><P>I could feel your heat as
you held me close, I couldn't understand, before you were beating the
shit out of me and now you're hugging me. I felt your entire body
holding me closer, you then pulled back and looked into my eyes.</P><P>I couldn't stop himself
from staring at your beautiful blue eyes, I then realized what I had
done. I found myself kissing your lips, I could feel your body
wanting more.</P><P>My mind then began to
conduct a plan, I knew that this was how to break my bond with you.</P><P>I jumped on top of you and
began to pull off your pants and my own, I then tied up your hands
with rope as I began to rape your precious body.</P><P>I could tell it was your
first as you began to bleed as I went faster, you screamed in pain. I
didn't want you to enjoy it, I wanted you hate me for it.</P><P>I then felt myself release
my tension, with you still screaming in pain.</P><P>I pulled back on my pants
as you fainted from your ordeal, I walked off as I left you to hate
me and wanting me out of your life forever.</P><P>I still held my own battle
of wits as I walked away, my own mind battle.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Contains: Blood...and
angsting!</P><P>Disclaimer: I don't own
anything related to Naruto!</P><P>Naruto's POV</P><P>I couldn't believe it, you
left me on the ground to die from blood loss. You ran off as I lie on
the ground, my pants thrown of to the side.</P><P>I sat up, and groaned from
the pain. I grabbed my discarded clothing, trying not to lose my
dignity in the process. I stood up as blood fell down my legs, it
bled through as I began to walk back to the village.</P><P>I didn't care anymore, you
could burn in hell for all I care. My demon, Kyuubi no Kitsune, could
feel my pain as he tried to heal me. He could heal my physical pain,
but not my emotional pain.</P><P>You had broken my heart, I
had loved you, but you only wanted revenge by killing your brother.</P><P>I tried to untie my hands
as I walked through the forest back to the village, I didn't care
about anything anymore, all I cared about was leaving this place.</P><P>I didn't want to remember
anything, I wanted to forget. All of the days we were friends, all
the days we sat together on our missions.</P><P>I felt my anger growing,
my body became cover in the foxes chakra.</P><P>I then saw Kakashi running
towards me, he could tell that I was hurt. I knew he didn't
understand how, I felt my mind racing.</P><P>I jumped away as the
silver-haired ninja tried to comfort me, he looked shocked by my
actions.</P><P>I could see through his
actions towards me, somehow I could hear him even though he wasn't
speaking. I could hear his words of hate and fear, he wanted me died
and that's all he ever wanted. He kept tell himself a plan to kill me
for hurt his "Dolphin-chan," I didn't understand who he was
speaking about until the name Iruka was said.</P><P>I looked back at him in
fear, and disgust, I screamed at him as I ran over to him. I could
fell the Kyuubi's chakra creating his tails behind me, I could feel
the pain as I controlled myself from getting four of my tails.</P><P>I told him, in my mind, to
wait till I get to the village. He happily understood, I hated that
village all my life. I wanted it gone and I wanted myself to forget,
to forget my love loss.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Contains: Bloody
violence...and angsting!</P><P>Disclaimer: I do NOT own
Naruto or anything related to him.</P><P>Naruto's POV</P><P>" No! " I
screamed as I ran to Kakashi, my arm holding him off the ground.</P><P>His sharingan eye looked
back at me, he could see my body movements, but not Kyuubi's
movements.</P><P>I could say that from
experience, Sasuke had tried to see me with his eyes before it
happened. He was too slow and I was just about to lay the finally
blow, but I couldn't do it. I grabbed him, and he responded my
forcing me into losing my virginity to him. I hated him for that, and
I knew that's what he wanted.</P><P>" But Naruto.. "</P><P>" NO! " He
stared back at he as I growled loudly, he was a few feet of the
ground.</P><P>He strained for his words,
but I didn't want to hear his lies. " You hate me and I know it,
I can see right through you! " He looked confused by my words, I
didn't explain it to him, because I threw him into a tree instead.</P><P>I growled and screamed at
the same time as I ran off to the village, Kyuubi chuckled as he took
over my body.</P><P>" You finally learned
kit, all humans are cold-hearted. They are eviler then me, and that
is hard to believe. I will give you options, if you want them, first,
do you want to keep anyone alive? " I searched through the town
quietly as I tired to hear anyones kind thoughts towards me, I could
hear nothing of the sort.</P><P>I could only hear hate for
me in everyone's thoughts, even Iruka had hate full intentions for
me. He hated me, he didn't say anything about the fox. He didn't even
think of the fact that I didn't choose this, or the fact that I never
got my say in the matter.</P><P>I stood over the village,
all I could think of was his face. I have never seen him smile, and I
mean a full-on smile, not a fake halfway smile, a giant grin.</P><P>" What are you
thinking kit, you don't want him anymore. "</P><P>" I know I don't, "
I said out loud to the fox, I loved the demon for never hating me, "
but... Can you do something for my Kyuu-kun? " I could see his
smile as I found myself sitting next to the large demon, and he
shrunk to my knees as a larger form of a red fox.</P><P>He jumped in my lap as I
sat on the cold ground, his nine-tails wrapped around my body.</P><P>" Anything for you my
kit, what is bothering you. I don't like to look through to your
thoughts, so I never know what is bugging you. "</P><P>" And I thank you for
that, " I wrapped my arms around the fox, he put his head over
my shoulder like what a normal person would do, " I was wonder
if you were able to make people forget. " The Kyuubi looked down
at me as I began to hug him around his shoulders.</P><P>" I can, if that's
what you really want. For you, I can do anything. Just give me the
word, and it'll be yours. " I cried strongly as I held the fox
closer, and he licked my face as I still held his shoulders.</P><P>" Than...thank
you...Kyuu-kun! " The fox smiled as I laid down with him as the
cold mental room turned to a lush green garden, he tails still
wrapped around my body.</P><P>" I will begin, it
doesn't take that long, for you being as old as you are. When you
wake, you will no longer remember. I will remind you about killing
them, you being the one to go along, I know you will oblige to my
negotiations. " I laughed as he went along with me, he laid on
the grassy floor.</P><P>I laid on top of his lush
fur as I closed my eyes, and fell asleep. I soon found myself sitting
on top of of the Hokage mountian, I knew where I was.</P><P>All he did was make me
forget the people, and my friendship and hardships with them.</P><P>I only remember my name
and the place I was, I didn't remember what was this place to me. I
don't remember my life here, but I remember the name and the places
around it.</P><P>I then heard his voice, I
knew who he was, he would never make me forget him. " Naruto, do
you remember why you are here? "</P><P>" Am I here to kill
Kyuu-sensei, can you help me though? " He nodded as he covered
me in his chakra, he gave me the option of watching.</P><P>I was overcome with blood
lust from the fox, and I agreed to watch, but he did not want me to
partake in the onslaught.</P><P>He didn't want me to
anyway, in case of anything, he wanted me to learn how first. I
completely understood, he over took me as all nine tails formed out
of my body.</P><P>He had broken the seal,
but he wanted to stay. He as learned how to love, and he says that to
me all the time.</P><P>He killed everyone he came
in contact with, and I saw most people screaming my name as the fox
killed them in a sea of blood. My hands were covered in their blood,
and I watched as thousands of ninja swarmed around me.</P><P>Kyuubi laughed as he
quickly slaughtered the rest of the village residents, and I finally
felt him pull back. I walked around the town, and all I could see
were bodies everywhere.</P><P>I didn't care, I heard
people saying my name as they slowly left their bodies.</P><P>I wondered about what
would happened when you die, and I looked back into my mind as I sat
at the Hokage mountian once again.</P><P>I walked over to the red
fox, then I was standing over him. I sat down in his fur, and it felt
so soft.</P><P>" What are you wonder
about my kit, do you want something else. I have all the power in the
world to do anything, anything you want. "</P><P>" Anything? "
The fox laughed lightly as I looked up at him like a little child,
and I smiled as he licked my face.</P><P>" Yes, anything you
wish. " I thought to myself as I sat with him, I wanted so much.</P><P>" What about turning
me into a immortal demon like you, into a red fox, then both of us
making sure that people don't forget to obey you. " He grinned
at my thoughts, he is evil, but not as evil as humans.</P><P>I didn't want to be a
human, I wanted to be a demon like him.</P><P>" Sure, anything for
you. You will awake once more, but this time as a fox. How about you
become a blond fox with blue eyes, that way people can easily tell
that it is you they are looking at. You will be my right hand man,
and what you say goes. " I nodded my head, I grinned up at him.</P><P>" Oh, " I stood
up and began to trace my fingers on my whisker scars, " and show
my scars, that will help them as well! " He nodded as I began to
hug him, he purred as I found myself standing a little bit under the
fox.</P><P>I noticed my fox paws, I
looked back at my tail.</P><P>" You will earn a
tail for every one thousand year, you will earn your power in time. "
I saw the village as I walked out with the fox not too far behind,
and I walked along his side as I found my true calling as a demon. I
was finally able to forget the pain and hurt in my old life.</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer: I don't own Naruto.</P><P>Naruto POV still</P><P>I scambered over to Kyuubi and my one tail shook behind me. I could feel my whiskers tracing my whisker-like scars, three on each side of my face.</P><P>I couldn't stop jumping around with excitement, and that made Kyuubi's eyes shimmer with love.</P><P>I stopped as Kyuubi looked up to find someone coming close, and ever since we went off, no one wants to go near us. My blond fur and Kyuubi's fur is too blinding for anyone not to notice our presence.</P><P>I could feel the persons chakra was familiar, then I saw him. His black hair, and onyx eyes, but no one was standing with him.</P><P>Kyuubi told me about him, and how I knew him. He didn't tell me why I left him, but he told me that it was a good enough reason.</P><P>I thought he went to Orochimaru, but it looked like he was gone. I knew that he wouldn't stand Orochimaru too long, and would get rid of him as soon as he got the chance.</P><P>I stood closer to Kyuubi, and the large fox sat up. He stared at the man, but I knew that he already noticed us. I knew who he was, Sasuke, he walked towards us.</P><P>" I want to challenge you. " The raven man said as he stood in front of us, and I stared back, wondering if he would remember me just by my attributes.</P><P>Kyuubi walked forward, and formed a tall man. His red fur had moved to his head, and his ears and tails still showed.</P><P>He always loved to look formal everytime he fought anyone, and I loved it too. Me and Kyuubi had formed a bond, but very different then a father son bond, no, we love each other like couples.</P><P>" I will battle you, but if you lose, you most work for me. " I loved how he shook fear into the air just by his voice, and he knew it.</P><P>Sasuke smirked, but he looked back at me.</P><P>" I would like to see the power in you, but I'm interested in your right hand "man." I have heard many things about him, and I would like to test his strength. " Kyuubi lifted a eyebrow, and he turned his head back to me.</P><P>" He asked for it, and he'll just have to learn. " He chuckled as I walked over to Kyuubi, and I stared back up at him.</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>Warning: contains boyxboy
kissing.</P><P>Disclaimer: I don't own
Naruto.</P><P>" What? " Sasuke
asked, and I still looked up at the man.</P><P>" Sorry, he hasn't
turned into a human for a while, and I think he forgot. " He
chuckled, but Sasuke just stayed looking as emotionless as ever. "
I think you should battle me first, " Sasuke finally showed
emotion as he looked back in confusion, " because he has
overpowered me many times when we train. He has become even more
powerful then me, being as young as he is, and he as learned a lot in
his lifetime. " Sasuke smirked, and I sat back down.</P><P>Kyuubi began his fighting
stance, and Sasuke began his own. They began their fight, but I knew
what would happen. Kyuubi would stand over him and land the finally
blow, as same as always.</P><P>This time I watched the
"ending, " and he held up Sasuke by his jacket collar. "
Any last words? " I could see the smirk on Sasuke's face, and I
could see his plan even before it started.</P><P>I could feel my body
running to them, I jumped, and tackled Sasuke to the ground.</P><P>I could see the kunai
knife in his hand, and he was just about to slit my throat. I bit
down on the knife, and that seemed to shake fear through his body.</P><P>Even though I was
one-tenth his size, I somehow was able to hold him down.</P><P>Then I noticed my body had
returned to my human form, and Sasuke was shaken by the sight of me
on top of him.</P><P>" Naruto..I.. "
I growled at him, and I saw Kyuubi walked over to us.</P><P>He picked me back up as I
put the knife in my hand, and I looked down at Sasuke laying on the
ground. He still held shock in his expression, and I smirked at him.</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>Warning: Boyxboy kissing.</P><P>Disclaimer: I don't own
Naruto.</P><P>" I would kill you
right now, but Kyuubi tells me that it's unfair to beat humans if
they can't fight back. " He didn't stop from staring, and Kyuubi
growled at him.</P><P>His fox tails wrapped
around my body, my fox tail shook from behind me. His fox ears poked
out of the side of his head as he lightly placed a kiss on my lips,
and my own fox ears slowly curved down as I kissed back.</P><P>I smirked as I could see
Sasuke still staring, and I could still see his love for me in his
eyes. I pulled back, and held my arms around Kyuubi's torso.</P><P>" I'm Naruto's and
you lost your chance years ago. You should have thought twice before
you did what you did, but I was able to bring him back his "youth"
and he was glad to lose it once again to me. I love him more then you
even did, or could. " Sasuke stood up, and still stared at us.</P><P>I sighed, and I looked at
Kyuubi. He knew what I wanted, and he nodded his head.</P><P>" Sorry Sasuke, but
this is the best. " He looked confused as Kyuubi put his hand in
front of his face.</P><P>His red chakra covered
Sasuke's head, and his eyes slowly closed. I grabbed him in my arms
before he fell, and we both walked out of the forest.</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer I don't own
Naruto.</P><P>" Do you want to make
sure that they keep him safe, I know you still have some feelings
about him, and I wouldn't mind having something to do. " Kyuubi
chuckled, and I smiled back at him.</P><P>I jumped into the trees
and looked back at the Hidden Leaf Village. I still didn't remember,
but I still could feel my feelings of Sasuke.</P><P>I jumped into the air, and
on top of the village's hospital. I placed him on the ground as I
heard someone running up the stairs, and I returned to my fox form. I
then saw Kyuubi do the same, and I saw a pink haired girl opening the
door.</P><P>Kyuubi quickly told me
about her, and I shivered at the thought of me having a crush on her.</P><P>" Sasuke! " She
ran over to him, and she stopped as she noticed us.</P><P>We had become very famous
in this village for the many people that tried to ignore Kyuubi's
power. She slowly walked over to us, and still stared as she picked
up the raven boy in her arms.</P><P>She slowly walked over to
the door, and she looked back as we followed. She opened the door,
she knew what we were doing, and left the door open for us.</P><P>I shut the door with my
tail, and I followed her to one of the hospital rooms. She laid him
on a bed, and just about everyone looked into the room as me and
Kyuubi sat on the foot of the bed.</P><P>Kyuubi growled as people
tried to crowd us, and I laid my head down on the bed. Kyuubi did the
same, but I closed my eyes as he stayed watch.</P><P>I smirked as Kyuubi licked
my ear, and everyone stared at us. Kyuubi growled loudly, and
everyone walked back.</P><P>A tall women walked over
to us, and he breast were huge. I didn't like women anyway, so I
didn't look.</P><P>Kyuubi looked up, and I
could tell that he respected her. I decided to look up at her since
Kyuubi held respect for her, and she stood before us.</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P>Disclaimer: I don't own
Naruto.</P><P>" I know why you're
here, Naruto. " I looked up, but I didn't care, I knew that no
one cares about me enough to care.</P><P>Only Kyuubi loved me, and
I only loved him.</P><P>" Naruto? "
Sakura looked at me with amazment, but I didn't look back.</P><P>I still looked up at the
other women.</P><P>" Tsunade, that's
Naruto? " I saw the women nodding her head, and I felt my tail
shaking behind me.</P><P>" Don't worry, I
promise that nothing will happen to Sasuke. " I nodded, and I
felt my body forming my "human" form.</P><P>I was no longer a human,
but I still I had my human body.</P><P>Everyone gaspsed as I felt
my hair falling down to my chest, I never cut my hair, so my hair had
grown pretty long.</P><P>I then felt Kyuubi putting
his arm around my shoulder, and I looked back at him. He stared at
Tsunade, and he nodded.</P><P>" I only want one
thing, " Tsunade nodded, but everyone looked back shocked, "
let us live in your village. I want Naruto to still be able to live
out his teenage years. " She nodded once again, and I stood up
from the bed, and Kyuubi stood beside me.</P><P>Kyuubi began to walk out
of the room, and I soon followed. Everyone looked back at the raven
boy as we left, and Kyuubi soon began to kiss my neck.</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><P>Warning: Boyxboy kissing.</P><P>Disclaimer: I don't own
Naruto.</P><P>" Kyuu-kun, I missed
having you as a human. We were so busy with our job that I missed
your touches, and I want you so bad. I just wish I could be seme one
day, maybe today? " The fox demon smirked, and kissed my lips.</P><P>He then placed his lips
near my ear, and his breathe felt so warming</P><P>" Sure, it's your
birthday anyway. " I giggled, and I wrapped my arms around his
neck.</P><P>" I'll be sure to
make you happy, " I slowly placed my head near his ear,</P><P>" and I know you'll
like it. " He blushed lightly, but he quickly smiled as we
formed back into our fox forms.</P><P>We ran over to my old
apartment, and I jumped through the hole in the door.</P><P>Kyuubi jumped into the bed
and turned back into his human form, and I did the same as I jumped
on top of him.</P><P>I couldn't stop grinning
as I nipped at his neck, and then I pulled away at his shirt. He did
the same to my own shirt, and began to lick at his toned chest.</P><P>He moaned loudly as I
pinched at his right nipple, and my other hand held his hair.</P><P>My body wanted more, and
even though Kyuubi left my body years ago, I still carried his
animalistic intentions.</P><P>I pulled off Kyuubi's
pants, and he smirked at my quick actions. I put my hand down his
boxers, and began to rub his strong erection.</P><P>" Nar...Naru... "</P><P>" You like that
Kyuu-kun? " I tried to sound as sexy as possible, and it seemed
to work.</P><P>He nodded, and then I
pulled away at my pants. My boxers soon fell with them, and I did the
same to Kyuubi's.</P><P>" Naruto... "</P><P>" Say it, pweeze? "
I licked at his hard erection, and he lightly bucked as he yelled in
passion.</P><P>" NARUTO-SEME!! "
I smirked, I moved my mouth away and I licked at my fingers.</P><P>I thrusted my own
erection, and then quickly smiled at Kyuubi and kissed at his neck. "
Naru.. " I kissed his lips, and he kissed back.</P><P>My tongue fought with
Kyuubi's, and just for today, Kyuubi let me win. I licked at every
square-inch of his wet cavern, and I loved the taste.</P><P>I then thrusted my own
pleading erection into him, and he moaned loudly.</P><P>" Kyuu...kun. "
I moaned his name as I thrusted back and fourth.</P><P>I licked at his lips, and
he kept moaning as I went faster.</P><P>"
Naru...please...faster! " I licked away at his chest as I
quickly obeyed, and I left love bites on his neck as I went up. "
NARUTO!! "</P><P>" KYUUBI!! " We
both screamed each other's names as we both came together, and his
cum covered my mouth.</P><P>I licked at my lips, and
fell onto Kyuubi's chest.</P><P>" Thank you,
Naru-seme. " He chuckled as he held me closer, and my head laid
onto his left shoulder.</P><P>His arms wrapped around my
shoulders, and mine wrapped around his torso. I smiled, I kissed his
neck, and he kissed my forehead.</P><P>He placed the blanket over
our bodies, and I closed my eyes as I fell asleep in his loving grip.</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 10</h3><hr><br><P>Warning: Boyxboy action,
but just kissing.</P><P>Disclaimer I don't own
Naruto.</P><P>" Naruto is seme? "
I opened my eyes to find Sakura staring down at me, and I would have
blushed by how close she was but I only care for Kyuubi.</P><P>I then realized Kyuubi was
still asleep, and he still had his arms around my shoulders.</P><P>" Yes, so what, it
was my eighteen birthday. So he let me be seme for my birthday, and
for your information, he LOVED it. " She blushed, and she stood
up straight.</P><P>I flet Kyuubi's breathe
against my face as I laid my head back onto his chest, but Sakura
still stared. " What? " She blushed even stronger, and I
felt Kyuubi's grip tighten.</P><P>" You better leave, I
know you were watching last night, and I'm warning you beforehand. "
She walked out of the room, and I could see the dry blood on her
clothing.</P><P>" Was I really that
sexy to make her bleed? " Kyuubi smiled at me, and placed a kiss
on my lips.</P><P>" You were even
sexier to me, and you are always going to be sexy. " I giggled,
and I looked up at him.</P><P>" I want to ask you a
question? " Kyuubi smiled at me, and kissed me.</P><P>" What is it my
little kitsune? " I blushed at him, and that made him look
concerned.</P><P>" Would you hate me
if I told you that I used a jutsu that I learned to be able to bare
children yesterday when I went into the forest? " He still held
his grin, and I knew he didn't mind.</P><P>" Why would I get
angry, I'd love for you to be able to bare our children, and I knew
you did already. I could tell by they way you acted, and I could hear
your pain after you used the jutsu. " I began to cry, and Kyuubi
tightened his grib on me.</P><P>" I'm so happy, and I
can't wait till I have our own child! " I wrapped my legs around
his torso, and he kissed my neck.</P><P>I pushed my face into his
hair, and shook my head into his lushish locks.</P><P>" Me neither, and I
bet it's be soon. I can already tell that your going to become
pregnant. "</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 11</h3><hr><br><P>Warning: Boyxboy kissing,
and loving.</P><P>Disclaimer: I don't own
Naruto.</P><P>" You can tell? "
He nodded his head, and kissed my chest.</P><P>" I had a sister
before, and I had the uncanny ability to tell if anyone was was
pregnant or not. She had been trying to have a kid for a while, so
she asked me every time she had done it with her husband. " I
smirked, and he licked at my neck.</P><P>" I would like to met
her, she sounds like a nice women. " He smirked, but he still
licked away at my skin.</P><P>He left his mark as he
sucked at my tender neck, and I moaned lightly.</P><P>" You won't have to
wait. " I opened my eyes to find a fox women staring at me as
she sat on the window sill, she had white fur, and white hair.</P><P>" I've heard a lot
about you, " she then looked at Kyuubi, " and I missed you
Nii-san. " Kyuubi didn't look up, so he still kissed my neck. "
You seem happy Nii-san, but you could least tell your little sister
hello. "</P><P>" Hello. " He
then quickly went back to kissing my neck, and she pouted at him.</P><P>I chuckled, and looked up
at her.</P><P>" What's your name,
I'm Naruto. " The fox girl smirked at me, and her long white
hair fell to her chest as she jumped into the room.</P><P>I tried to look at her,
but Kyuubi held his grip. " Come on Kyuu-kun, I want to meet
her! " He growled lightly, but he still licked at my neck. "
Pweeze? " I tried to sound cute, and Kyuubi looked up at me.</P><P>He released his grip and I
quickly kissed his lips. I stood up from the bed, and Kyuubi had his
arm around my torso.</P>

little sister. "</P><P>" I'm not that
younger then you, we are only one year apart, and you know it. "
Kyuubi smirked as she pouted at him.</P><P>" It's nice to meet
you, Kaki-san. " She smiled at me, and she wrapped her arm
around my shoulder opposite to Kyuubi.</P><P>" I love him already!
" I smiled, but Kyuubi looked angry at her.</P><P>" Don't worry
Kyuu-kun, you know I only love you, and only you. " Kyuubi
kissed my neck, his sister and me giggled as walked out of my
apartment.</P><P>I then saw I tall teenage
boy standing outside my door, and he had white hair. His white fox
ears perked, and he ran over to us. He quickly hugged Kakila and
kissed her cheek.</P><P>" What took you so
long mom, I've been waiting forever! " She smiled, and kissed
his forehead.</P><P>" Jaltia, " she
pointed at me, " this is Naruo, but Naru-san to you. Naruto, "
she pointed back at the boy, " this is Jaltia my son. We only
count for every thousand years, so he is almost one thousand years
old. " His fox tall shook from behind him, and her tail did the
same.</P><P>" It's nice to meet
you Naru-san, I've heard great things about you! " I smiled at
him, and he quickly hugged me.</P><P>" It's nice to meet
you too, so, what have you heard about me? " He pulled back and
looked up at me with great respect.</P><P>"
I heard that you killed thousands of humans in one swoop of your
claw, and while you were still in your fox form no less! I can't even
kill one human while I'm a fox, and that gains total respect in the
demon world! " I smiled at him, and he grins wildly.</P><P>"
Thank you, and I am very glad that I have such a nice reputation! "
Kyuubi grins as he once again begins to kiss my neck, and I tried not
to moan.</P><P>Jaltia
was staring at me as Kyuubi began to lick at my neck, and I tried to
control myself. " Kyuubi...not now...later. " I took
breathes inbetween my words as I tried to control my urges to moan
like there's no tomorrow.</P><P>"
Fine...but remember you said you would. " Kyuubi pouted as he
held onto my arms, and I laughed a little as I scratched the back of
my head.</P><P>"
So, what were your plans for today? " Kakila asked as her son
stood beside her, and I smiled evily.</P><P>"
What are you planning my little kitsune? " Kyuubi grinned with
me, and I began to walk into the village.</P><P>Everyone
followed me, and they still stared at me for a answer. I walked down
to the middle of town, and slowly crossed my legs and watched the
passerby's. They stared at me, but I then turned into my fox form.</P><P>"
Nar-san, what are you doing? " Jaltia asked as I grinned, and
Kyuubi sat next to me.</P><P>"
I think he wants to torture a few guilty souls, and you should be
greatfull to see him in action. " The fox smiled as he sat next
to me, and his mother did the same.</P><P>I
closed my eyes, and I could see their chakra as they passed by, and
their thoughts were crystal clear. I put my tail up, and it began to
glow.</P><P>"
What's Naru-san's tail doing Kyuubi-sensei? " Jaltia asked him
as my mind moved through the crowd.</P><P>"
It helps his chakra flow, and if you want, you can hold his tail to
see what he sees. " The boy stared in awe, and held his hand out
to my tail.</P><P>I
moved my tail over to him, and it shocked him at first. I felt him
lightly grabbing a hold of my tail, and his eyes closed as he saw
what I saw.</P><P>"
Wow, that's amazing Naru-san! " I chuckled a little, and I then
looked through someone's soul who's chakra and postion looked
suspicious.</P><P>'
I have to find her, and keep her away from that demon. Where did he
go? ' The man looked around and noticed me.</P><P>He
quickly ran off, and I gave chase. I could feel Kyuubi's, Jaltia, and
Kakila turned back into their fox forms as
they followed right behind me.</P>
