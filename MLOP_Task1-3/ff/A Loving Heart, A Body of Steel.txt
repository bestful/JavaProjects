This is renegadeofficer89, and this is my first attempt ever at writing fanfiction! I hope that my fic will be liked by a lot of people, and make sure that you review this fic of mine, and hopefully I can write this well enough for everyone to enjoy! An early warning though, due to massive amounts of work and low amounts of free time, updates may be sporadic and random, especially because I am literally flying by the seat of my pants here with this fic. And so, without further ado, this is the prologue chapter of A Loving Mind, A Body of Steel!</P><P>-STORY START-</P><P>At a distant land, a long, long time ago, on a land that would, in the future, be called the Elemental Nations, two beings of godly power, one a man who will later be called the God of Shinobi, the person who utilises chakra to its finest, the first and true wielder of the Rinnegan, and the greatest seal master in history, the Sage of Six Paths, the Rikudo Sennin, while the other, a being of pure power, maliciousness and hate, said to use all the evil in the world to be the source of its power, hell bent on destruction and death, the Juubi, is fighting, one to save the world, and the other to destroy it. And what a fight it was! Mountains torn asunder and recreated, seas would rise and fall at these twos' command, islands sank and rises, rivers dries and recreated, pure power flying around like flies around shit, and the population are avoiding the area, hell bent on not getting caught in the fight between two gods.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>After days upon days of fighting, sustained on nothing but nature chakra and his own chakra, the Sage has finally managed to subdue the deadly beast with his skills, and is going to seal it within himself, making him the first Jinchuuriki of a Bijuu, and the most powerful of them all, the Juubi. And during the process of sealing the beast within himself, the Juubi thrashed, resisted, and fought with all of its weakened might, but it all fails in front of the sealing prowess of the Sage. And within its death throes, the Juubi screams, with all its hate and rage.</P><P>"CURSE YOU, RIKUDO! CURSE YOU AND ALL YOUR DESCENDANTS! MAY THEY WILL ALL KNOW RAGE, ANGER AND FURY! MAY THEY KNOW VENGEANCE! AND THEY SHALL NEVER KNOW PEACE, NOT WHILE THEY STILL LIVE! AND WHEN I CAME BACK, I WILL CRUSH THEM AND FEAST UPON THEIR SOULS!"</P><P>"Such a thing will not happen, Juubi. I will seal you within myself and seal your body in an unreachable place, forever stuck in limbo." So the Sage speaks, while continuing the sealing calmly.</P><P>"CURSE YOU! YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HOLD MY POWER FOR LONG, MORTAL! A HUMAN YOU ARE, AND ALL HUMAN SHALL DIE! AND I SHALL BE FREE!"</P><P>"It's true that I will die. That is an undeniable fact. But I will do everything I can to make sure you will no longer be able to harm the world no more. NO MORE!"</P><P>"CURSE YOU! CURSE YOOOOOOOOOOooooooooouuuuuuuu !"</P><P>And thus the Juubi's power is sealed within the Sage himself and the body within the moon, he faints right after the sealing, and is in a coma for an entire week due to the sheer strength and willpower needed to seal the Juubi. In the years that follows, the Sage travelled the world, spreading his teachings on the use of chakra and shows his jutsus to the people, so much so that some people considers him a god, which he denies with all his heart.</P><P>But alas, the power of the Juubi is too powerful to be contained, and it starts damaging him from the inside. After a couple of years, he decided to do something that he thought would help prevent the Juubi from waking up, forever. He splits the power into nine parts using his jutsu, Nija Arts: Creation of All Things, each part getting a certain trait of the Juubi and a certain number of tails, which represents their power, with one being the weakest and nine being the strongest. He treats the nine new Bijuus with love, like he would treat his two sons. But sadly, it is too late, and the Sage's body is too damaged to heal, even with all his godly powers. After a couple more years, he is on his deathbed, and has sent his will to his sons, one of which will create the Senju clan, and the other will create the Uchiha clan, both which will later be known for their prowess in the Ninja arts. After his sons left, he speaks to the nine Bijuus, which he considers his sons and daughters as well.</P><P>"All of you, Shukaku, Matatabi, Isobu, Son Goku, Kokuo, Saiken, Choumei, Gyuuki and Kurumi, each of you, a part of the Juubi that I split. Here is something that I haven't told all of you yet. During the splitting, I also split parts of my soul to create all of you, giving you sentience and a thinking mind. Also, the part of my soul within you has a part of my Creation of All Things jutsu that will activate itself after a certain situation. This part of me will activate the Creation of All Things and will change you into a half demon, one whose powers still remains, but changes you into a human."</P><P>"But father, why would you do that to us? A human cannot live forever, and thus we might release the power of the Juubi back to him!" Asked Gyuuki.</P><P>"That is true. However, the reason why the jutsu will activate is only and only if you managed to gain a mate worthy of the love of a Bijuu. Remember, my children, that even though all of you are a part of a great, evil being, love will be able to suppress the vile powers of the Juubi that you all contain. The jutsu will only activate if you found a human worthy as a mate and if you give all your powers to him or her, thus making you powerless, though your power will recover to its original level in time. This will cause the Juubi's vile power be neutralised, and destroys him entirely. It will also turn your chosen mates into a half demon as well, and as long as you didn't get decapitated, you will live forever, with your children inheriting the traits of the half demon that you and your mate will become."</P><P>"But father, why a human? Can we not choose what creature that we will choose to be our mate?" asked Kurumi next.</P><P>"A human is special. Only a human is capable of loving other creature than them, though at the same time, only humans can have such hatred towards a non-human being. With half demons of all of you walking around later on the Earth, they will accept all of you into their lives, though the journey for that will be a hard and rough one. The Creation of All Things will also create a seal that marks your chosen mate and binds his or her soul with yours, so if one of you were to die, the other will follow, which is the ultimate act of love. Also, due to this binding, you and your mate will never be affected by any genjutsu, for the other soul will immediately recover the other. Remember my children, only love, pure love, can neutralise the power of the Juubi that you all contain. Remember this, and you shall not be consumed by the evilness of the Juubi's power that you contain. Each of you have parts of the Juubi's power, Shukaku the ability to control sand and earth, Matatabi the power to summon cleansing flames and the dead, Isobu the control over water and a hard shell, Son Goku the ability to create lava out of nothing, Kokuo the power of steam, Saiken the skill to use offensive and defensive bubbles, Choumei the hard skin of the Juubi which manifests as a shell and the ability to fly, and Gyuuki the brute strength and the multiple arms of the Juubi. When you and your chosen mate becomes a half demon, all these abilities and powers will be shared by you, your mate and any descendants that you may have."</P><P>"Father, what about me? You haven't mentioned the power that my part of the Juubi is." Asked Kurumi.</P><P>"Yours is the most special, my daughter. You contain not just the extreme healing abilities that the Juubi has, you also contain the power to change and modify the biological construct of you. This ability is what makes the Juubi so hard to defeat, since he can adapt to any attacks or jutsus that I use. Now my children, remember of love, remember of me and remember of the story of the Juubi. Though in the end, he is defeated, and his powers split into all of you. Now I will take my leave, and return to the Pure World, to be with my ancestors. Goodbye, and always remember that I loved all of you..."</P><P>"Father? Father? Don't leave yet! FATHEEEEEEEEEEERR!" screams Shukaku while shaking the lifeless body of the Sage. The other bijuu then looks downwards, tears in their eyes.</P><P>And thus ends the life of the Saviour of The World, the Sage of the Six Paths. Afterwards, the descendants of the Sage travelled the world, spreading his teachings and the Bijuus as well, though each of them went their separate paths, never to meet again for hundreds of years, when Shinobi rises.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Hundreds of years had passed, and the teaching of the Sage had long since been forgotten, with the rise of the people called Shinobis. Instead of using the Sage's teaching for peace, they use it to wage war, kill, mutilate and destroy each other. During this time as well, the Bijuus, due to constantly being under attack by humans and not knowing whether the humans that they met are good or evil, starts being corrupted by the very power that they are supposed to hold back, and starts raging and destroying anything that they see, thus causing legends of their evilness. All except for Kurumi, who managed to retain her sanity and remembered the teachings of her father, and managed to hide herself in the mountains which will later be called The Land of iron.</P><P>After years upon years of non-stop wars, a group of Shinobis decided to create peace within their own ranks by creating the Ninja Villages, where a group of Shinobis all worked together in harmony, though they still waged wars among the villages. A ninja, known as Senju Hashirama, descendant of the second child of the Sage, decided to make peace with Uchiha Madara, descendant of the first child and decided to unite their clans under the banner of the Hidden Leaf Village, or Konohagakure no Sato. But then, due to Senju Hashirama being chosen as the Shodaime Hokage, Madara gets angry because he thinks that the Hokage position gets owned by the Senju means that he is pushed aside and has to take orders from the Senju. But, after proposing the idea of a coup with his clan, he was banished because the clan members thinks that he is too power hungry for his own good, and that they are tired of fighting and decided to make peace with the Senjus. Enraged, Madara decided to take things into his own hands, and will annihilate the Senjus from the earth and took the tile of Hokage for himself. For that, he needs power. The power in the form of a bijuu, the only bijuu hidden, the Nine Tails, Kurumi.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Kurumi was taking a nap at the mountains of Land of Iron when she was awakened by a loud explosion outside her lair. Feeling curious, she decided to peek outside her den, where her eyes met the crimson Sharingan of Madara, and she remembers no more.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>At a place that will later be called The Valley of the End, three people stood in front of each other, the Shodaime Hokage Senju Hashirama, his wife Uzumaki-Senju Mito and Uchiha Madara. An epic battle will commence, but first, Hashirama decided to question his rival on his actions.</P><P>"Madara! Why are you doing this?! The alliance between the Senju and the Uchiha is meant to make peace between our clans, not to further antagonize each other!"</P><P>"Shut up fool! Do you think I did not know of your plans? You will subvert my clan under your will, turning us into nothing but sacrificial lambs while you will grow, unstopped and unchecked! The Uchiha will then fall under the sheer weight of the Senju's strength, and we will be forgotten in the annals of history! I will stop you before that happens, even if my clan banished me!"</P><P>"No Madara, you are the fool! I did not choose to be the leader! It is by majority vote that I am picked as the leader, a vote which includes members of your clan!"</P><P>"Shut up! I will not hear more of this farce! I will end you and your wife, and make Konoha mine!"</P><P>"*sighs* Then fight we shall, Madara. I will not hold back just because you are my rival! Prepare yourself!"</P><P>The battle between the two are an amazing affair, with the Shodaime's Wood Release trees flying and crushing everything that Madara throws at him, and Madara's Susanoo, gained from having the Eternal Mangekyo Sharingan by taking the eyes of his brother, Izuna, destroys everything that the Shodaime threw at him. The battle creates valleys, destroys mountains and crushes everything that is stuck between the two. The battle was at a stalemate, when Madara decides to unleash his trump card, the Kyuubi.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>"You are a great fighter and warrior as always Hashirama. But this is the end! This is my trump card to defeat you! Summoning Jutsu : Kyuubi!"</P><P>In a massive puff of smoke, Kurumi, now known as the Kyuubi, appeared in front of the two warriors with a massive roar and immediately attacked Hashirama, who is now forced to fight a two way battle with a force of nature at one side and Uchiha Madara at another. But then, using his Wood Release skills, he managed to wrap the Kyuubi in a giant pile of wooden prison which absorbs her chakra.</P><P>"My love! Concentrate on figting Madara! I will seal the Kyuubi within myself!"</P><P>"But the Kyuubi is a very powerful creature! You will not last!"</P><P>"Have you forgotten that we of the Uzumaki Clan are masters of sealing? I will be fine! Just go!"</P><P>"...Thank you my love. Madara! I shall defeat you today!"</P><P>"Do your worst, Senju scum!"</P><P>And so, the Kyuubi is then sealed into Mito, while Madara, who have used a lot of chakra to summon Kyuubi, was defeated. And peace continues afterwards with Senju Hashirama as the Shodaime Hokage, who then uses his Wood Release to capture all the Bijuu and gives them to other villages as a symbol of peace and power balance, with Iwa getting the Gobi and the Yonbi, Kiri getting the Sanbi and the Rokubi, Taki getting the Nanabi, Suna getting the Ichibi, and Kumo getting the Hachibi and the Nibi. But this is not the end, for a new story begins now for Kurumi...</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>"<I>...What?What just happened? Where am I?</I>"</P><P>Kurumi wakes up, and sees that she is chained within a white space, with her snout muzzled, her arms, legs and tails stabbed with huge iron spikes. She tries to wriggle out of the muzzle and spikes, but it seems impossible.</P><P>"What is this?! I am trapped! How am I trapped here? The last thing I saw is a red eye with spinning tomoes, then I knew no more..."</P><P>"This is your seal Kyuubi, and I am your jailor or a jinchuuriki, Uzumaki Mito."</P><P>A figure with crimson hair and a lithe body wearing a kimono with her hair in buns which has talismans hanging from them appeared in front of Kurumi.</P><P>"WHAT?! I AM SEALED?! HOW CAN THAT BE?! I LIVED AWAY FROM HUMANS IN A SECRET LAIR! HOW CAN I BE SEALED?!"</P><P>"You are summoned by an enemy of my husband, Senju Hashirama during a battle between the two of them. You immediately attacked my husband and tried to kill him, so he subdued you using his Mokuton and I sealed you within myself."</P><P>"What? I do not remember taking part in any battle nor war, and I still remember father's teachings. There is no way I will be involved in a battle between humans."</P><P>"If you do not believe me, I will show you the proof. I will show you my memories of the battle, and you will see your actions which causes you to be sealed."</P><P>A jumble of memories from Mito then assaulted the mind of Kurumi, and she sees her actions, her rage, her anger, and her power being used against Hashirama.</P><P>"...What? But I don't understand. I have no recollection of these events, and as a bijuu, I cannot forget whatever events that happened. I do not remember being summoned, attacking you and your husband, and everything that happens in that memory."</P><P>"What is the last memory that you remembered then? Care to share, in case we can make some sense of it?"</P><P>"My last memory is that I was peacefully sleeping in my den at the mountains, before an explosion interrupted my sleep. I went outside to see what happened, then I looked into a strange eye, a red eye with three spinning tomoes around a pupil. The next thing I remember is waking up with these spikes and muzzle on me."</P><P>"That sounds like the Sharingan, a dojutsu that can cast powerful illusions or genjutsus to a target. From what I can say of it, it seems like Madara controlled you with the Sharingan and forced yeou to attack us."</P><P>"From what I can see in your memories, that would be the most logical explanation. But controlled? The only one that can do so is father, and he never did that. Maybe his descendants can? Damn. If being controlled like that makes me lost in rage, I'd rather not be controlled anymore."</P><P>"This father you kept talking about, who is he? From the way you speak of him, you respected him a lot. Care to share the story with me?"</P><P>"Of course! Father is also known as the Sage of Six Paths..."</P><P>And thus Kurumi told Lady Mito about her existence, the Sage, the Juubi, and all the history of the Sage.</P><P>"...And now we end up here. Can you at least remove the muzzle?"</P><P>"You are definitely a wise, great and honourable creature, Kurumi-san. I will do more for you than that. I will remove all the locks on you, but I will keep you sealed within me, to prevent you from being controlled again, and getting lost in the throes of the Juubi's rage again."</P><P>And with just a thought, the muzzle and bars around Kurumi disappeared, and she then massaged her hurting tails, arms and snout.</P><P>"You know, you didn't have to use a seal that stabs me like that. It hurts."</P><P>"I apologise, but the nature of the seal makes the restraints appear as such. Anyway, why are you fine with being sealed within me?"</P><P>"As I said earlier, my powers all came from the Juubi, whose destructive rage can destroy anything. And nowadays, I can still control myself from succumbing to the same rage by remembering father's teachings. Being controlled like that loses me of my willpower, thus makes me lose myself in rage and destructive tendencies. Humans continuously attacking us also cause us to lose ourself in the same rage, which causes us to destroy everything around us, though I managed to escape such fate by isolating myself from the rest of the world and hide myself in the mountains. I guess that it is not enough, seeing that I still got sealed within you, Mito. In order to prevent myself from being used as a tool again, I would rather be sealed within you, seeing that I cannot be affected by any jutsu in here."</P><P>"Oh. I guess that is a rather interesting thought. You are welcome to make your home in my mind, Kurumi-san. But, what's that about a mate that you said before?"</P><P>"<I>Crap! I shouldn't say anything about that! But I guess that she wants to help me, so I think that she deserves to know."</I></P><P>And thus Kurumi tells the Uzumaki about the bijuus and their mates. After listening to the tale, Mito sat on the white floor, and thinks for a while, and then spoke to Kurumi.</P><P>"Kurumi-san, let me make you a deal. Any of my descendants, if they're male, will have you sealed within them, carrying and protecting you as a legacy of the Uzumaki. And if any of them are worthy as your mate, according to you, take them as your mate, and let them rid you of the hate that you carry. And to further strengthen the bond between you and your future mate, we will teach you everything that we know about the ninja arts, so that you will be able to teach both your future mate and your children. How is that?"</P><P>"<I>Hmmm... that isn't too bad an offer, and I will still be the one to pick my mate, not that I have one yet, and from what I can see, the Uzumaki and the Senju are both a very honourable person, and the Senju has father's aura. I think that it is a pretty good offer, a good one too."</I></P><P>"Before I accept your offer, can I meet your husband, the one responsible for the capture of my siblings?"</P><P>"Of course, Kurumi-san. I will bring him here into my mindscape."</P><P>After a couple of minutes of Mito leaving, a second figure appeared in front of Kurumi, the figure of Senju Hashirama.</P><P>"Oh. So this is where the Kyuubi is sealed in. And you are Kurumi-san, Mito has explained to me... What are you doing?"</P><P>While Hashirama was speaking, the bijuu came closer to him and sniffed him, for no apparent reason.</P><P>"You have father's scent on you, though it is weak, extremely so. That probably means that you are related to him, somehow."</P><P>"Well, that's new. So, as I said earlier, Mito has explained to me about you and the bijuus, and we are honoured to be the family that will help you rid yourself of the taint of the Juubi. And an Uzumaki will never go back on their word. We will also keep this a secret among us, to prevent others from abusing the notion of said power."</P><P>"Since you are related to father, I feel that you can be trusted. Very well, this is an offer that I will accept."</P><P>Thus begins the life of Mito and Hashirama, together with the bijuu sealed within Mito, who is taught in all that they know about the ninja arts, and due to a bijuu's photographic memory, even though she herself cannot use it, she still remembers the teachings of Mito and Hashirama, while merging them with the Sage's teachings. After a few years, Mito gave birth to a girl, which will later give birth to another who will be known in the future as Senju Tsunade of the Sannin. After the birth of her daughter, the First Shinobi World War started, and Hashirama, even with all his skill as a ninja, died in front of a massive army, and the mantle of Hokage taken up by his brother, Senju Tobirama as the Nidaime Hokage, and Sarutobi Hiruzen as the Sandaime after Tobirama's death. Mito, who never remarried after the death of Hashirama has chosen her niece from Uzushiogakure, Uzumaki Kushina to be the next host for Kurumi when her age has caught up with her. Kushina, also known as the Whirlpool Princess due to her relation with Uzushio's daimyo, carries Kurumi with pride, and is also taught the same story and the deal made with Kurumi by Mito, and promises to continue the deal. Not long afterwards, Uzushiogakure is destroyed by a coalition of Kumo-Kiri-Iwa, which weakens the coalition so much that they are defeated by Konoha afterwards as revenge for destroying one of Konoha's most powerful allies during the Second Shinobi World War.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>A couple years passed, and after a series of events, Kushina fell in love with the future Yondaime Hokage, Namikaze Minato, who devastated an entire battalion of Iwa shinobi during the Third Shinobi World War using only two jutsus, the Hiraishin and the Rasengan, and earned himself an SS-rank with a flee on sight order in the bingo book. They got married in secret shortly after the war, and not long after that Kushina is pregnant with a child, this time, a boy.</P><P>"Kurumi! I am having a boy! Maybe this boy can be your future mate?"</P><P>"I don't see why not. I can feel the power that the boy contains, and I'd have to say that this boy will be a strong child, and maybe the Toad's prophecy will be inherited by him."</P><P>"That is true, Kurumi. Now all we have to do is wait until I gave birth to him, to Naruto."</P><P>"You still decided to use that old pervert's book's main character's name as his name?"</P><P>"What? I don't think it's a bad name. It fits with us Uzumaki as well."</P><P>"Well, it's your choice. I will not bother you with this petty argument no more."</P><P>And so, nine months later, Kushina is ready to give birth to her first, and unknowingly to her, her only child...</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>"AAAAAARGH! MINATO! I WILL KILL YOU AFTER THIS! THIS IS YOUR FAULT FOR GETTING ME PREGNANT! AAARGH!"</P><P>"Don't worry Kushina! The baby's almost out! Keep pushing!"</P><P>Minato's hand is probably being broken at five different places, such is the strength of Kushina's grip on his hand. Yet, he did not even wince, his excitement to be a father acts like the ultimate painkiller for his hand. In a cave outside of Konoha, a platoon of ANBU guards is guarding the place where Kushina is giving birth, for they feared that people would sense the demonic chakra flaring out of her, considering that the seal weakens the most during the process of giving birth. Kurumi is doing her best to not damage the seal even more while reigning in her demonic chakra and help dull the pain that Kushina is going through. Minato is also doing his best to reinforce the weakening seal while having his hand crushed by Kushina's grip.</P><P>The cry of a baby then broke through the screams of pain that Kushina is screaming out, a sign that the baby has safely been delivered. A boy, with small tufts of blonde hair and with the deepest sky blue colour in his eyes is then handed over to Kushina, with Minato watching close by. But, just as Minato is about to hold the baby, an arm appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the baby, before killing Biwako Sarutobi, the medic that handled Kushina's delivery and also the Sandaime's wife and Tsunade's teacher. Minato immediately took out one of his Hiraishin kunais and held it in a defensive position.</P><P>"Who are you?! What do you want with my son?!"</P><P>The man, a person with a spiral mask on his face, then laughs.</P><P>"Your son? Well, then you can have him!"</P><P>He then tossed little Naruto away, while laughing at Minato, who immediately Hiraishined to Naruto's position, before realising that the blanket covering Naruto is filled with exploding tags. He then teleported Naruto to a small shack outside Konoha while leaving the exploding tags exploding without any effect. Meanwhile, the man reached out to Kushina's seal, laughing all the way.</P><P>"What do you want with me?!"</P><P>"Oh no, Kushina. I want nothing to do with you. The thing that I want is within you, not you."</P><P>"You wanted the Kyuubi! But why?"</P><P>"It's because I wanted to see my ultimate ambition! I wanted to see Konoha burn to the ground!"</P><P>Then, crimson, blood red chakra started pouring out of Kushina's seal and started to form a fox's head on top of Kushina. The head then tried to struggle, but it accidentally looked into the swirling Sharingan eye of the man, and it stopped struggling.</P><P>"Kurumi! Remember the teachings! Remember what your father said to you!"</P><P>"*chuckles*It's too late. She is now under my control. And my order to you : destroy Konoha!"</P><P>Kurumi then roared and is absorbed into the man's Sharingan eye, and the man then disappears as well, leaving Kushina to die. Sadly, he underestimated an Uzumaki's vitality, since even though severely weakened, Kushina is still very much alive. Minato then flashed to her location, and applied first aid to her, before promising to check back later. He then flashed to the man's location.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>It is a peaceful day in Konoha, when all of a sudden, a man appeared above Konoha and summoned the Kyuubi, which started rampaging across Konoha, destroying homes, shops and killing people. The sheer vileness of its chakra froze many a man, some outright had heart attacks due to sheer overwhelming fear. Ninjas fought valiantly to stop her, jutsus are thrown, weapons are launched, yet nothing stopped her. Both ninjas and civilians died by the dozens, killed by a swipe of a tail, or stomped to oblivion, or being eaten by Kyuubi. And then, everybody saw that Kyuubi is charging up a huge ball of chakra, a Bijuudama and aimed it at Konoha. But at the last minute, the silhouette of the Yondaime appeared in front of Kyuubi right before the bijuudama is launched, after which the launched bijuudama is absorbed into a sealing barrier and is diverted to the outskirts of Konoha. He then bit his thumb before running through a series of handseals to summon Gamabunta, the Chief Toad.</P><P>"Minato! What is the meaning of this? I am not strong enough to fight against a bijuu, especially the Kyuubi! She's called the strongest bijuu for a reason you know!"</P><P>"I know that boss. I just wanted you to stall her for a couple of minutes while I deal with the person who summoned her here and to prepare a method to seal her into Naruto!"</P><P>"I cannot buy you too much time! She is too powerful even for me!"</P><P>"Don't worry Bunta! Just do your best!"</P><P>Gamabunta then drew his tanto out of its sheathe and started to hop closer to the Kyuubi, preparing to subdue her. Meanwhile, Minato fights against the masked man that attacked Kushina and managed to rout his attacks and forces him to flee. He then grabs Kushina and Naruto and starts to draw massive symbols on naruto's stomach before they started arguing.</P><P>"We must seal her into Naruto! We have no other choice!"</P><P>"No Minato! There is always another choice! You can reseal her into me!"</P><P>"But you are weak right now! There is no way for you to handle the stress of the resealing! If you die, then she will be vulnerable again!"</P><P>But before they can continue their argument, one of Kyuubi's claws tried to kill little Naruto, and only managed to pierce both Minato and Kushina who protected Naruto with their lives. The Kyuubi is then restrained with Kushina's chakra chains that she created with the last of her strength.</P><P>"I guess... there is... no other choice... we must seal her... into Naruto..."</P><P>"Yes... I'm sorry Minato... for fighting with you... let me say my last words to Naruto before you seal her within him with the Shiki Fuujin..."</P><P>"Naruto... there is so much I want to say to you... but our time here is short... always remember... to eat your veggies... and to listen to Kurumi... and train often... be a strong person... and do not fall into hatred... you are destined to be the saviour of the world... be strong... find a nice girl... Kurumi is a very nice girl... I'm sure she will like you as well..."</P><P>"Naruto... this is your father... I second everything your mom said... forgive me for placing this burden on you, but... we have no choice... may you forgive us in the afterlife... now I'll end this! Fuuinjutsu: Shiki Fuujin!"</P><P>The spectre of Shinigami appeared behind Minato as an arm went through his body and grabbed the restrained Kyuubi and pushes her into the Hakke no Fuuin Shiki on Naruto's stomach, and sacrifices his soul as payment.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p>Hello everyone! This is renegadeofficer89 with the first chapter of A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel, came faster than my warning at the first chapter said thanks to my fever, diarrhoea, dizziness, and a whole host of other crappy illness! At least it brought forward something good for you all. This chapter will also show why I rate this story an M rating, and why is the title of the story so. So, without further ado, I bring to you the first chapter!</p><p>EDIT: Added a new organ in the bloodline.</p><p>Disclaimer from now until the end of the story: I do not own Naruto, Warhammer 40,000 and Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha, which is the property of Masashi Kishimoto, Games Workshop and Seven Arcs Studios respectively.</p><p>Chapter 1: Loving Heart, Body of Steel</p><p>-STORY START-</p><p>In a very peaceful morning in Konoha, a blonde boy with sky blue eyes, six whisker marks on his cheeks wearing an orange shirt with the Uzumaki spiral at the back and a pair of black short pants is walking at a street towards a training area. Uzumaki Naruto, the boy we are talking about had a megawatt smile on his face. He is extremely excited today! He is four years old by now, and Kurumi-chan says that he can start his training in the ninja arts beginning today, with her as his teacher! He still remembered how he met with Kurumi-chan the first time...</p><p>*FLASHBACK*</p><p>Right after the sealing, Kurumi woke up and saw that she is caged behind huge golden bars that reached the heavens with inky black darkness surrounding her with fetid waters at her feet. After she saw her situation and remembered what happened, she started crying, her tears flowing freely into the waters beneath her.</p><p>"<b>Kushina...Minato...I can't believe I got controlled again... by the same eyes nonetheless...I never thought that the same thing will happen again...Now I am sealed within their son...Forgive me Kushina, Minato..."</b></p><p>While Kurumi is busy wallowing in self despair, at the outside, little Naruto, just two hours old by this time, already had three assassination attempts on him stopped by the Sandaime and an ANBU with silver gravity defying hair and a dog mask. This is Hatake Kakashi, one of the most loyal and best ANBU in Konoha's service who have been tasked with guarding Naruto, and is currently in the process of subduing another ninja who decided that the 'Demon Child' should die for attacking Konoha. Kakashi, who by this time has gotten bored of listening to these ninjas screaming crap about why and how Naruto must die, instantly knocks out the attacking nin and tied his hands and legs in a manner that he will be unable to use any jutsus. At the same time, the Sandaime, who just came back from a council meeting about what to do with Naruto, entered the room.</p><p>"Kakashi! Report!"</p><p>"Sandaime-sama... these four ninjas has decided that they'll take justice into their own hands and tries to attack Naruto. I subdued all of them with knockout strikes and tied them up, so that Ibiki can... play with them later." Kakashi said in his usual bored manner.</p><p>The Sandaime then sighs and sat at a nearby chair. Kakashi, ever the astute ninja, saw this act and started to ask Sandaime about what happened in the council room.</p><p>"Kakashi, everything is a mess right now. All the civilian side of the council wanted him to be executed, any adoption attempts for him has been blocked, and I just managed to prevent Danzo from taking him to create an emotionless weapon. I don't even know whether or not I can keep the promise that I made to Minato before his death. This has been a very long day, and I fear that Naruto's hardship has just begun."</p><p>"Then what will happen to him Hokage-sama? Where will you place him then?"</p><p>"I planned to place him in an orphanage, where his true identity as the last and only heir of the Namikaze-Uzumaki clan will be hidden from everyone, and give him only the surname of his mother, Uzumaki, so that he does not draw the ire of Iwa and Kumo. Minato's enemies are plenty, and it's our job to prevent them from finding out Naruto's existence."</p><p>"If so, then I would like to ask for a permanent position as his guard, Hokage-sama."</p><p>"Denied. Kakashi, you are one of, if not the, best ANBU that Konoha has. And even if we had just been attacked by a bijuu, we still have missions to do, and you are one of our best. I can place you as his guard when we are out of high ranking missions to do."</p><p>"...I understand. I thank you, Hokage-sama for the chance to repay back Minato-sensei. I will not let all three of you, Hokage-sama, Naruto and Minato-sensei down."</p><p>After this talk, Kakashi and Sandaime placed Naruto at an orphanage, which is even now, overflowing with orphans due to Kyuubi's attack. The matron who receives Naruto accepts him with a smile at first, but once the two left, she looks at Naruto with scorn, and Naruto's first two years of hell starts. During his first two years, he ended up being abused in various ways. They prevented him from eating sometimes, causing him to become as thin as a plank and his development stunted. He was constantly bullied by the kids in the orphanage, some even gets sweets and treats for doing so. The matron neglected to even teach him how to speak and read properly, though this is where Naruto's brilliance shone through. He managed to learn to speak just by listening to the people around him, though to read is a lot harder, since the orphanage denied him access to books, thus, his reading skills are below par for someone of his age.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>One night, during his second year there, when he was sleeping, he ended up in a sewer-like place, with ankle high waters, pipes at the walls and some torches that shows him the way. Being a smart, curious kid that he is, he walks around the winding sewer, following nothing but his instincts that told him to go in which direction. After some time, he reached an open area where even the walls and ceiling disappeared, only to be replaced with a huge expanse of darkness. Following his heart, he kept walking, and reached a place where there are huge bars that reached the skies that looks like a prison, with a single paper with the kanji for 'seal' on it. Then, Naruto heard the sound of someone crying and decided to call the person inside.</p><p>"'Ello? Oo'z dere? (AN: he is still two years old and they cannot speak too well)" Naruto screams into the darkness.</p><p>After a while, the sounds of huge footsteps are heard, and the largest being that Naruto had ever seen appeared in front of him. A huge, red coloured fox, bigger than even the mountain with faces on it, with nine tails and human-like arms with opposable thumbs appeared, causing Naruto to gape in awe at it. Then the fox starts to speak, and Naruto's jaws fell on the ground.</p><p>"<b>*sniff* Naruto... You have come... I guess I can still pull you into your mindscape to talk, hard as it is..."</b></p><p>"Fox! 'Uge fox! Red 'uge fox!"</p><p>"<i><b>Oh Naruto... You really are still a child... the people around you didn't even teach you to speak well... Then I shall be your teacher, your partner, your friend, your advisor and your lover... But first, let's correct your speech first."</b></i></p><p>"<b>Not 'uge. Huge. H-U-G-E."</b></p><p>"Huge...?"</p><p>"<b>Yes. Correct. And I am a fox. And this is your mindscape Naruto."</b></p><p>"'ind...?"</p><p>"<b>This is going to take a while. Sit down Naruto. I will teach you how to speak properly."</b></p><p>And so meets Naruto and Kurumi for the first time. She taught Naruto how to speak, how to read, how to write, numbers and even during the early years Naruto's brilliance shone through, picking up words and speech easily, and after a short while, he managed to gain proper speech capability and is able to write and read well. But sadly, he is still being abused, even more so that his speaking and reading skills suddenly became better even without anyone visibly teaching him. Getting fed up of his treatment at the orphanage, Kurumi decided, one day, to tell Naruto the truth when he was three.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Naruto is currently wearing the rags that he calls clothes and is sitting in front of Kurumi's cage and is preparing himself to continue learning from her when she decides to do something different for this session.</p><p>"<b>Naruto, have you seen how the people around you treats you? How they always bullied you, how they hated you, how they looked to you with scorn?"</b></p><p>"Scorn? Oh! New word! What does it mean Kurumi-chan?"</p><p>"<b>*chuckles* Scorn means hatred, Naruto. Your capacity to learn and absorb whatever knowledge you encountered never ceases to amaze me."</b></p><p>"Yeah, I've seen the looks that they gave me, though I don't know why they did so. I mean, I didn't do anything to them, yet they looked at me like I killed their dog or something."</p><p>"<b>Naruto, I think it is time that you learned what happened during your birth, and the events that happened even long before you were born..."</b></p><p>And so Kurumi started telling Naruto about what happened when he was born, the fight, his kidnapping, her being controlled and later sealed, the story of her life with Mito, within his mother, the deal with Mito, her birth, everything. During the telling of the story, Naruto stops her multiple times to ask about all the new words that he heard Kurumi said. At the end of the story, both Kurumi and Naruto is in tears, but for two different reasons, one due to the potential hatred that she will receive, and the other for knowing of why everyone hates him so.</p><p>"<b>Naruto, I understand if you decide to hate me after this. I mean, I killed your parents, caused you to be hated by the entire village, and gets you assassination attempts almost daily when you were younger. So I will no longer be able to teach you—"</b></p><p>"What? NO! No! I will never hate you! It is not your fault all that happened! You are controlled by someone! It is not your fault! In fact, I won't mind if the villagers hate me! I will take that hatred in your place, Kurumi-chan! If you think that you cannot stand the hatred of the people, of the human around you, the scorn (hey, new word usage!, Naruto thought) of the village, then let me bear them for you! Let me take their hatred, and change it to love! They will not break me, and they will not break you as well! I will change their mind later on, when I'm bigger, so for now I will hold you on the promise you made with Mito-baa-san, and show the world that the willpower of an Uzumaki is infinite!" Naruto screams to Kurumi when he heard her say such blasphemous things.</p><p>"<i><b>What a person he is! He did not even think twice about accepting the hatred of the people around him, and even will take in my hatred as well! His heart is the purest that I have ever felt in the years that I have lived! Father, I have found my future mate! We will show the world that hatred can be cleansed!"</b></i></p><p>"<b>Naruto... I thank you. You are a really strong child, and it really shows. I will be with you every step of the way, and don't you dare think that you'll face this pain alone."</b></p><p>Naruto then flashed his million watt smile that can light up even the darkest of days to Kurumi, and restarts his learning time after Kurumi's story. Over the days that passed, Naruto shows more determination than was ever thought possible, facing the abuse that he receives daily without so much even flinching or crying, because he understood that hatred cannot be fought back with hatred, even at his small age. Weeks later, Naruto remembered something about his parents that he wants to ask Kurumi about. Nowadays, he can enter his mindscape at will, not requiring Kurumi to pull him inside. He walks back to the cage that contains Kurumi and decided to ask her the question that will change his life.</p><p>"Kurumi-chan, you said that my parents are ninjas right? Can you teach me the ways of the ninja?"</p><p>"<b>Naruto, I will be glad to do so. But right now, you are too small </b>(Naruto pouts at hearing this, his height is a sensitive matter for him)<b> and your body is not developed enough to learn all the things that I have to teach you. We can start your ninja training when you've reached four years old. For now, I will teach you sealing theory first, so that you can start using seals when you have unlocked your chakra later. Now you must remember, sealing is a mostly lost art, and is very complicated..."</b></p><p>And so Kurumi starts Naruto's lessons on sealing theories, teaching him of the subtle arts of sealing. As one with Uzumaki blood, Naruto learned seals extremely fast, even surprising Kurumi herself with the speed at which he learns seals.</p><p>*FLASHBACK ENDS*</p><p>Naruto is going along the street in the morning of his birthday towards a training ground after slipping away from the orphanage when some of the villagers saw him.</p><p>"Hey look! It's the demon brat!"</p><p>"Yeah! What is he doing here?"</p><p>"The Hokage must've been crazy to leave him alive!"</p><p>"Hey, I have an idea! What about we..."</p><p>The three villagers started whispering among themselves before going their separate ways. Unfortunately for Naruto, these people are actually going to meet with their friends, who will gather their friends to form a mob that will try to finish the 'Demon Brat' once and for all...</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Naruto was having a very bad day. During his walk, he suddenly saw a mob holding pitchforks and torches heading his way. His sensitive hearing picked up that they wanted to 'kill the Demon Brat', or so they said. He immediately turned and ran away, which sadly attracted the mob's sight towards his location, after which they immediately chased him. Naruto ran as fast as his tiny, malnourished four year old legs can carry him, which, for all intents and purpose, not that fast. He then turned into an alley between the shop lots, which sadly for him, ends up with a dead end. But Naruto, ever the strong willed, turned and faced the mob bravely, all while hearing the screams of the mob members.</p><p>"You killed my daughter!"</p><p>"You destroyed my home! And killed my husband!"</p><p>"We will finish what the Yondaime started!"</p><p>"Yeah! Kill the demon!"</p><p>Hearing all this, Naruto remembered the promise that he made to Kurumi about him taking the villagers' hate on him, and decided, against all manner of logic, to turn around, and screamed to the mob.</p><p>"If you guys wanted to hate me then do so! Come at me, and show me your hate! Hold nothing back!"</p><p>"We won't hold anything back, you demon! Prepare to die!" shouted a member of the mob while charging straight towards a standing Naruto. But Naruto, decided that antagonizing the mob is a bad idea, dodged the guy before running straight towards the other member of the mob, hoping to escape by slipping between their legs. Unfortunately, one of them took that chance to send a powerful kick towards his small body, sending him flying towards a wall, impacting it with a loud crunch.</p><p>"Let's show the demon what pain is!" cried the first man again while coming at Naruto with a butcher knife in hand. Naruto, still dazed due to the impact on the wall, is unable to do anything to prevent the guy from slashing his arms, creating massive, deep wounds on them.</p><p>"We will not let you die easily! Feel the pain of everyone whose lives you destroyed in that attack!"</p><p>He then systematically started to cut Naruto's arms and chest, leaving massive lacerations, before another person decides to say "Fuck all this waiting" and stabbed Naruto with a kitchen knife on his shoulder. Another decides to stomp on his legs, breaking them until the bones are exposed, and kicked him again and again. They all take turns to torture him with multiple equipments, from almost being gutted with a pitchfork and his forehead carved with the word 'demon' using a kunai. All the while, his earlier wounds are already healing due to the healing powers of Kurumi, while she is screaming in his head.</p><p>"<b>WHY? WHY? DO YOU NOT SEE THAT HE IS JUST A CHILD? HE IS NOT ME, NOT IN ANY WAY! STOP DOING THIS! STOP IT! PLEASE STOP!"</b></p><p>"Kurumi-chan...Just let them. If this is the price to pay to take the hatred of the villagers on me, then I will gladly pay it. We cannot repay hatred with hatred, it creates a never ending cycle of hatred..."</p><p>"<b>BUT LOOK AT THEM! THEY ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU IN THE WORST WAY POSSIBLE! LOOK! THAT GUY JUST STABBED YOUR EYE WITH A FORK! I CANNOT HEAL THIS MUCH DAMAGE WITHOUT BREAKING THE SEAL!"</b></p><p>"Look everyone! His wounds have already healed! There is no way a human can heal that fast! Let's finish him!"</p><p>Amidst the cheers of the mob, a ninja came by, started doing some handsigns before launching a Katon: Great Fireball towards a now bloodied Naruto who have also been drenched with kerosene before, turning him from a pile of broken bones and tortured meat into a raging bonfire. All the while, he is still being healed continuously, straining the seal, so much so that even his eye has healed, and even in the fire he is healing. Suddenly, in the middle of the mob, a huge killing intent (KI) appeared, before the crowd parted to show the face of the Sandaime in a furious snarl. In a snap of his finger a group of ANBUs came out of nowhere and started herding the mob to him.</p><p>"What are you doing?" said the Sandaime with a calm tone, completely betraying the total rage that he contains at the moment.</p><p>Ignoring the massive KI emitted by the Sandaime while also ignoring his danger senses, a man said, "We are finishing what the Fourth started! We are ending the demon!"</p><p>"So you are ending the demon..." No words are needed after that. Sandaime immediately summons his faithful companion, Enma the Monkey King and said, "Enma, bo staff. We have some people to punish."</p><p>"Finally! They shouldn't do that to a kid! I will gladly help you Hiruzen! These people should die!"</p><p>Enma then turned into a bo staff, and the Sandaime started smashing people's heads left and right, spreading blood and brain matter all over the place. The mob, thinking the Sandaime has gone crazy for them helping to rid Konoha of the demon, started to scream the fact that they are doing a service and tried running away, but they are stopped by the ANBU stationed before. Within minutes, the mob of twenty strong members have all become nothing but bloody chunks of meat, and the flames on Naruto has been put out by an ANBU with a Suiton jutsu.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Naruto was then brought into the ICU, with third degree burns all over his body, a half healed eyeball, an amputated leg, his arms skinned, his intestines only being held back by the Sandaime, multiple laceration over his body, a punctured lung, an almost punctured heart and many more. Even so, the wounds are already healing at a rapid rate, faster than anything else thought possible. After a long nine hour operation, in which Naruto ended up wrapped in bandages through his whole body and even the forcefully amputated leg managed to be reattached. Naruto ended up in a coma, both outside and inside his mind for three days. He wakes up first in his mindscape, and came face to face with an extremely angry and pissed off Kurumi.</p><p>"<b>WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING?! DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO HEAL ALL THAT INJURY?! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT DID YOU JUST DO?! DO YOU KNow how sad will it be for me if you died? Do you? Do..."</b> and then she started crying. Naruto, ever the good guy, went inside her cage and hugged her hands with his tiny body.</p><p>"I know. But I must do that. The only way for the people to not target other people as a place to release their anger is by sacrificing myself as a place for them to release their anger. I'm sorry for worrying you, but I know that you'll help me survive that. Besides, I did survive that, thanks to you, right?"</p><p>"<b>You idiot. Don't think that you're too cool just to survive that. But Naruto, to prevent you from almost dying immediately like now, I need you to do something for me. Rip off a part of the seal, about half, so that next time, I can channel more power into you to heal you better."</b></p><p>Naruto then proceeds to do just that, tearing off half the seal, before saying goodbye to Kurumi and waking up in the real world, where he immediately faces the worried face of the Sandaime.</p><p>"Naruto! You're awake! How are you my boy?"</p><p>"Hey there jii-san. I'm fine, Kurumi helped heal me, and I feel better now."</p><p>"Good. The doctors actually expected you to die due to your wounds. If not for Kurumi healing you, you really would die." Yes, the Sandaime knew of Kurumi, Kushina had invited him and Minato together to meet her within her mindscape, which makes her attack even more of a shocker for him, since he knew that she is a wise, old being.</p><p>"I really need to thank her then. Hey jii-san, Kurumi wanted me to say to you that she plans to train me in the ninja arts starting from the day I can exit the hospital. Is there any training ground that is secretive enough for me to use? She also says that she is planning to give me a bloodline limit using her chakra, so the training ground also needs to have lots of chakra suppression seals. Also, she is planning to have me leave the village for a couple of years to train myself, both in body and in mind. But the initial training is done in the village, not outside."</p><p>"Hmm... That is a very tall order, but I suppose that you can use the Hokage's Private Training Grounds, it's the only training ground that can fit all that criteria. The doctors say that you will probably be able to leave in about two days, so I will meet you again at that time, and escort you to the training ground. Is that okay with you?"</p><p>"Kurumi says that that is okay, and she says that you might want to be there as well during the process. A new blood limit is going to appear in the village, and you might want to see it."</p><p>"Then I will try to clear my schedule up to be with you at that time. Good day Naruto, and hopefully you can recover quickly from all your injuries. I have punished all those involved in the mob at that day, and may that be a lesson for all of them, so that they will not do it again."</p><p>"Thanks jii-san, though the punishing part is unnecessary, but I leave that up to you. Good day to you as well, jii-san."</p><p>Naruto's recovery went well, and after two days, he is cleared of the hospital and is being escorted by the Hokage to the Hokage's Private Training Grounds.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>"So, Kurumi-chan, can you explain to me about the new bloodline that you'll give me?"</p><p>"<b>Of course, Naruto. The bloodline limit that I will give to you is a body-based bloodline limit that changes your body so much so that even if from the outside it looks the same, your insides are extremely different. This bloodline limit gives you new internal organs that can push your body further than any other person. It will also not look too creepy like this some blood limit that causes you to have six arms or two heads </b>(Somewhere in Otogakure, three ninjas sneezed at once)."</p><p>"Oooh, that sounds really creepy (once again, the same three ninjas sneezed at once). Can you explain to me about the organs that I'll gain?"</p><p>"<b>Of course. The first organ that you'll gain is a secondary heart, giving you two hearts, each can take over the entire body's blood flow if one fails, and when both is functioning, it provides you with a massive increase in blood flow, giving you more oxygen and can prevent you from being tired.</b></p><p><b>The second organ is the Ossmodula, an organ that can strengthen, accelerates and enlarges skeletal system growth by being able to force the body to use multitudes of minerals like iron, titanium, and others to strengthen your bones, enlarging them and making them denser to the point of being almost unbreakable. You will also be much taller than other people at your maximum growth, at somewhere around two metres tall, maybe more. It will also change your rib cage, turning it into a mass of interlocking bone plates without gaps instead of a regular gaping ribcage.</b></p><p><b>The third is the Biscopea, an organ that can increase musculature growth and makes your muscles not just stronger, but denser, so much so that a regular hit from you will feel like an impact from a Doton jutsu. This organ will also help in your growth and healing as well. It will also thicken your skin, up to a point where regular thrown weapons will be unable to pierce your skin. The increased, denser muscles also give you a higher speed than is normally possible, even with chakra enhanced muscles.</b></p><p><b>The fourth is the Haemastamen, an organ that will change your blood's composition, increasing its capability to carry oxygen and nutrients to all parts of the body, thus further improving your stamina and healing, and also your growth due to better nutrient carrying capability.</b></p><p><b>The fifth is the Larraman's Organ, which produces special cells called Larraman's Cells which can seal wounds nearly instantaneously, which when combined with your natural Uzumaki healing and vitality, allows you to even regrow entire organs and limbs lost, even during the heat of battle, enabling you to fight non-stop, somewhat like a Battle Continuation skill.</b></p><p><b>The sixth organ is the Catalepsean Node, which enables you to be able to continue for days upon days without sleep, and needing only minimal sleep if any, by shutting down parts of your brain temporarily when it is unused.</b></p><p><b>The seventh organ is the Preomnor, a secondary stomach that can neutralize any and all biochemical contaminants and any poisons that you ingest, and even enables your body to create the poisons that you ate or encountered.</b></p><p><b>The eighth is the Omophagea, an organ that allows you to absorb information from enemy brains that you eat, allowing you to gain their memories and skills. Though brain eating may sound disgusting, sometimes it is the easiest way to gain more knowledge and information from an enemy, and they can even be digested by the Preomnor as well.</b></p><p><b>The ninth organ is the Multi-lung, which adds a third, special lung that at normal condition, will improve the oxygen absorption rate of the body, but will close off the two regular lungs and only uses the Multi-lung in conditions where oxygen is rare like underwater, basically you can breathe in water, or in toxic environments, where the Multi-lung will also filter out the poison or toxic contaminant and only absorbs oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide to maintain normal breathing.</b></p><p><b>The tenth organ is the Occulobe, which will improve your eyesight so much so, taht not just you can see much further than a normal human, you can also see during the darkest of nights like it's in daylight, which when combined with the Catalepsean Node, allows you to fight perfectly in any condition, ignoring lighting and the need to sleep.</b></p><p><b>The eleventh organ is the Lyman's Ear, a complete ear replacement that completely removes the effects of nausea, dizziness and vertigo due to motions and prevents a loss of balance in any condition, preventing enemies from destabilising your base. It also gives a higher and much better listening capability that after some training, you can filter out all other noise and listen to only the sound of your target, among others.</b></p><p><b>The twelfth organ is the Oolitic Kidney, a kidney that works in conjunction with the Preomnor and the Multi-lung to remove, purify and categorize any poisons, toxins and bacteria that enters your body, and sends them to the Betcher's Gland to be recreated for the body.</b></p><p><b>The thirteenth organ is the Neuroglottis, an organ that allows you to biochemically assess a wide variety of things by taste and/or smell, checking for toxicity and nutritional content to determine whether or not the substance is edible. It also allows you to track a target just by using taste and/or smell alone.</b></p><p><b>The fourteenth organ is the Mucranoid, a type of sweat glands that coats your body with a certain waxy substance that allows your body to operate at conditions where most other people would consider deadly, protecting you from extreme heat, extreme cold, and even vacuum environments. It can even cancel out the effects of some low to mid level jutsus.</b></p><p><b>The fifteenth organ is called the Betcher's Gland, which is actually two separate glands, one in the mouth in the saliva glands and one within your body, which produces a mixture of poisons that you have eaten, inhaled, injected or whatever and causes your blood to become poisonous while your saliva to be both acidic and poisonous, giving you weapons when you have none and allows your own body to gain a last ditch victory against an enemy via your blood. The acidic saliva also allows you to digest stuff that most consider inedible like concrete and metal, and the acidic saliva appears only when consciously triggered, to prevent tragedies during certain... intimate events </b>(Kurumi is blushing at this point, though Naruto, with his usual thick headedness, did not see anything wrong about this)<b>.</b></p><p><b>The sixteenth organ is called the Linker Core, and will be a second chakra core for your body, in that it regulates, controls and manages the production, suppression, and usage of your chakra and youki in the future towards the surroundings and everything around you, in that it will work together with the Progenoid Glands to properly release only the required amounts of chakra for a jutsu, giving you perfect chakra control at any moment, though you can still overcharge a jutsu manually by forcing the Linker Core to pour more chakra into a jutsu, and automatically when the jutsu used is the one you just learned. All the unneeded chakra within your body will be stored within this organ, and will be released into your chakra network as necessary, not just preventing any chakra waste and allowing you to have theoretically limitless chakra due to the regeneration being higher than the usage, it also makes people underestimate you due to them thinking that you are just a civilian because most of your chakra is within the Core, instead of your chakra coils. It will also prevent your chakra network from being blocked, since the Progenoid Glands will order the Linker Core to release a pulse of chakra if it detects foreign chakra within your chakra system. This will also act as a chakra exercise for your first chakra core, situated at the navel since extra chakra is always diverted to the Linker Core, it forces the first core to produce more and more chakra to refill your system which will stay almost permanently low, except in battle situations.</b></p><p><b>The seventeenth and most important organ of all is the Progenoid Glands, which acts as a second brain that controls the functionality and synergy between all the new organs and the original organs and allows you to let go of some of the functionality to the Gland, thus making you an even more effective fighting machine then what you are now. It also provides you with numerous other effects, like a perfect immune system where you won't be downed by any disease, natural or artificial, better reaction time due to enhanced synaptic connection between the brain cells, among others. It also prevents you from being caught in any kind of genjutsu since you will have a second brain that will check all sensory inputs and body and chakra status to see if there is any discrepancy between the inputs and will order the Linker Core to release a chakra pulse if it detected otherwise. It also can potentially give you psychic abilities, though this will only appear when your mind is trained enough.</b></p><p><b>This bloodline is what I call the Astartes bloodline, and it will be inherited without fail by your (or our...she whispers) children, though I will not know what to expect when they are born with the enhancements."</b></p><p>"WOW! That's a whole lot of enhancements! Can you really do all that?"</p><p>"<b>Of course I can! Do you doubt me?"</b></p><p>"Nope, just asking."</p><p>"So, Naruto, what's the new bloodline that Kurumi is going to give you about?"</p><p>"Well jiji, it's like this..."</p><p>And thus Naruto repeats the explanation given to him by Kurumi. By the end of the explanation, the Sandaime is totally flabbergasted by the sheer complexity and potential of the bloodline.</p><p>"So is there anything else you would need for your training and the bloodline implementation?"</p><p>"Hmm... Kurumi-chan says that I will need food, lots and lots of it, a hunk of metal, metal dust preferred, easier to digest. Can you get that? She says that she will start the process in a couple of minutes, and she hoped that all the stuff will be there by the time she finishes modifying me."</p><p>"Okay Naruto. I will gather the stuff that you need and have an ANBU deliver them here later. Is that fine? I cannot stay here to see the bloodline be implemented, I still have many tasks to do."</p><p>"It's okay jiji. I understand. I'll ask her if she could start the process immediately or not."</p><p>"<b>Due to you ripping off part of the seal, I can start immediately. Be warned that the process will be extremely painful, so much so that you will faint. Sit or lie down and prepare yourself."</b></p><p>After lying down on the training ground's grass, Naruto tells Kurumi to start the process, after which he is shrouded in crimson chakra before he felt like his body is being torn apart and ripped from all sides before he gets knocked out to blissful unconsciousness, unknowing of the changes currently being done on his body.</p><p>-STORY END-</p><p>Aaaand there's chapter one! So I used a Space Marine's organs. They're extremely awesome, and it is just waiting for someone to use it in another fanfic as whatever. Also, most fics give Naruto either a dojutsu or a chakra based bloodline (Hyoton, Yoton, etc) and not many gives him a body based bloodline (Dead Bone Pulse, etc), so I decided to make one that uses a new, body based bloodline. A Primarch's body, in fact. Except modified a bit so that it can fit within Narutoverse. This will NOT be a full Warhammer 40k crossover, the only part that uses it is Naruto's bloodline, and maybe some force weaponry or some other suitable melee weaponry. So as my last words for this chapter, please read and review!</p><p>EDIT: Also added the Linker Core to give a new chakra processing facility for Naruto.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Hello everyone! I'm on a fucking roll right now! Can't believe that I managed to publish 3 chapters in a week! But really, don't expect this update rate to continue, and please take the warning that I had said about the update rate at the prologue chapter seriously! So without further ado, here's the second chapter of A Loving Mind, A Body of Steel! But first, guest review replies here:</P><P>Guest1: Uh... I don't think you are getting the point of the new organs. It's not that more organs the better. It's that the new organs improve his combat prowess to an unprecedented level. Also, this idea is original in that no one has used the idea of Naruto having an Astartes' body on this site as of yet. The organs are from the Adeptus Astartes in Warhammer 40,000 (copyright Games Workshop) except for the Linker Core, which is from Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha (Copyright Seven Arcs).</P><P>Chapter 2 : Training Time!</P><P>-STORY START-</P><P>"Urgh, my head... what hit me?"</P><P>Naruto woke up with a start, and saw that there is no one around him, not Jiji, nor his ANBU. The only thing available that he could see within his immediate vicinity, especially due to his somehow blurry eyesight, is a bunch of scrolls that he cannot, for the life of him, remember having with him when he entered the training ground. He tried moving his arm while trying to listen for the presence of anyone within the training ground, and that's when the sensations from his new, improved senses hit him like an avalance.</P><P>His sight, previously blurry and dark-ish, suddenly became clearer than ever thought possible! He saw that the moon is concealed by dark rainclouds and that there is almost absolutely no light, yet he can see everything around him like its daylight! The movement of grasses due to the wind, the leaves of the tree, even the veins of the leaves, he can even see that tiny tick trying to burrow through the tree's trunk, even the lines of seals on the ground, and immediately remembered the pattern, and when he looked up, he saw a bluish dome shaped barrier around the training grounds. If his sight before the augmentation is already good, this makes his sight before seem like a blind man's!</P><P>His hearing, unable to hear anything when he wakes up, suddenly is able to pick up every single sound of the wind blowing, every tiny rustle of leaves, every tiny little critter running on the ground, he can even hear that mouse digging a hole to run away from a nearby forest cat, which he can hear it's breathing, ready to pounce towards the rat, a series of actions that he sees when he turns his extreme sight to. He heard the rustle of branches, the flow of the wind whooshing as the cat lunged to the rat, and heard their scuffle.</P><P>His sense of smell, already stronger than usual before, can suddenly smell the ground due to the cat, the smell of the rat's blood, the scent that marks this place as the cat's territory, the smell of iron – from the scrolls, he realised – the smell of paper and ink – also from the scrolls –, the scents of nature around him.</P><P>All these new levels of sensory input, combined with the fact that other than his head, he cannot move any other part of his body as of yet, causes our hero to black out once again. And wakes up again in about an hour, with both his brain and the Progenoid Glands functioning at full capacity to control the sensory inputs, his Larraman's Organ and natural Uzumaki vitality already working to heal and better assimilate all the new functions of his body. A couple of seconds later, the healing has completed and he wakes up with a groan.</P><P>"Wow... That felt like I had lava pumped into my insides. Through every hole that I have! Damn that hurts! But damn if the results isn't great. I can see like it's daytime! The smells... These are great! Also my ears... these are just... I have no idea what to say. Kurumi-chan, these are awesome!" said Naruto loudly, before his stomach grumbled so loudly, he fell on the ground, hugging his stomach. "But why am I so hungry...? I feel like I can eat this entire forest and come back for more!"</P><P>"<B>That's because you probably can. Due to your new body and organs, you can literally eat anything you want, without getting sick and still retain their nutrients and benefits. Also, the changes to your body use a lot of energy and I am forced to cannibalize resources from other body parts just to create the new organs. That growling is most probably due to your Progenoid Glands forcing you to eat more to replace the lost nutrients and to create new muscles and bones for your body."</B></P><P>"That is cool and all, but what am I supposed to eat? The trees around us?"</P><P>"<B>Not that you can't, you definitely can eat them if you'd like, but there are those sealing scrolls that the old man left for us right? Better unseal the stuff inside and see what he left for you. Also, due to me forcing my chakra all around you, you have your chakra unlocked, and your Linker Core is now functioning at full capacity."</B></P><P>Hearing that suggestion, Naruto immediately woke up and reached for the scroll closest to him and opened it, revealing a series of weird squiggles on it which represents the simplest seals to learn, storage seals. Unsealing whatever is inside, a huge pile of iron dust appeared, probably taken from smiths in the village, and fell to the ground.</P><P>"What the fuck?! Why did Jiji gave me a pile of iron dust? Do I really need to eat this stuff?"</P><P>"<B>Yes you do. The Ossmodula will rebuild your skeletal system using tougher materials, and for that, you need to eat a lot of other weird, usually inedible materials like iron, rocks, trees and other bones, especially from other species. They may taste like crap, but they are undeniably digestible thanks to the acidic nature of your saliva due to your Betcher's Gland. So say your prayers and start eating!"</B> Kurumi shouted.</P><P>"Okay, okay..." Having said his piece and made peace with the fact that he will need to eat weird stuff for the rest of his not considerable lifetime, he sat on the ground, took a deep breath and a handful of iron dust and started eating them.</P><P>"Yuck! This stuff tastes like... like... like steel! They even have that weird oily taste! They are extremely weird! And smells like floorboards! Urgh! But I can even feel my spit melting them in my mouth. That feels weird by the way."</P><P>"<B>You'll get used to it later on. Your Preomnor will help digest it further, than your stomach will absorb them, and the Haemastamen will use it to create a new skeletal system for you, one that is much tougher and is almost unbreakable by anything. So shut up, hold your thoughts and continue eating that iron dust! You'll need to eat all of those and then some, since you'll grow tall, in fact, taller than anyone else that you'll find or will ever meet. So, you'll need all the nutrients that you can have. You'll also need to eat a lot of meat to gain proteins for the Biscopea to create the muscular mass that you will have. I suggest you eat about one to two kilograms of meat a day for optimal muscle development."</B></P><P>Naruto, grumbling and complaining, still managed to finish eating the pile of iron dust and started unsealing the second scroll, which contains meat, raw, and freshly slain, looking at the blood that was still red in the meat, probably due to the stasis nature of a sealing scroll. Looking at this, Naruto starts to question the mind of the Sandaime.</P><P>"Look, I know that Jiji is old and all, but I doubt that he's that bad that he remembers that I am just a kid, and can't eat uncooked meat!"</P><P>While Naruto is ranting his ass out due to the Sandaime, Kurumi decided to butt in before his rantings starts to get weirder.</P><P>"<B>Naruto, I know that you are thinking that you cannot eat raw meat. This is not true actually. Thanks to your new organs, you can eat raw meat of any kind without any consequence. In fact, starting today, it is better for you to start getting used to eating food raw, since you can gain muscle memories due to your Omophagea by eating an enemy's body parts, or their knowledge and memories by eating their brains. So, learn to eat raw, and eat that meat now."</B></P><P>Grumbling again, Naruto then starts eating the meat provided by the Sandaime. Over the course of half an hour, Naruto has unsealed all the scrolls, and had finished eating all the food that the Sandaime provided.</P><P>"*Burp* Huh... That's a lot of food... but I haven't felt tired or sleepy at all, and I felt like I can still continue doing anything and everything else! Awesome!"</P><P>"<B>Of course! The other organs within your body helps give you extra energy due to increased blood flow and oxygen level, thus giving you near infinite stamina, and the capability to stay awake without resting for long periods of time!"</B></P><P>"But Kurumi-chan, I just realised something. Even though I said that I will bring peace and remove everyone's hatred, why do I need this body? This body of steel?"</P><P>"<B>Naruto... you are still young, and thus you did not see the dark side of the world. In order to bring peace to the world, you need to be strong, stronger than anyone and anything, and probably strong enough to take on the gods themselves and win. Because, to gain peace, you must end wars. And to end war, you need to enter wars. And you cannot survive in wars, unless you are strong. So be strong, stronger than ever, for the path to peace is littered with the bodies of warmongers."</B></P><P>Naruto, feeling grimmer, and getting a feeling to lighten up the mood, just nodded and asked Kurumi, "So what should I do now? Since I am unable to sleep, just standing around doing nothing would not be a good idea. Heck, just thinking of sitting down for hours upon hours makes me feel bad."</P><P>"<B>Hm... what about if you try to hunt, or at the very least, just go ahead and chase an animal or two in the grounds. By doing so, you can get used to your senses' new levels, and will have no problem utilising them to its maximum later when necessary. You will also need to eat them, most preferably raw, so that you won't freak out when you need to jump towards a human target and eat his brain to get some information quick enough </B>(here, Naruto pales, and almost started dry heaving). <B>I have taught you the ways of stealth, and to hunt your prey well, you must be able to utilise them to its maximum. Now off with you, while I think of what else can be done to help you with your new body."</B></P><P>Naruto nodded, and took off into the nearby woods in the training grounds to hunt for small critters that he managed to see with his new eyesight. He also realises that he is able to see chakra within a living thing, and a certain yellowish haze that surrounds everything that he can see. Chakra within a rabbit that he was tracking glowed blue, though the glow within the rabbit is weak, probably due to the extremely small amount of chakra that it has. Using the stealth knowledge that he was taught by Kurumi, he sneaks around the woods, tracking his prey through his chakra-seeing eyes.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Meanwhile, Kurumi is busy thinking about what to teach Naruto and how to enable him to utilise his new bloodline to it's limits.</P><P>"<I><B>Dammit, I know I did something wrong! I should've thought about how to train him first before giving him the bloodline. Oh well. No better time than now. Well, first he needs to learn to use his muscles first. So... This is what his schedule will look like, I guess:</B></I></P><P><B>0600-1000 : Physical training (using boulders/trees, anything viable) </B></P><P><B>1000-1400 : Spar with ANBU (requested from Hiruzen)</B></P><P><B>1400-1800 : Chakra control practice</B></P><P><B>1800-2200 : Taijutsu practice (need a tough trainer or training post), teach him the Whirlpool Fist.</B></P><P><B>2200-2300 : Rest a.k.a. meditation period</B></P><P><B>2300-0400 : Hunting (stealth, tracking training, senses practice)</B></P><P><B>0400-0600 : Study period</B></P><P><I><B>We won't start jutsu training first, only when we have left the village will we be able to start full jutsu and elemental training. He should master the usage of his muscles and body functions first, then we can go to jutsu usage and skills. He needs to be able to tank massive damages just from his skin, bones and regeneration, which will also increase his pain tolerance, though the Progenoid Glands will take care of the pain sensation. Hm..He seems to have gotten used to his new senses, though the capability to see chakra is something totally unexpected. Oh well. That's good, that he can see chakra. People cannot hide from him at all, either stealth assassins or chakra using illusions, not that he can be hit by illusions anyway. So better let him get started tonight before next morning."</B></I></P><P>"<B>Naruto, I think you can go ahead, catch that rabbit, eat him and we can begin your physical training. I will also tell you your future schedule, though some of them may only be done after we spoke to Sandaime."</B></P><P>With that, Naruto started to lunge towards the unsuspecting rabbit, caught it using his hand before rolling around to bleed off the momentum from the unsuspectingly fast jump, only his Astartes reaction allowing him to still retain the rabbit within his arm and caught the critter in the first place. He then stood there, stupefied, with the critter struggling to get out of his strong grip.</P><P>"Holy fucking shit! Did I really do that?! That was way cool!"</P><P>"<B>Of course. With all the enhancements done to your body, not just that you can do anything and everything faster, stronger and better, your reaction times also dropped to an extreme level, where even highly trained ninja cannot follow you. Now, go ahead and eat the rabbit, preferably raw."</B></P><P>"But how am I going to do that?! I have no knife or whatever equipment with me!"</P><P>"<B>*sighs* Just bite it in the neck. You may get sprayed with blood, in fact, you definitely will, but that is what you need to get used to. I am planning for you to learn to get used with bathing yourself with the blood of your enemies. Remember, that to seek peace, you will encounter many enemies that seek to make war as their way to gain. These people will later be your target. You need to get used to both killing and getting sprayed with blood fast. Now go ahead and eat that rabbit, while I explain what your schedule is for the whole day."</B></P><P>Feeling squeamish but still deciding to follow what his Kurumi-chan said, he immediately bit into the neck of the rabbit, earning frightened shrieks and a shower of rabbit arterial blood before the rabbit quiets down, and Naruto, managing to hold his bile down, immediately bit into the flesh of the rabbit, breaking through both bone and flesh with ease using his Astartes strength enhanced jaw, all while listening to Kurumi explain to him about his schedule later. A couple of minutes later, he finished eating the rabbit, with his mouth, face, body and arms covered with rabbit's blood like a blood drinking vampire. All the while, being extremely excited to start his training.</P><P>"So, Kurumi-chan, what shall I do first?"</P><P>"<B>First you will start with a run. Run around the training grounds for two hours. I will time it for you, then you'll do 2000 pushups, 2000 jumping jacks, 2000 sit ups, 2000 crunches and a whole lot of other excercises. While doing all this, you must still train your senses, being able to detect everyone and everything within your vicinity just by using hearing and smell, to increase both your perception skill and to further get you used to the new stronger senses. So go ahead and start now!"</B></P><P>Chirping happily, Naruto started his run around the training ground as his warm up, and after an hour, found out that while Kurumi is a wise and nice girl-fox thing, he is a slave driver at training. If not for his Astartes constitution, he would've died. In fact, he realises that after every exercise that he did, the next exercise would get easier. In fact, by the end, he thought that 2000 repetitions of the exercises just didn't feel hard to him, so he decided to voice his thoughts to Kurumi.</P><P>"Kurumi-chan, I kinda found out that after every exercise, it seems much easier, like there is no weight at all, so much so that it's like every exercise that I am doing is not making any effect. Is it because of my bloodline again?"</P><P>"<B>Yes. Even on the fly, the Progenoid Glands are already detecting the amount of muscular strength and force needed to perform all the activities and forces the Biscopea to produce more and more muscle fibres and making them denser, the Ossmodula to create and strengthen your bones further to prevent the muscles from breaking your own bone due to their density and the Larraman's Organ to heal all your used muscles, forcing you to gain more and more muscle mass, bone density and height. Wait until Sandaime sees you now, he'll think that you're someone else. Now that'll be funny."</B></P><P>"Wow! But that kinda makes physical training worthless, seeing that my body will adapt to it nearly instantly. Or am I wrong in that?"</P><P>"<B>Yes you are wrong. Your body may be able to adapt to any condition almost immediately, in minutes at most, but physical training allows you to move those new adaptations well, and also allows you to use those muscles as speed instead of using them just to hit harder. So no matter how, speed training, at the very least, is important, extremely so. Now, since your body has adapted to the exercises, go and run around the grounds as fast as you can, and don't stop until the Hokage came by."</B></P><P>And with a cheerful "Okay!" from Naruto, he started running around the training ground, and two hours later, when he is well into his sixtieth round at full speed, the Sandaime came by, and almost struck at the stranger running around the training ground. Only, at closer look, the one he taught was a stranger is actually a Naruto who, overnight, had grown from a 2' 3" scrawny four year old into a 3' 1" kid who somehow seems to have more muscles on his body than Maito Gai, Konoha's taijutsu expert, and is ripped by the looks of it. His original clothes that he gave him, which is actually clothing meant for older children, is suddenly much more filled than he can ever thought possible within just one night. His pipe almost fell, when Naruto, who had detected the Sandaime through the smell of tobacco from his pipe, stopped running in his circuit and ran towards the Hokage, who is still trying to process the extremely rapid growth that Naruto went through in just a night. <I>"I guess the bloodline that Kurumi gave him is really, really powerful."</I></P><P>"So how are you this beautiful Naruto? You seem to have grown rapidly, and from the looks of it, you are still not tired yet from that run just now."</P><P>"Yup! Kurumi-chan says that the growth is due to the Biscopea and the Ossmodula, which changes my height, and I have actually started running right after I ate that rabbit I caught. Let me tell you Jiji, eating raw rabbit stomach and liver tastes like shit! I have also been doing many exercises that Kurumi-chan told me to! They're good! And I have been running for hours! She says that my muscles are much, much tougher now, thanks as well to the food that you gave!"</P><P>Now the Sandaime's jaws fell to the ground. From what he can deduce, he's been running for around 2 hours, the does exercises that would knock out if not outright kill most of his Jounins, then continued running until he came! And other than the amount of sweat, he doesn't seem winded, not at all! Such stamina! <I>"I guess what Kurumi said about near infinite stamina, and can even go without sleeping for days is true after all,"</I> Sandaime muses.</P><P>"Anyway, Jiji, you better hear the training schedule that Kurumi-chan created for me!"</P><P>"Oh? So let's hear it."</P><P>So for the next couple of minutes, Naruto filled his Jiji up on his insane training schedule, well, insane for everyone else, on what he will need to train his body further, and the current capabilitiesof his body. Needless to say, Sarutobi went beyond shocked and straight into 'I-am-not-listening-to-this-shit' territory.</P><P>"...And i can see the glowing blue stuff in ninjas, and you have, like, a lot, Jiji!"</P><P>"What? Huh? Yeah, of course, I'm the Hokage!"</P><P>The clearing was suddenly hit with a massive wave of silence, with only the wind blowing, and Naruto looks at the Hokage with a look that says 'you-are-not-listening-to-any-of-my-shit' and decided to voice his thoughts. "You didn't hear anything I said after the early parts didn't you?"</P><P>"What? Of course I did! *clears throat* Anyway, so you need an ANBU member here every day to spay with you, to improve both your reflexes and your speed? I think I have just the one for you. Cat, to me!"</P><P>Naruto, who fell for the Sandaime's skilful art of attention diversion and is currently jumping for joy to see his new sparring (or beating) partner, didn't see the ANBU that shunshined from somewhere to right beside the Hokage, kneeling. "What can I do for you, Hokage-sama?" said the ANBU, codename Cat.</P><P>An ANBU, wearing a cat mask with long, purple hair, with a sword sheathed at her back – a girl, thought Naruto – appeared beside the Hokage, awating orders.</P><P>"Cat, this is Uzumaki Naruto, as you have known, and as you may have heard, you will be his sparring partner for four hours, non-stop if possible, and will not hold back on him, except on truly deadly hits, decapitation especially. Heart stabs, kidney shots, even dismemberments are fine."</P><P>"But Hokage-sama... He won't be able to be a ninja-" her tirade was cut short by the Sandaime who raised his hand to stop the protests of the ANBU on the violence level that will be unleashed on the kid.</P><P>"Naruto told me before that his enhanced body will probably have no problems fighting, even with lost limbs and damaged organs. The main reason this can even happen is due to his new bloodline's extreme regeneration capabilities. He even said that it can regenerate from attacks that will kill most, if not every people, and he has a number of organs that can replace or take over the function of the main organ if the main organ is damaged. Not just that, he can also heal from near lethal damages to his internal organs, and has the potential to even reattach dismembered limbs naturally, though this is not confirmed. So, do not be afraid about him, and don't hold back. Show him what level is he expected to achieve in one year. Though if you were to deal a critical damage, please give him some time to heal it first before continuing the spar."</P><P>"...Hai, Hokage-sama. I will do my best." Though reluctant, an order is an order, and Yuugao is not one of the most loyal ANBU in Konoha, and such a title didn't come by disobeying orders. And so, with the Hokage watching, Naruto and Yuugao got into their respective positions, with Yuugao not drawing her sword, thinking to attack him with fists and jutsu first and stood in the standard Academy taijutsu stance and Naruto in a brawler's stance.</P><P>"Begin!" said the Sandaime, and almost instantly Yuugao is in front of Naruto, fist cocked back with chakra, ready to pound him. However, Naruto isn't a regular kid, and is able to see how Yuugao is charging chakra to her legs with his eyes, and readied himself to take or deflect any attack that she made. When Yuugao's fist came within his sight, with speeds that shocked even Sandaime, he dodged the fist and sends his own fist, albeit with a shorter range due to him having a nine year old's body at best, but still managed to hit Yuugao's jounin vest. Feeling the hit, which somehow felt like a punch from Kakashi, she backpedalled, narrowed her eyes behind her mask, and thought, <I>"That is powerful! It almost tore through my flak vest! Gotta get a check for it later, but now, I got a kid to pummel."</I></P><P>Yuugao then decides to use shunshin to appear directly in front of Naruto, her leg cocked back and ready to kick Naruto like a football. But somehow, Naruto managed to dodge her kick, and tried grabbing her leg, but she sidestepped instantly and sends a powerful knee to his back at full power, capable of breaking bones and paralysing someone if hit at the right place, but Naruto managed to counter the knee strike with his own elbow, and to her utter shock and surprise, the knee, charged with chakra and ready to smash Naruto's head, felt like it hit a wall of iron, before she felt her knee broken to pieces. Meanwhile, Naruto, who had just finished the spinning elbow strike counter to Yuugao's knee, followed through with the momentum of his spin and punched her in the stomach with his other hand and managed to hit, almost breaking through her flak vest. Yuugao was sent flying, still in shock at what happened to her. <I>"What? What are his bones made of? Diamonds?i never felt like that when hitting someone, even with body armour on! And I think I'm having a bruised stomach, and maybe some bruised organs as well. I felt like a mountain just crashed on me! Just what is he?"</I></P><P>Meanwhile, in Naruto's mind, <I>"Damn! She's fast! Only due to my reaction speed and capability to see chakra did I managed to counter her. I guess those sense training paid off now. I think I can feel my surroundings without even seeing them! This is awesome! I only managed to get one hit on her, but it's time to take the fight to her!"</I> with those words, Naruto immediately charged Yuugao who is still dazed and lying down due to the powerful hit by Naruto and her broken knee, and didn't react in time when Naruto reached her position and lifted his hand to punch her before the Sandaime shouted "Stop! This spar is over! Naruto, stand down! Yuugao, what happened to you?"</P><P>"Hokaage-sama, I, I... might've broken my knee and had a couple of my organs bruised. I better go and get treatment for these quick. Naruto, you are powerful, extremely so. Please train further, not just to gain more power, but to learn to control those powers as well. Farewell." She says, before with the help of ANBU Boar,who appeared beside her in a shunshin, she managed to hobble her way out of the training ground, and to the hospital. At the hospital, the doctor that checks her says to her that her injuries looks like an injury that happens when someone spars with Tsunade's disciple. Her response: "It sure felt like it, doc... Sure did..."</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Meanwhile, back at the training ground, another ANBU, this time ANBU Mantis, is up against Naruto. Once again, both of them stood in their positions, with them standing in their respective stances. Sandaime lifts his hand, shouts "Begin!" and they're off. But this time, Naruto realises something different about the man. The bluish thingy in his body is much more agitated, with them flowing chaotically. Not thinking anything about this, Naruto tried the same strategy, but to his surprise, instead of entering a taijutsu battle, the ANBU ran through some hand seals and shouted Katon: Grand Fireball! Immediately, a huge ball of flame rushed towards the charging Naruto, who had Kurumi screaming her tails off in his head.</P><P>"<B>GET AWAY FROM THAT FIREBALL YOU IDIOT! REGENERATION OR NOT, YOU WON'T GO UNSCATHED THROUGH THAT FIREBALL!"</B></P><P>"But I thought you said that I need to learn to take damage as well as giving them? This looks like a good idea!"</P><P>"<B>YOU FOOL! UNLESS IF YOU HAVE A CHAKRA SHROUD AROUND YOU, THERE IS NO WAY THAT THAT FIREBALL WON'T HARM YOU!"</B></P><P>"Chakra shroud... Wait, I have an idea!"</P><P>Despite all the protests and obscenities that the bijuu screamed towards his mental ear, Naruto gathered his not inconsiderable amounts of chakra, surrounds himself with it and charged the fireball, hoping for the best.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>The Sandaime, who thought that the ANBU would just use taijutsu is also shocked when the fireball came out of the ANBU's mouth, and is even more shocked when Naruto, who previously shows a reaction faster than most jounins, charged straight towards the fireball. In shock, his fingers are already going through the handseals for a Doton: Mud Wall, when a huge flare of chakra, even bigger than anything he has seen in the past ten years occurred, with the centre being Naruto, before the chakra flare recedes back, and Naruto is engulfed in the fireball. Thoroughly shocked, Hiruzen didn't even react to the shouts of "The Demon is dead!" coming from Mantis, who is so happy he almost let loose a maniacal laugh, when suddenly, after the fireball dissipates, stood Naruto, with just some burns on his body, though most of his clothes are burned.</P><P>"What?! How did you survived that?!" Mantis screamed, not believing the sight in front of his eyes.</P><P>"Well, even Kurumi-chan said that I won't survive that, at least without some injuries, and she said that only if I had her chakra shroud then I'd survive, so I thought, why not use my chakra? So I gathered my chakra, and compress them around my skin as some sort of armour. Hey, that'll work! I guess I'll call this jutsu Chakra Armour! Haha! Now I just need to try it some more, after Kurumi-chan shuts her mouth from cursing me."</P><P>"<B>YOU IDIOT! USING SUCH AN UNTESTED JUTSU IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE! ESPECIALLY ONE JUST BASED ON A THEORY! YOU'RE LUCKY IT WORKED, YOU BLOODY IDIOT! YOU USELESS PATHETIC IDIOT! YOU... *unintelligible screaming*"</B></P><P>"But at least, know that I am YOUR idiot, Kurumi-chan"</P><P>Hearing that, Kurumi immediately stopped screaming, and a blush, if an extremely tall, nine tailed fox-like chakra being can blush, appeared on her face.</P><P>"<B>Y-you idiot... Don't say something like that..."</B></P><P>Naruto just giggled ightly, before realising that the spar is still on, and the ANBU has appeared in front of him, tanto drawn and ready to stab it at his heart. Shocked, Naruto didn't manage to dodge the hit, and took it full on. The ANBU's victory cry is short-lived, however, when he found out that his sword couldn't penetrate Naruto's ribs.</P><P>"My bones are also enhanced, you know. Due to one of the organs in my body, I have much tougher than regular bones, almost unbreakable and uncuttable. Also, it makes my ribcage, instead of a literal cage, changes it into multiple overlapping bone plates to prevent any attacks from being able to damage my lungs or heart directly."</P><P>Naruto then proceeds to catch the arm of the ANBU and pulls him close, which the ANBU reacts by pulling out a kunai and tried to stab Naruto, who had activated the Chakra Armor again to test its defence against physical attacks, and succeeded in only hitting the bluish colour of Naruto's compressed chakra that made his chakra armor, and doing nothing. Grinning widely, Naruto then tugged the ANBU's arms again, and punched him square at the face, breaking his jaw, cheekbones, loosened the jaw's ligaments, smashes a couple of teeth, and just changing his masked face from just a mask to a mask within a face, sending him to the ground writhing in agony.</P><P>The Sandaime, once again shocked beyond words on what just happened didn't even react or said anything, even when the rest of his ANBU subdued Mantis who was still screaming wordless screams of pain and brought him in front of the Sandaime. Then, suddenly, the Sandaime woke up from his stupor and went to Naruto, completely ignoring the platoon of ANBU beside him. He went to Naruto, who is still beaming, and slapped him the face, hard.</P><P>The entire clearing went silent. Nothing made a sound. Not Naruto, not the Sandaime, not the ANBU, not the animals, heck, even Kurumi was shocked. He then proceeded to do something that he have not done for a long time: he hugged Naruto."Naruto, don't you ever,EVER, do that again. You have shocked this old man's heart enough today. Please, do not do that again."</P><P>Naruto's eyes softened during this. He thought that the old man was about cry, and his chakra is also swirling, albeit softer and less chaotic than that ANBU from before.</P><P>"Okay, old man. I won't do that again, though you can see that I am unharmed. So, can you let me borrow some o]more of your ANBU for my spar?"</P><P>Chuckling lightly, Sarutobi agreed to his demands, and ordered three ANBUs to be his sparring partner.</P><P>"But Hokage-sama, what about this guy *pointing at Mantis*?"</P><P>"Oh, him? I'll bring him myself personally to Ibiki, and see if he can make him talk. Ibiki <I>likes</I> meeting traitors, and an ANBU is no different than any other person, in the end."</P><P>And with Mantis in hand, he shunshined out of the grounds, while the rest of the ANBU turned to look at Naruto, who just looks at them and asks, "Okay, so who's next?", by which the three ANBUs only sweatdropped at the kid's act.</P><P>By the end of the 3 hour time allocated by Kurumi for the practice, the three ANBUs are tired and exhausted, while Naruto still looks fresh as a daisy. The ANBUs are shocked by Naruto's capabilities! Some of their hits are dodged or countered, and those are hits from blind spots! For the attacks that hit, his newly gained Chakra Armour blocks most, if not all of the damage. He can even react when the ANBU stops holding back, though he could only dodge or blocks the attacks. Even some of their jutsus didn't phase the blonde! Their Suiton jutsus didn't do shit, he tanks a Water Dragon like it's made of tissue paper, heck, he even breathes in it! Katon jutsus left only minimal burns, blocked by his Chakra Armour, and those burns heal in seconds! The ANBUs are flabbergasted, and consequently got tired, and is still unable to harm the kid by much. Now they understand why the kid was called the stamina demon.</P><P>"<B>Alright Naruto. Now, we'll go to the next part of your training, which is chakra control. For this, I will teach you one jutsu that will help you immensely, the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu. This skill will create actual copies of you that dispels in one hit. Though they are good for reconnaissance, they are also good for training, if you have the chakra for it, because all that your clone learns, you will too. So this will speed up your training, and will have further use in the future, but for now we will use it just for training purposes. I will transfer the information on this jutsu directly to your brain, so prepare for a short headache."</B></P><P>Before Naruto could ask what she means by that, a searing pain struck his head, though it lasts for only a second or so before he could feel it disappearing, probably being healed by his Larraman's Organ. He then immediately placed his fingers in the special handseal for Kage Bunshin no Jutsu before shouting "Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!" while pouring as much chakra as he can into the technique. A second, and a massive poof of smoke later, the clearing was filled with hundreds upon hundreds of Naruclones, and he didn't even feel the drain! "Wow! That is awesome! There's thousands of me! So what should I do now?"</P><P>"<B>Now we'll do the basic academy chakra control exercise first, the Leaf Sticking exercise. To do this, you and your clones must look for a leaf and stick them to your forehead using only chakra. Too much chakra and the leaf will shoot off, too little and it won't stick. This will be a very hard exercise, because the chakra contained within your Linker Core is probably three times as many than Hiruzen's. So this will be extremely hard and will take a massive amount of focus, but it will be a very good exercise for you. After you managed to stick one leaf to your forehead for ten minutes, then we will continue with the next exercise."</B></P><P>All the Naruclones then proceeds to take a leaf each from a nearby tree and starts to stick them on their foreheads, though the result varies. Some of the leaves just disintegrated, probably due to the sheer amount of chakra placed, some was destroyed, and some rocketed towards other clones. After 3 hours, the clones still didn't manage to stick the leaves to their foreheads, though a couple managed to stick them for a second or two.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>"<B>All right Naruto. Now on to the next stage of your training, taijutsu. For this training, I will teach you the taijutsu skill of your ancestors, the Whirlpool Fist. This taijutsu is a type of taijutsu that utilises grapples and holds, to easily place seals on your opponents to either disable them or to kill them outright. But they also contain strike moves that can be used during the moment the opponents are paralyzed and/or disabled. And combined with your strength, this can probably break bones and/or damage organs, and might even downright kill enemies. And for extra brutality, you can probably tear off you enemies' limbs from their bodies, just for the heck of it </B>(Naruto's face turned green at this point, and is about to throw up, thinking about ripping off his enemies' arms and legs while being showered with their blood)<B>. But first, you must dispel all of your clones to gain their knowledge, then we can start by making more clones to learn this style, while you will learn to properly punch and kick. So go ahead and dispel all those clones now."</B></P><P>Naruto then proceeds to dispel all the clones, which gave him quite the headache, which took longer to heal this time, around two minutes, while his head are swamped with the knowledge of all the clones that did the Leaf Sticking exercise, and looking at everything from thousands of new perspective at once. It is confusing, but he is sure that he'll get used to it in no time. He decided to test his current skill with the Leaf Sticking exercise, and managed to stick the leaf on his forehead for about five seconds. Considering that an achievement for the day, especially with his almost-bijuu level chakra, he created a couple hundred more clones and told a third of them to train the Leaf Sticking exercise so that they can improve his chakra control quickly, while another third practices the Chakra Armour so that it flares less chakra, and so that he is able to do it subconsciously, while a third will get teaching on the Whirlpool Fist from the clones of Kurumi within each of them (AN: Kage Bunshin also splits her chakra, so each of them gets a part of her, albeit much weaker. And we will only hear Kurumi Prime speaking, unless necessary. So any Kurumi speech after this is Kurumi Prime, unless said.), while the boss weill practice his punches and kicks. They pitied the trees, boulders and person that becomes his punching bag later.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>After breaking a lot of trees, and almost deforesting a quarter of the training grounds, Naruto had managed to learn well the ways of punching and kicking people, though he didn't advance far through the katas of Whirlpool Fist, since it involves grapples and holds, and Naruto isn't much of a fan of patient fighting, but Kurumi said that this will improve his patience and will help when he has mastered seals until he can make them with the use of chakra only, like his father and Mito before him, so he trudged along with the training. And, as Kurumi has scheduled, it is time for his rest, or more accurately, meditation period, though his clones will keep up his training in chakra control, Chakra Armor, and his taijutsu, or at least that's what he thought, until Kurumi called to him and said something to him that shocked him.</P><P>"<B>Naruto, dispel all of the clones that are learning the Whirlpool Fist, and make a new batch."</B></P><P>"Eh? But why? I thought I need to learn the Whirlpool Fist faster?"</P><P>"<B>The new batch will learn something even more important: meditation."</B></P><P>"What? You mean learn to sit around in a funky pose and empty our mind?"</P><P>"<B>Yes, but that is not all. The 'sitting in a funky pose' meditation is also important, in that it teaches you to sit still, to conserve energy like when being on a hunt, and improves concentration and teaches patience, but the second is more important. This is called 'battlefield meditation'. In this kind of meditation, you will learn to be calm and at peace and will not be affected by anything around you, be it a comrade's death, your own limbs cut off, or any shit talks that your enemy will throw at you. In this mode, we'll call it 'Battle Mode' from now on, you will be fully concentrated on your goals and everything that is required to achieve them. There is no obstruction in this mode, only you, your objectives, and any blocks that stops you from achieving your objective. This is the hardest to achieve, since it means that it requires you to be extremely calm, both from the inside and outside during the heat of battle, ignoring everything around you while at the same time, by using your perception, knowing everything around you. It is a state of contradiction, a state of ultimate calmness and the mental state of the ultimate warrior. Think you can achieve this, Naruto?"</B></P><P>"Hell yeah! That sounds extremely cool! I will succeed in this trick I no time, believe it!"</P><P>"<B>*chuckles* Then sit down on the ground in said 'funky pose' first and try to meditate. Only by mastering this you can take it to the next level, the 'Battle Mode'. But for now, just try to meditate and enter your mindscape to meet me."</B></P><P>"Meet you? But I thought that only you can pull me into my mindscape."</P><P>"<B>That is not true actually. That is just me pulling you in via brute force. This is not actually a good option, though there's no side effect for that method. Now I want you to try reaching me on your own. By doing it yourself, you can have more control over the mindscape."</B></P><P>"Okay Kurumi-chan. I'll try to do so."</P><P>After that, he sat down and tried to clear his mind, except that he found out that he can't, and that there's just too many crap flying around in his four year old mind for him to not think of. Seeing her host having a hard time meditating, what with his mind and all, Kurumi decided to give him some extra tips.</P><P>"<B>Naruto, remember this. A mind is like a butterfly. It rests on a flower, but sooner or later, it will fly again. But later, no matter how, it will reach that flower again. And take off. Again and again this cycle repeats. You must not prevent the butterfly from leaving, for the nature of the butterfly is to fly. Try to think about this, and then you will be able to meditate to your heart's content."</B></P><P>"What is this talk about flowers and butterflies? I don't understand!" Naruto whines.</P><P>"<B>*giggles* It is not fun if I gave you the answer directly, and it will not move your mind to its maximum if I were to just gae you all the answers to life, won't it?"</B></P><P>Naruto grumbles, but sat down and thought about it. The more he thought about it, the more he didn't understand a damn thing. Butterflies? Flowers? Flying? What the hell does all those have to do about meditation? The only thing that he knows about meditation is that he sits down in a 'funky pose', then clears his mind. But every time he tries to clear his mind, he always kept thinking of something. When he tries not to think about something, he kept having thoughts. About his future life, his bloodline, trying to get Kurumi out of the seal, and others. And an hour passed, and he still couldn't meditate to save his life. And so, the next session, which was his favourite session, the hunting and eating section for stealth, starts.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>And so he tracked a deer trotting around, probably too old for his pack, and is left to die alone, such is the rules of nature. To put a long story short, he managed to catch the deer, though it fought wildly, but a powerful jab from Naruto to his head silenced him immediately. While he is carrying the deer to the clearing, Kurumi decided to talk to him about his stealth training.</P><P>"<B>Naruto, you need to up the ante of your stealth training. Keep chasing animals is good and all, but compared to ninjas, they might as well be toddlers. I suggest that you either ask for an ANBU to help you with your training again, this time without any hitting or punching, strictly stealth, both jutsu and non-jutsu related, as long as it is stealth. For now, we have to make do with hunting animals, though we will need a new, much better target than usual soon enough, if we want to improve your stealth skill. Not just a target, but also a hunter to 'hunt' you, to force you to improve your stealth."</B></P><P>Not saying anything, Naruto sent a mental nod to her, and keep carrying the deer to the grounds, to skin and eat later on. He had started to get used to eating animals raw, though thinking of eating an enemy's brain, even if it's the enemy's, still brought some form of queasiness to him. After eating the whole deer, down to the bones, in two hours, he started to further track down some other animals in the area to improve his tracking capabilities. Around an hour later, his next session starts, the studying part.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>"Kurumi-chan, what will I be studying in? In jutsu theories? In seals?"</P><P>"<B>All those, and more. You will learn of the world's history from my eyes, the life of Uzumaki Mito, your mom's life, your dad's Hashirama's, Konoha's history, advanced maths, and a lot more. Now dispel all your clones, and make about 20 clones. Each of these clones will learn different things, while you will create even more clones to create and practice seals, so that you know how to create them, even in the midst of battle. Now go ahead and create all those clones."</B></P><P>Naruto complied, and made about 20 clones, while the rest prepares the calligraphy set that Sandaime gave him early in the day and started creating all the seals that he knows and tries to get the speed of writing up, so that he won't be hindered in battle by his mediocre seal writing abilities. The clones that are currently learning history and maths and a whole host of other stuff all had their face scrunched in boredom. Studying, except if it's on jutsu theory and seals, was definitely not Naruto's forte. But after two hours, the day has begun again, and Naruto will start to spar again with the ANBUs, with the Sandaime watching. All this will repeat again and again and again for a whole year, after which Naruto will be leaving the village, and travel around to see the sights of the Elemental Nations.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>TIMESKIP ONE YEAR LATER...</P><P>Naruto, now five years old, but 5' 9" tall, with muscles taut as an executioner's rope, harder than logs, and sky blue eyes that seem to pierce the souls of anyone that he looks at, wearing a black T-shirt with orange lining and black pants with orange lining at the sides, together with an orange jumpsuit with the Uzumaki spiral proudly displayed at its back, is getting ready to leave the town, being led out by the Sandaime himself. Since he had isolated himself for a year after his attacks, lots of the villagers thought that he is either dead, missing or just gone. This makes his life when walking around the town a hassle, since people kept confusing him with his father, with some people thought that the Yondaime had come back to life, which some says that it is because someone sacrificed the life of the 'demon brat' at an altar somewhere to revive him. The girls all looked at him with giggles, both perverted and not, on their mouth, and hearts in their eyes, and some even outright drooled, which honestly scared the crap out of Naruto, seeing that he never got anyone's attention, but the bad kind.</P><P>He has improved massively in almost every aspect. His chakra control is extremely good, especially with his Linker Core assisting it, he learned the leaf exercise in a week, the tree climbing exercise in two weeks and the water walking exercise in a month. He also combined the exercises together, sparring on top of water while being covered with leaves (AN: imagine a sniper's ghillie suit made entirely of leaves) for hours. His stamina and fighting capability has sent multitudes of ANBUs into the hospital due to either chakra exhaustion, or massive damages, both internal and external. So much so, that sparring with Naruto is considered a B-rank mission, paid by the Sandaime himself and is usually the first mission done by new ANBU recruits, and is extremely dreaded by the entire ANBU force.</P><P>His Chakra Armour, at first just a fluke of an idea that came during an attack, now has become a full fledged armour that can only be used by someone who has a huge chakra, and is completely impervious to any regular attacks and any jutsu below B-rank, and some A-rankers as well. The only way to completely go through the attack is to either use wind-natured chakra, though the wound will heal in minutes at worst, thus making any attacks that can go through the Chakra Armour, which is now always unconsciously active, null. Also, he found out that by instead of shrouding himself with it like he did at first, forming the armour just underneath the skin is best, in that even sensors cannot detect the chakra used since it still remains within his body, but also provides an ultimate protection against nearly any attacks just as well.</P><P>His taijutsu has also improved massively. He has mastered the Whirlpool Fist, and combining that with his mastery in seals and the studies he did to improve his sealing abilities and his chakra control, he is able to create seals using just his own chakra and places them on an enemy when he grapples with them, making him an insanely strong taijutsu master which can disable you with one touch of a hand or finger.</P><P>Though what probably shocked both him and Kurumi were his meditation capabilities. After about a month of worthless sitting down which later changes into a sleeping session, he realises something about the analogy of flowers and butterflies...</P><P>*FLASHBACK A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO*</P><P>Naruto is fed up with his own head. Every time he tries clearing his mind his thoughts went everywhere!</P><P>"Dammit, what am I doing wrong?! I sat in The Pose, I tried clearing my mind, yet everything just flew from me! My thoughts kept flying and flying and flying! Sure they will leave me eventually, but. It didn't want to... Wait a minute... I think that's what Kurumi-chan meant by that butterflies and flowers thing! It's not that I must stop it, I must let it fly, and let it come back naturally!"</P><P>With that thought in mind, Naruto, who is already in The Pose, didn't clear his mind. Instead, he let all his thoughts flew, yet he took solace in the action, not suppressing it, not stopping it. After about 1 hour 30 minutes of doing so, he managed to still himself enough, and suddenly felt a pull from his stomach, before he opened his eyes, and found out that he's already in front of Kurumi-chan's cage, as always, knee deep in the sewage water.</P><P>"<B>Ah, good, good! You have managed to find the secret of meditation! It's not to stop the thoughts, it's to let it fly, yet not do anything to push it even more! Now that is the start of meditation, yet it still took too long for you to reach here. You must try to improve."</B></P><P>"Yay!" Naruto cried, and latched himself to Kurumi's furry legs. Kurumi, shocked, asked Naruto, <B>"What are you doing?"</B></P><P>"Feeling your fur! They are very soft, I feel like I can sleep on them! I think that's just what I will do!"</P><P>A blush erupted on Kurumi's face. No one has ever said that her fur is soft, even more slept on them since father died. She was about to say something, when she saw that Naruto is already asleep, though she made herself comfortable, and started sleeping as well. She is tired as well, teaching this orange ball of energy is a hellish job, she thought.</P><P>*FLASHBACK ENDS*</P><P>Since that, every meditation session, Naruto has improved by leaps and bounds, now just requiring a second or two to enter his mindscape for any reason. He has been using that to just chat with Kurumi, hugged her, slept on her awesomely soft fur, and even playing with her. Remembering these actions made him blush for some reason which he didn't know. Or didn't realise. He then tried to apply the meditation concept in combat during the spars, to try and enter his so called 'Battle Mode', yet he failed, and he got his ass kicked during that most of the time. Kurumi-chan said that for that to happen, he must master his skills to a level that everything that he did is instinctive, without further thought, just reflexes and sheer muscle memory. Even if his battle capabilities are pretty good, he still won't consider himself good as long as he didn't manage to unlock 'Battle Mode'.</P><P>His stealth capabilities are just plain astonishing. Even with his height, most of the ANBUs that trained with him cannot catch him, and thanks to his senses, when they tried to hide from him, he can still see them, and if they used jutsu, his eyes saw the chakra that they used, exposing them immediately. Any genjutsu are dispelled immediately, causing them to be unable to hide in a genjutsu, and reveals their position immediately. Any attacks, hidden or not are countered and found out, due to his sharp hearing and his capability to go for days without sleep. He also trained with the ANBUs and Kurumi on the usage, maintenance and repair of basic weapons like kunai and shuriken so that when the condition needs it, he won't be left with any weapons choice at all.</P><P>His studies, although is his weakest part, is enough to pass the academy, and that's it, unless if it involves jutsu theory and seals. His jutsu theory knowledge are off the roof, and his seals are better than anyone in and outside the village, since Kurumi can be considered a seal master, being taught by not one, not two, but three of them, Uzumaki Mito, Uzumaki Kushina and Namikaze Minato themselves. With all this, Kurumi even taught him both Hiraishin and Rasengan, which caused the old man Sandaime to almost went into a heart attack when he saw them.</P><P>Now, fully equipped with weapons like Hiraishin kunai, shuriken, wires, camping gear, and all the other crap that he thought would be needed, all stored within his jacket and seals tattooed on his arms, he stood in front of the great gates of Konoha, and readies himself to leave Konoha for four to five years on an adventure across the Elemental Nations, equipped with some gear with no contacts at all, no information and no fried, except for the bijuu sealed in his stomach, which gave him a fuzzy feeling when he thought of her.</P><P>With the Sandaime at his side, he almost left, before he is stopped by the Sandaime, grabbing his shoulder, and pulled him into a hug.</P><P>"Be safe, Naruto. Know that you are somewhat like a grandson to me, and if there is any problem that you encounter that you cannot... 'solve' on your own, just tell me, and I will be glad to help. Never fear Naruto. While I'm here, you can ask me for help. This will probably be the last time I see you in four years, so indulge this old man with this one hug."</P><P>Naruto, almost crying, replied "No problem, old man. I will be sure to keep myself safe, and after four years, it'll seem like I never left. I will always remember you Jiji, and know that Kurumi also thanked you for everything that you have done for us before, now and forever. But before I leave, have this."</P><P>Naruto hands the Sandaime one of his tri-pronged Hiraishin kunai, which the Sandaime responds by asking "Won't you need these in your journeys? A loss of one weapon in an unfortunate time might just cost you your life you know."</P><P>"Don't worry old man. I have hundreds more where that came from. And I can even make new ones in my journey, no problem. I might even learn smithing and other stuff, just for the hell of it."</P><P>"Naruto, please remember that during your journeys, you will undoubtedly found yourself facing the dark side of the world. There are a lot of things that for most, they are better left unknown, but for us ninjas and for those like you who inspired to be one, things like rape, murder, assassinations, and many others will be something that they will undoubtedly encounter, so please, during such an encounter, please, do not lose your essence, what makes you, you. Because if you do, I'm afraid that in your short life, you won't know love, and only will know hatred, rage and despair, just what the Sage of Six Paths wanted to avoid. "</P><P>"Don't worry Jiji, I will always remember the love that both you and Kurumi-chan showed me (at this, Kurumi blushed horribly), and will be the guide for me to base all my actions on, and I will remove hatred from this world, and I shall create peace. So for the time being, keep the seat warm for me, old man! I will surpass you, and you will have no choice but to make me Hokage!" and with that and a hand wave, Naruto starts to walk past the gates, out of Konoha, and out of sight.</P><P>An ANBU escort appeared beside Sandaime, looked at Naruto's disappearing back, and said "That kid will go far, I'm sure."</P><P>Sandaime nodded, and said "True. True that. I have never denied that. In fact, I'm sure he'll achieve his dream. He has stamped his position on everyone's heart, and I'm sure that given a couple of years, he'll be a great Hokage. But for now, we all have jobs to do, and life must be continued as normal."</P><P>The ANBU nodded and went back to his position while Sandaime walked back to the Hokage Tower while crying anime tears, thinking of the massive amount of paperwork backlogs that he has to encounter back at his office.</P><P>-CHAPTER ENDS-</P><P>So how was that? This is the longest chapter that I have ever written and I think that it's one hell of a training that he went through. What do you guys/gals think? Read and review please! Oh, and thank Charles Bhepin for the idea on the flower and butterfly analogy for the meditation. Go and read his Shinji and Warhammer 40k, it's an extremely awesome fic. Read and review, once again, I cry for you!</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p>Now here comes the third chapter to A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel! Damn this chap came fast by my standards! An early warning though, there is a lemon in this chapter, and it's my first lemon too, so please don't flame me too much for it. So, go ahead and read this chap!</p><p>CHAPTER 3: FIRST TRAVEL YEAR!</p><p>-CHAPTER START-</p><p>Naruto is walking away from Konoha for the last 30 minutes while planning his travel path. "Let's see... I don't think I can travel to Iwa without the people there immediately trying to kill me, because I looked too similar to father, which is good sometimes, but sucks most of the time. I think I'll go to Suna first, passing through River Country, then I'll head north to Earth Country, but won't go to Iwa, instead, went around it, and then enter Taki. Then I'll think further. Now, onwards!"</p><p>So, plans made up, Naruto went on the direction of River Country to the west of Fire Country. But then, Kurumi piped up from his mind.</p><p>"<b>Naruto, travelling to see the world is good and all, but you must remember that one of the main reasons for this trip is to train you. So, we'll break camp every evening, and you must place chakra suppression seals and anti detection seals over the perimeter of the camp so that we can train in peace. But make sure the area is large enough, we don't want your clones to end up in a tight place."</b></p><p>"Sure thing Kurumi-chan. Now I'll continue walking." With his bloodline's capabilities, he didn't so much as walked, as ran full speed towards River Country, with nothing but everything that he has on him in his seals. Not to mention, to further train both his speed and muscles, he had auto adjusting resistance and gravity seals placed on him. The seals auto adjusts in that once they detected that the user has already exceeded the seals' resistance, they will increase themselves automatically without requiring any physical adjustments from the outside. So, his journeys also help improve his speed and strength.</p><p>Naruto was running around the path to a nearby town, when he heard a scream coming from the path ahead. He immediately disabled the resistance and gravity seals and dashed forward towards the source of the screams. What he saw made his blood ran cold. A trade caravan, with all the caravan members tied up, with some of them dead, their decapitated heads mounted on pikes along the roads. Naruto's eyes saw that there are around fifty highwaymen, three heads on pikes with their bodies not far away, ten tied people, screaming and crying, and what angered both him and Kurumi the most: a girl, not older than fifteen, about to be raped by three bandits.</p><p>"<b>NARUTO-KUN! KILL THEM ALL! DO NOT LET THEM SURVIVE! THEY TRIED TO FORCE THEMSELVES ON THE GIRL! DO NOT LET THEM! KILL THEM ALL!" </b>The change of honorific went unrealised by both of them, with Naruto, focusing only on saving the girl and Kurumi, focusing on preventing said heinous act from happening. Naruto immediately dashed forward at blinding speed, faster than what most people can see, and faster than even some jounins and reached directly in the middle of the three would-be rapists, who was in the process of tearing off the girl's clothes. Naruto suddenly became calmer in his extreme rage, with the only thought running in his mind is to save the girl and annihilate the bandits.</p><p>Without even thinking, Naruto immediately grabbed the bandit that was tearing the girl's clothes, pulled him away and punched him right on the chest, with a punch so powerful that the man's chest was instantly pulverized with some of his rib bones protruding from his back. He then grabbed the other bandit and ripped his hand off of his body, blood spraying on his and Naruto's body, before Naruto using that arm to beat the third bandit with one swing that was so hard that the bandit flew away, and getting knocked out on a tree, head bleeding, while the arm was smashed to pieces. All this occurred in ten seconds, such is Naruto's speed.</p><p>The rest of the bandits, who previously was busy cheering their compatriots who are about to rape the girl, deicided that they have numbers on their side, and immediately charged Naruto, bellowing war cries and shouts of vengeance. Naruto, still in his rage-empowered 'Battle Mode', disappeared from their sights and appeared in their midst, and the carnage starts. Using his bare hands, Naruto ripped the head off from a bandit nearby, throwing both the body and the head onto a different bandit, blood showering from the body. Another bandit had his chest pierced by Naruto's empty hand, his heart immediately destroyed, another took a literal ball-crushing kick, a roundhouse kick from Naruto snapped the neck of another, sending him flying into another bandit. One bandit's spear got shoved into his own head through the bottom of the head, sending brain matter everywhere. Another's sword was used by Naruto to decapitate three bandits before the sword itself broke due to low maintenance. Naruto was death incarnate, whirling in the midst of the bandits like a tornado, killing, dismembering, decapitating, all with his bare hands.</p><p>By the end of the very short, three minute battle, all the bandits are dead in extremely gruesome ways, with Naruto himself showered in blood, though the self cleaning seals within his clothes will take care of it later. Then Naruto broke out of his trance, and saw the carnage that he caused. He immediately puked, and fainted, and ended up in his mindscape, right in front of Kurumi's cage. Wanting some comfort, he ran, tears flowing from his face, into the awaiting arm of Kurumi.</p><p>"Kurumi-chan! *sniff* I killed them all! In brutal ways! *sniff* I feel bad, yet I can't help but think that that's good! Why am I feeling this?! WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY!?" Naruto cried, his tears didn't stop flowing.</p><p>"<b>Naru-kun, don't worry. What you did, as bad as it is, are for a good cause. They are going to rape the girl, then either kill them or force them to become their sex slaves, not being able to escape, unless they died. They might also kill the rest of the people or use them as hostages, or just torture them for fun. In my long life, humans are a very chaotic creature, in that their nature themselves are chaotic. Don't worry Naruto-kun. Cry not for them, but cry instead for your lost innocence, one that you won't gain again. Hug me, and cry on me. I'm here, and not planning on leaving any time soon. I will always be with you, don't forget that. You are mine, and I am yours, as it is so."</b></p><p>Naruto kept crying, and crying, and crying, his Astartes bloodline not allowing him the reprieve of dreamless sleep. After a pretty long while in his mindscape, he stopped crying, and asked Kurumi. "Kurumi-chan, am I a bad person? I didn't feel anything when I killed them. I regretted doing so, but during the battle, I didn't feel anything, only that I must save the girl and kill all the bandits. Does that make me bad?"</p><p>"<b>No Naruto-kun, in fact, if you didn't regret killing them, then you are a bad person. The reason why you didn't feel anything is that you managed to enter your 'Battle Mode', though the only reason you can do so is due to extreme anger. We must train you some more so that you can use it without any external stimulations. No Naruto. If you didn't regret killing them, but instead find enjoyment in doing so, then you are a bad person. In the work of a ninja, killing is not just unavoidable, but necessary. Sometimes you will be ordered to poison someone, sometimes just killing them by any means, sometimes you even need to frame someone else for a kill that you did, but know that it is necessary. But learn to deal with them, and never let go of the regret and the feeling that it gives, for if you do, then you are no longer a proper human. No matter what, a life is precious, and any kills is a bad thing. But the act is necessary, it's just that whether you regret doing it or not that will determine your humanity."</b></p><p>"Thanks Kurumi-chan. I needed that. I think that was my first kill. And that hits hard. Anyway, I promise that I will visit you here more often. For now, I need to wake up and check the conditions of the rest of the people. See ya!" And with that, he was gone from the mindscape, which caused Kurumi to think about what she said to him before, and blushed horribly.</p><p>"<i><b>I called him Naruto-kun! And I said that he is mine! And I am his! Did he even realise that? I doubt that, he is too busy wallowing in his first kill to recognize or remember what I just said. But what I said is true, and I will still consider it true, and even if he remembers and asked me about it, then I will say it to him: I am falling in love with him, and I hope that he does to me as well."</b></i></p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Waking up from his fainting spell, he found out that he was cleaned by the people of the caravan, before he heard a shout of "He's awake!" from his right. He stood up and saw that all of the people, the surviving ones, all came at him. A guy with short hair and a round, chubby face in a pretty expensive kimono greeted him.</p><p>"Greetings, sir...?"</p><p>"...Arashi." Naruto decided to not tell him his real name, in case it might cause him to become known later on. He wished to keep a low profile, after all.</p><p>"Ah, Arashi-san. We are extremely grateful for you for saving us from the bandit attack just now. You fainted in the pool of your own vomit with your body covered with blood, so we cleaned you up, though for some reason your clothes clean themselves up suddenly."</p><p>"...Thanks. May I have your name? And what about the girl just now?"</p><p>"My name is Kanda, and the girl you just saved is my daughter, Kanade-chan. No words can express my thanks to you."</p><p>"You don't need to. Any decent human would do something about them."<br><b>"Naru-kun, ask them where the bodies of the bandits are." </b>Kurumi quipped.</p><p>"<i>What for?"</i></p><p>"<b>For you to eat their brains. Before you started screaming at me about eating someone's brains, remember that the Omophagea organ allows you to gain their knowledge and their memories, thus allowing you to find the location of their main camp, and either rescue any captives that they have, or eliminate them all, or both. For them to attack such a caravan, there must be more of them around, and a bandit camp of that size must've been there for a while, and there must be lots of people that they have captured. So it's better to clear off all of them, these scum."</b></p><p>Naruto, although disgusted, agreed with Kurumi, and asked Kanda where the bodies of the bandits are. After locating the bodies and identifying the one that seems like the leader, Naruto took out one of his Hiraishin kunai, and carved the bandit's head, which luckily survived, because he only got his heart destroyed with a powerful punch, or at least that's what the damage to the bandit leader's body seems to say. After removing the skull and picking up the guy's brain, with extreme disgust Naruto chews the brain of the leader and swallows it. After a couple of minutes, Naruto was assaulted with a headache so powerful it makes him fall to his knees, and grabs his head, before a bunch of memories from the bandit appeared in his mind (AN: Think of how Alex Mercer and James Heller after they consumed a Web of Intrigue target. This will keep happening throughout the story, and the comparison seemed most apt.). He didn't just found out the location of the bandit camp, but also their leader, who is a missing nin from Kiri, and the unspeakably heinous and inhumane acts that they did to their prisoners, with selling them to the highest bidder being one of the most humane thing that they did.</p><p>Naruto, now pissed off beyond all reason, went back to Kanda, and told him to stay put and break camp on their current location, before making a couple of Kage Bunshins and sent them to various parts of the camp so that they will be covered while he's gone. Then, he dashed immediately to the bandit camp, which was located about 2 days' journey from the survivor's camp on a civilian pace, 12 hour's journey by genins, and about an hour by Naruto at max speed, which he did.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>As he reached the outskirts of the camp, he uses his superior eyesight to see what is going on within the camp. His ears picked up the sound of people screaming and begging for mercy, his eyes saw a huge bonfire, surrounded by the bandits, and his nose picked up the smell of death, fire, ruins and flesh.</p><p>"<i>So, how shall we do this? Chakra or no chakra?"</i></p><p>"<b>Chakra. The easiest way is to use the Hiraishin Rain kunai and flash to all of them, killing them while doing so. Easy, less collateral damage, and pretty silent, though not exactly hidden. The flash will be visible, but as long as you went fast enough, I doubt that they can even stop you."</b></p><p>Agreeing with the strategy, Naruto sent a mental nod to her and took out one of his most special kunai, the Hiraishin Rain (HR) kunai. This kunai did not just have a Hiraishin seal on it. It also contains a force seal<b>, </b>a seal that sends a wave of force to everything around it, which is essentially a reuseable, low powered exploding tag, and a storage seal, which contains hundreds, or tens of Hiraishin kunai, depending on what condition that it needs to be used for, anti army or just anti camp. They also have recall seals that can recall all the Hiraishin kunai into their respective HR kunai storage seal, making retrieval easy. By throwing a HR kunai on top of an enemy camp or an army formation, the tens or hundreds of kunai can be rained down on the enemy, hence the name, and Naruto can Hiraishin to every single one of them, thus making him capable of taking down an entire army or enemy camp alone, without any help. At least theoretically. This is going to be the first combat test for the HR kunai.</p><p>Naruto prepares the HR kunai while dropping a single Hiraishin kunai at his current location as a fallback point, and launches the HR kunai high up over the bandit camp. The wave of force and the kunai are immediately scattered in the camp, some outright hitting some of the bandit. They never knew what hit them. One moment they're all chatting and talking merrily, the next a bunch of weird looking kunai was flying around the base, injuring, even killing some of them. And the next, the only thing they saw was a yellow flash that appeared almost everywhere, and then they knew no more.</p><p>Naruto stopped flashing right outside a couple of tents, right after he finished Rasengan-ing the bandits outside, almost three hundred of them. Guess the spirit of Spartans does not live in them, despite their numbers. He opened the flap of a tent, and what he saw there sickens him. A man was busy plunging his dick into a child, probably no more than twelve years old whose lifeless eyes show that she has lost all the will to live, the scent of blood and sex permeates the air in the tent like a cloud of thick, dopey smoke. The man, not realising that Naruto was looking at him, continued with his business, while Naruto, in all his rage and anger, following the orders of Kurumi, came at the guy with deliberate slowness, before stabbing his kunai into the man's crotch.</p><p>"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRGHHH!" The man screamed, before Naruto picked him up by the neck, and ripped off his fingers, one digit at a time with him watching it all the time. After all his fingers are torn off, he ripped the man's dick off before shoving it into his mouth, prematurely silencing the man, literally sucking off his own dick. Naruto then proceeds to tear off the man's jaw off his head, before using his inhuman strength to entirely crush his neck, decapitating him in the most brutal manner. Shivering due to the brutality of his BM kills, he started asking Kurumi on what the man was doing when he came in. The only thing that he understands is that it is bad, he understood it in his soul.</p><p>"<b>Naruto-kun... I guess you are in need of 'The Talk', but we'll do that later. For now, know that what that person does is horrible and evil, and you must stop anyone you encounter in the future that will do such things. But now, we have a bandit camp to clear."</b></p><p>Accepting the dismissal, Naruto created a couple shadow clones to free the women in the tent, exited the tent, and went to search for the leader, but he didn't have to. The leader, a missing nin from Kiri, is already waiting among the dead bandits, and is looking towards Naruto.</p><p>"So... You're the ones who killed all my men... You will p-"</p><p>His words was cut short when Naruto, still in a rage, charged forward at a blinding speed, and smashed his fist into the missing nin's face, breaking his nose and his entire front row teeth. While the nin was flying due to the strength of Naruto's fist-to-the-face, he caught the nin's leg and swung him, head first, to the ground. Multiple times. Then. Naruto tossed him upwards like so much a ragdoll, and grabbed his leg again, pulling him downwards before using a Rasengan on his upper torso, turning his chest into so much man puree. After the man has finished his impromptu Rasengan powered flight, Naruto, with the urgings of Kurumi, ate the nin's brain. After enduring another massive headache, he gained the memories of the nin. Turns out that he was a chuunin level missing nin from Kiri, and ran away from Kiri due to the fact that he was disappointed with the power that he gained while at Kiri. He also gained the knowledge of the terrain within Kiri, the condition of Kiri, his jutsus and some other unrelated stuff. Naruto looked back at the carnage that he did within the camp, and sees the girls and women that was freed.</p><p>"Hello everyone. For now we will hold first with the introductions. Me and my clones will bring all of you to a caravan nearby which I also saved. So come closer."</p><p>Naruto then created some clones that lifted all the people that they rescued onto their shoulders, some which looted the camp, and sprinted straight back to the location of the caravan from before, carrying both people and loot. All in all, the destruction of the camp takes only 12 minutes.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>At the caravan's camp, once the people that Naruto has rescued from the camp, which amounts to around 45 people, has been taken care of by both the people from the caravan and the prisoners that can still perform simple tasks, Kanda went to meet Naruto, who was lying down on a thick branch, seemingly sleeping.</p><p>"Arashi-san, all the people that you brought have been properly tended to. But what should we do now? We didn't have much resource to cater for all these people for long."</p><p>"Then I guess we'll just take them to the village that you're about to travel to before the bandits attacked. How about that?"</p><p>"Then I guess that we have a plan of action now. Notify everyone that we'll move tomorrow. I'll create more clones to carry everyone and seal your items inside scrolls. Now I will be training, so don't bother me unless it's really important," Naruto said to Kanda, who then went to relay the information to everyone, and Naruto, who created more clones to watch the camp, which had an air of happiness around it, and went to create his training grounds with many seals as its borders.</p><p>"<b>Alright Naruto-kun. From what we know about your elemental nature that we tested before we left, you have Wind, Fire and Water nature. So, you need to make about three thousand clones, a thousand for each type of elemental training, around five hundred more for taijutsu training, around five hundred more for seals studies, while you yourself will sit somewhere, and listen to me."</b></p><p>Shrugging, Naruto made the required number of clones and told them to do what their Kurumi-clones told them to do, while Naruto decides to get comfortable and sat down in a lotus position and went into his mindscape to talk to his Kurumi-chan.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Naruto's mindscape, which was a sewer before, is now a lush meadow as far as the eye can see, with a single huge tree in the middle, which acts like a home for Kurumi to stay. Kurumi, who is now lying down on the grass, and has a collar with a cracked ruby that has the kanji for seal written inside of it, calls Naruto to come towards her, which he did so and starts to climb her back and lied on her soft, furry back.</p><p>"<b>Naruto... Do you know what the person just now is doing?"</b></p><p>"Yes, he is using his penis and puts inside that girl's... parts, but what? Or why? And that girl... why did she looks like that? It pains me to see her like that..."</p><p>"<b>Naruto-kun, it's time you learned The Talk. After that, then you will understand why the act you just saw is extremely vile, and must not be done, no matter what. Naruto-kun, when a man loves a woman,..."</b></p><p>And among the extremely emotionally depressed Naruto and the thousands of year old bijuu occurs an event known by most only as The Talk, where Naruto learns of sex, sexuality and its effects... which will change Naruto into one of the world's most powerful anti-rapist. Two hours later, and The Talk, as awkward a condition as it is ever given in, is finally over. Blushing heavily, Naruto started to ask Kurumi about the man just now.</p><p>"So that means, what the man was doing, is that he forced himself on that girl, and that that girl is already too depressed and has lost the will to live...?"</p><p>"<b>Essentially, yeah. But I can't say that for sure, though that seems about right."</b></p><p>"Then here and now I will make an oath, witnessed by you, Kurumi-chan. I will kill, without mercy, any rapist that I encounter, especially if they are currently within the act, and I will torture them first, and make them pay. They will pay, I promise. Any rapist had better beware, because Uzumaki Naruto is here, and he tolerates no rapist! NO ONE!"</p><p>"<b>Then here I, Kurumi, daughter of the Sage of Six Paths, the Nine-Tailed Bijuu, bear witness to the oath of one Uzumaki Naruto, my future mate, to not give any quarter to any rapist. So shall the oath be, and so shall it stay, until the end of time."</b></p><p>After calming himself down, Naruto asks "So what am I supposed to train in now?"</p><p>"<b>You must train further in trying to unlock the BM. Currently, the BM is only unlocked in moments of extreme rage and anger. By being able to utilise this skill to its maximum at any time, you can battle anyone and anything at your maximum capability, without any blocks, both mental and physical. Now, you must try meditating during battle for this mode to happen. Also, once your clones managed to properly perform their respective elemental exercises, then I will start to teach you jutsu."</b></p><p>Nodding, Naruto continued his training under the guidance of Kurumi, while his clones are busy doing elemental chakra composition training. After a couple of hours, daybreak came without any incidents, and Naruto dispelled all his clones, and learned that some of them have finished their respective exercises. To test this, he grabbed a leaf from a nearby tree, and managed to cut it using nothing but wind chakra, grabbing two other leaf, he tried flowing fire chakra and earth chakra to each leaf, and one burned while the other crumbled, signalling the complete success of the exercises last night. Then, Naruto went to Kanba's location, and told him to rally everyone and gather all their belongings, where he will seal them in scrolls while he'll create massive amount of clones to carry everyone to the town nearby. After around half an hour, all the people, about sixty of them and all the items are gathered in one location. Naruto immediately took out an empty scroll and created a mass storage scroll, designed to carry multiple items of multiple types all in just one scroll. Then, as he said earlier, Naruto created clones, one for each person so they can carry them to a nearby town, though the kid, which he saved while she's being raped, is still lifeless, and doing everything robotically. Her dull eyes, her actions and even her very chakra, to Naruto, screams 'suicidal'.</p><p>"Kanda-san, where is the closest town to our current location? A map is not something that I have, thus I will need you to tell me the location of the closest town. I am unable to do much to all of you, and can only carry all of you to that town, then you all will have to decide what should you do."</p><p>"Nonsense, Arashi-san. You have done enough for all of us, and I am glad that we found someone like you that helped us. Now let's see... The closest town to our current location is the town of Shizuka, still within the borders of Fire Country, so most probably we'll be safe there. It's around a day's journey to the town, and it's around north north east of our current position."</p><p>"Alright Kanda-san. Everyone! Hold on to your clones tight! I will be running very fast to get us there in no time!"</p><p>And run they did. Clones of Naruto ran faster than anything the people had ever known, through the beaten path, through the forest, and even on a river that crosses their path, the people he carried all screaming in excitement and some in fear, they even forgotten their capture and subsequent torture and life at the hands of those bandits, except for the kid, who was hanging on to the real Naruto lifelessly, not making any sounds, and not even so much as looked elsewhere. Looking at this, Naruto frowned, though there is not much that he could do, not at this time.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>In just 4 hours of non-stop running and/or tree-hopping, they have reached the town of Shizuka, which was a small, peaceful town, though there are not many people there. He places all the people that he carried on the ground close to the town and told them to walk back to the town, some of them falling down due to lack of use for their legs. Some of them are even hugging him in happiness, saying that Shizuka is the town where they came from, while the rest will have to look for some other method of transportation to get back to where they're from. The girl didn't make a sound, none at all. Naruto frowned, but before he could say anything, Kurumi said within his mind.</p><p>"<b>Naruto, some people are just too late to be saved. In life, that is one of the facts, that as hard as it is for us to accept, is still a fact of life. You can also never save everyone, either from anyone else, or from themselves. No matter how much you fought against this fact, the truth is, sometimes, it is better not saving some people that didn't want to be saved and focus on saving those that want to rather than trying to save everyone at the same time. It is a morbid thought, but an undeniable one nonetheless."</b></p><p>Naruto tried to accept this fact, oh he tried, but he just cannot accept this one simple fact of life. Due to that, he tried everything he can to cheer up the girl, but nothing worked. But then, when he was taking the girl to the centre of the town, a pair of husband and wife ran at him, screaming.</p><p>"Hana! Oh, my Hana! You're safe! Oh Hana!" cried the woman, who hugged the girl tightly, tears of joy falling out of her eyes like a waterfall. After a while, the husband joins in, together crying, but the girl, now known as Hana, still didn't make a sound. Until she somehow moved her head, looked at her family, and cried, the tears held back for who knows how long finally pouring out of her eyes without restraint and without any signs of stopping, while hugging her mother as tight as possible. Naruto, watching this scene, turns back and tried to walk away, before he heard someone calling him.</p><p>"Sir, are you the one who saved my daughter?" asked the man.</p><p>"...Yes, though I won't count her as saved, not as of yet. She will be in a very hard life, and you'd better remember that she's been in a lot of pain, probably more pain than any other person her age should go through. She is very badly broken, and I fear for her mind. Please love her until her end, and hope that you can heal her of her mental scars."</p><p>"...I may not want to know this, but what was happening to her when you found her that made you speak of such things?"</p><p>"...When I met her, she was being raped by a bandit in a camp." At this, the father's face paled. "I know not how long has that been continuing, but I immediately killed the man, in a most brutal and horrifying manner, and so do I cleared the whole camp. Consider that as a minor form of revenge that I can give out for your child."</p><p>"Thank you so much for saving her, mister...?"</p><p>"Arashi. Call me Arashi, from Konoha."</p><p>"Arashi-san from Konoha. No words can express how much is my feelings of gratitude towards you for saving my daughter. She is my only daughter, the sun of our lives."</p><p>"Do not thank me for what a decent man should do. Instead, you can thank me by taking good care of your daughter, and make sure something like that never happens again."</p><p>"I will take your advice, Arashi-san. Please stay in my house for a day before you continue on your trip. From your clothes, I'd say that you are a traveller."</p><p>"Thanks, but I do not think so. I will continue on through my journey, and will leave you. Do not feel as you owed me anything, for an act a good man would do. Anyway, I will take leave now, and may many blessings fall on your family after this catastrophic disaster. Farewell." With that, Naruto turned away and walked from the family, thankful that the girl has managed to cry out her pains on the shoulders of her family. The wife then asked the husband.</p><p>"Dear, who is that man? Did you get his name?" while still rubbing the back of their crying daughter.</p><p>"His name is arashi, from Konoha. And he didn't want anything from us. He just saved our daughter from a fate worse than death, and he asked for nothing. I have, and probably never will, meet any person more honourable than him."</p><p>They both then sat in silence, one hugging their still crying daughter, and one watching the back of the man that saved their beloved daughter. Unknown to all four of them, the girl gets pregnant later on due to the raping that she endured, and gave birth to a baby boy that she named after her saviour, Arashi, who was cared for by the whole family and made sure that the boy is loved, and not hated.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Naruto then walked back to where he left the rest of the caravan and the people that he rescued, and talked to Kanba about his caravan.</p><p>"Kanba-san, so what happens now? You have safely reached the town, and doesn't seem to be able to leave for a while. So, any plans?"</p><p>"None for now Arashi-san. I would like to sell my wares here, and have the carpenters here build me a new caravan, and then continue on my journey to sell my wares. Your kindness will forever be noted Arashi-san, and for that, I thank you."</p><p>"About that, can you help me with something? I'm on a journey, yet when I started, I did not think of having a map for me to use. Can you sell me a map? The loot that I gained during my raid on the camp didn't get me a map, <i>though I did get a copy of Kiri's bingo book.</i>" He added the last part in his mind.</p><p>"Of course! I will gladly give it away to you, as thanks for saving us! Though it is not much-"</p><p>"Don't worry. That is enough. I don't think I need anymore. Now I will take my leave from this town, and continue on my journey."</p><p>Truning around, Naruto then walked away from the caravan, and walked away from the town, and out of everyone's sight, before tree hopping to another destination, one that no one knows.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>After his stop in Shizuka, Naruto continued his training journey,travelling for 12 hours and training for another 12, and resting only on the weekend in an 8-hour sleep, with which he continued to visit Kurumi, to talk, to chat, and even just to sleep on her. Along his journey, he trained himself in various elemental jutsu, completed all his elemental training, and even improved his Shadow clones so much so that he didn't even need handsigns for them. Massive number of clones trained everyday in taijutsu, elemental recomposition and seals, even trained in elements that are not his main (lightning, earth), while he himself tried to achieve the elusive BM. Days upon days upon days passed without any further troubles, and one day, he found out that towns, cities and certain places had bounty boards, where people places various missions and bounty hunting missions. On the urgings of Kurumi, he decided to pick up some of the missions, mainly bandit exterminations, finding missing person, or even missing nin hunting.</p><p>During the bandit extermination missions, Naruto shows that he really intends to keep his promise. BM or not, he killed the bandits, especially those that he caught raping with extreme brutality. Limbs are torn, bodies mutilated beyond reason, entire camps annihilated. For some of the camps, the prisoners have been sex slaves for so long that it's all they knew, and they've lost hope, so much so that they are not even alive for the most part. In the end, he's forced to mercy-kill these people to end them of their misery. During these moments, Naruto usually gets so angry that not just he started drawing on Kurumi's evil chakra, he absolutely crushes the bandits without any restraints, destroying them utterly, and sometimes not even bodies are left. During these moments, he usually ended up on Kurumi's fur, crying not for his own sake, but for the innocent lives that he was forced to take, due to them being so broken and hopeless.</p><p>Also, another thing that he found different was his feelings towards Kurumi. She is always there, to comfort him, to teach him, to just give him a (massive) hug, to be his friend in need, and to be his greatest confidant. During times when he was sad, like after a mercy kill, Kurumi hugged him in her massive tails, whispering words of comfort and calming him down. During happy times, she celebrates with her, like if he learned a new jutsu. During times of great rage, like when he saw someone trying to kill an innocent or trying to raid an unassuming caravan, she rages together with him. During times of extreme boredom, she is there, telling him stories of her adventure, or just even being someone to chat with. After a certain amount of pondering, he realised something: she is the best life partner that he can have, and would want her to be at his side, until he dies, or until the end of time, and would be at her side as well, come world's end.</p><p>Also, due to Naruto's BM training, he somehow becomes bipolar, for no reason. Most of the time, he is a very happy, very relaxed guy that can make everyone around him laugh, but in battle, he became a ruthless, extremely brutal, cold blooded warrior, whose enemy's blood became his drink, and their flesh his food, sometimes literally. Due to his own constitution, he is able to digest everything that the enemy once was, and which terrifies the remaining enemies to no end. So much so that he is placed within the Bingo Book as Arashi the Blood Drinker, a B-ranked freelance mercenary, whose face was never seen, because he wears a hood, covered with voice changing seals face distortion seals, which helps him keep his identity nickname made him sick with himself at first, until Kurumi reminded him that what he does is for the good of everyone around, depending on the target, which was usually bandits.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Ten months had passed, and right now Naruto is fighting a Konoha missing nin named Rokushou Aoi, who was wielding the Sword of the Thunder God, once owned by Senju Tobirama, against Naruto. His genin team was already wiped out by Naruto earlier, getting their brain matter falling on the ground after a series of vicious right hooks from Naruto killed all of them, with Naruto not even affected by Aoi's Senbon Shower technique with his Chakra Armour activated.</p><p>"Dammit! What are you?! You're not human! No human can punch that hard!"</p><p>Naruto, currently in BM, which he just achieved two weeks ago, rushed to his position immediately and grabbed his wrist, before snapping his entire arm like a twig. Before Aoi could even start screaming, Naruto punched his face hard enough to cave his entire face in and turn it into a huge pile of mush, silencing him immediately, while the Sword of the Thunder God fell to the ground. Wordlessly, he picked it up, sealed it in a scroll, and destroyed the man and his teams' body with a massive Katon jutsu. Then he started to tree hop his way away from Rain Country, and going back to Fire Country.</p><p>"Kurumi-chan, I think I've done most of the bounties available, and I can retrieve his when we get back to Konoha later."</p><p>"<b>Yes Naruto-kun. I think you have cleared everything that you can here in Rain Country, and you have the Raijin with you, though I'm no swordswoman, so I can't teach you anything about it. So what about if we continue our journey around the Elemental Nations?"</b></p><p>"That is a very good idea, but I think I need to get us somewhere isolated first, maybe back to Fire Country for now, before we continue our journey. But first, I have something to say to you. Please listen to me first before you say anything." Said Naruto, with a huge blush on his face, while he stopped at a cave close by, and started preparing his usual compliment of seals to hide his location.</p><p>Kurumi, feeling weird about this one particular thing that Naruto was about to say and why they broke camp much earlier than expected, just sent Naruto a mental nod and lied down on the grassy plains of the mindscape. Feeling the nod, Naruto immediately sat in the lotus position, and immediately appeared in front of Kurumi's snout.</p><p>"Kurumi-chan, I can't help my feelings on this. You have been my most faithful companion, one who has been at my side for either good, or bad. You have been my teacher, teaching me all the things that I did not know, or improved on the things that I do know, and has been my partner ever since I found out about you. You have also been my best friend, sticking with me through thick or thin, I... I don't know what else to say. I... I love you, Kurumi-chan!" Naruto cried, and then grabbed her muzzle, before kissing her gigantic snout.</p><p>Kurumi was shocked. No, she was beyond shocked. There was no way she would have predicted this. She didn't expect him to fell in love with her this early!</p><p>"<b>Naruto-kun... I loved you too. For a long time. Not just because your parents arranged you as my future mate due to your ancestor's promise, but also due to the qualities that you have shown to me about you. You did not kept your innocence, though you still cried for both your enemies and the ones you need to deal a mercy kill to. You also showed that you still retain some manner of chivalry, in that you didn't take assassination missions, which you know that you can handle it without any problems. I loved you, Naruto-kun, not just because of what you are, but also because you are one of the most honourable person that I have ever met, and with my long life, that's saying something. I do not regret taking you as my mate, Naruto-kun, though I still wonder, what made you confess to me, and what made you think you love me?"</b></p><p>"Um... I realised, nowadays, that when I was doing anything, the only thing I can think of is your face, your gentle voice, your fur's soft caress, and... everything about you. So, after pondering about it for a while, I figured out that I must've loved you, since you are the only thing that I can think of in my mind."</p><p>"<b>Naruto-kun..."</b> she cooed, and licked his face, which due to her size, causes him to get flung away from her, and fell somewhere on the lush meadows of his mind.</p><p>"Hey! What's that for?" Naruto shouted, his whole body covered in Kurumi's saliva.</p><p>"<b>Well, you kissed my snout, so I think that the only way to repay that is to lick your face, though I miscalculated the strength of my lick*giggles*."</b></p><p>Naruto just sighed, and went back to her body. "You know, Kurumi-chan, I can never stay mad at you for long. You have done so much for me, and if you want to lick me some more, then go ahead. I won't stop you."</p><p>Kurumi giggled again, a sound that Naruto thought heavenly, and started to chase Naruto to lick his face again. This cute game of cat and mouse between a chakra creature the size of a small mountain and a human continues for a while, before she just said <b>"Fuck this"</b> and whisked Naruto with her tails to her head, and places him there. <b>"Naruto, you should bring us to a location that is somewhere hidden from both friend and enemy. I have accepted you as my mate, and there are just two more things to do before you are considered my true mate."</b></p><p>Naruto nodded, and took out a map, the same map that he got from Kanba, now extremely worn, but containing notes and sketches about locations, new settlements, bandit attacks, and many others. He finally decided on a place, a huge clearing with a cave that he uses once in between Grass Country and Fire Country.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Taking 3 days to get there, Naruto set up the seals, though Kurumi asks that the usual anti detection and repelling seals be enforced with multiple chakra suppression seals that can stop bijuu level chakra from escaping, and that the area for the seal defences must be much larger than the ones he usually places. Confused, but willing to follow the orders of his love, he did just that, made some clones to settle out the area around the cave before entering the cave himself, removed all his clothes, sat in the lotus position and immediately met Kurumi.</p><p>"Kurumi-chan, what do you mean when you said that there are two more things to do before I am considered your true mate?"</p><p>"<b>Father said that for someone to become us bijuu's true mate, you must accept all my power and clear it of its hatred with your love, and become a hanyou (half demon). Only then will the world will be rid of the Juubi completely. The reason why I need the chakra seals placed all around the campsite is so that no one outside would feel the release of chakra, and so that the process can be completed without anybody bothering us."</b></p><p>"I see. So what should I do now to cleanse your power?"</p><p>"<b>Just look into my eyes, and I will send the power into you, with which if your love to me is false, then you will probably die in agony, due to the upsurge of hatred and anger that will come with my powers."</b></p><p>"Then I will do so! I will show you that my love is not fake, and that I will take all your hatred, and cleanses it with my love!" Naruto, ever the hotheaded, headstrong person that he is, looked straight into Kurumi's eyes, not even blinking.</p><p>"<b>*chuckles* Very well Naruto-kun, I will start the power transfer now. Do not stray away from my eyes."</b></p><p>Suddenly, a thick miasma of crimson chakra from Kurumi bubbled around her, and rushed towards Naruto, and suddenly, Naruto felt that he was pulled into another plane of existence, his body felt like it's being crushed and pulled like a piece of freshly made ramen, before he blacked out.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Naruto woke up with a gasp, and saw that he is in a world of pure white. A blinding white as far as the eye can see, which made him felt like he was walking on the ground while watching the sky at the same he suddenly felt a pair of eyes on him, and immediately turned and tried taking out his kunai from the seal on his sleeve, only to realise that he is only wearing a regular white shirt with a pair of pure white pants. As he was puzzling the mysterious disappearance of his clothes, the eyes that he felt on him just now immediately became a body, one with weird horn-shaped hair at his head, purple rippled eyes, a shakujo in hand, and a cloak with black shirt. Turning around, naruto saw this person and gasped, "The Sage of Six Paths!"</p><p>"<b>Correct young one. It seems that many aeons have passed since my time. Tell me, what has happened to the world that I saved, and the teachings that I passed down onto the people?"</b></p><p>"Great Sage, it is with huge regret that I must tell you of the happenings. The world now uses your teachings, known as ninjutsu, not to help each other, but to kill each other. They have also forgotten your teachings, and barbaric people still exists at this moment, and as sad as it is, I fear that I am one of those barbaric person. My hands are stained with blood, both the innocent and the guilty, and no amount of washing can clear my mind of both the guilt and the sin of killing these people, some whom I consider deserves it, while some other which is innocent, but just happened to lost hope on living, causing them to be better off dead. I wished for peace and the end of hatred, and yet what I cause is bloodshed and turmoil."</p><p>The Sage, to Naruto's surprise, chuckled. <b>"You are still young, child. But even so, I can see that your heart is in the right place. Now let us go to the real reason why I am here."</b> Feeling curious about that as well, Naruto listened well to what the Great Sage was about to say. <b>"I actually tore off a part of my soul when I created the bijuu to act as their consciousness, and their part of the soul. That part will later grew to be their own soul each, and will not be able to revive me, not by any means. But, the soul shards has one final function, which is to judge the person that each bijuu chooses to be their mate, and to check whether or not that person is capable of cleaning the hatred of the Juubi from the bijuu's powers, by which if I deem them unworthy, they will immediately die, and their soul be consumed by my soul shard, to empower me to readminister this test to the next person that each bijuu considers their mate. Now, I will test you, your determination, your will and your love towards Kurumi. You don't need to prepare yourself. Just stay there."</b></p><p>Before Naruto can even ask what does the Sage meant by 'just stay there', he is already in front of Naruto, with his hand directly through his chest. Surprisingly, for someone who has their heart punched through by a spectral spirit, he didn't feel any pain, just a feeling of calmness and serenity coursing through him, and as suddenly as the hand went through his chest, the feeling disappeared and the Sage is back in front of him.</p><p>"<b>Your heart is of pure gold child. With what you have been through, you should not even survive the first two years of your life, yet what it only does is that it strengthens your resolution to achieve peace, and to love what can be loved, and hate what can be hated. Your love for Kurumi is also as pure as spring water, and I detect no falsehood coming from your soul itself. And for that, I approve of you as Kurumi's mate. Take care of my daughter well, and pass this to her: I will always love her, whether or not she was being controlled by my descendants. May my words bring peace to her heart."</b></p><p>The sage then appeared in front of Naruto, whispering <b>"Creation of All Things"</b>, and Naruto then suddenly felt that his sheer essence was struck with blinding agony, and then he knew no more.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>At the real world, Naruto's body, which was naked and in the lotus position, suddenly pours with thick, blood red chakra covering his whole body, and burning his skin, and everything around it. The sheer power would've killed any lesser person, but Naruto is no lesser person. The power grows even more, with one ethereal tail made out of said chakra appeared at Naruto's behind, right above his tailbone, before another, then another, then another appeared, and before long, all nine tails of Kurumi's chakra appeared behind him, while he is still being covered with the same chakra. Suddenly, slowly but surely, the blood red chakra changes colour into gold from one tail to another. Each tail takes one whole day to turn from blood red to a blinding gold, taking nine days entirely. Another day was taken to change the chakra cloak's colour from blood red to gold, and now, instead of the damaging and vile chakra that covers him, a golden hue, bright as the sun, covered his body with ten chakra tails lazily swaying behind him that brings a feeling of life and joy. And as suddenly as it started, the gold chakra suddenly recedes into Naruto's 6' 1" naked body, which as suddenly, grew a pair of fox ears on his head, and ten 1.5 metre long white tipped golden fox tails grew from behind his tailbone, while a strange golden fox like mark appeared at his chest, right above his heart. And suddenly, the gold chakra flared again, before it moved away from Naruto's unmoving body, and slowly shaped itself into a slim, feminine body, before coalescing completely into a naked women, 5' 5" tall with long, bright red hair, round face and blue eyes, with a medium sized breasts, not too big, yet not too small, long, slender legs and a toned stomach, but what is the most surprising is the pair of foxlike ears on her head, and the nine 1 meter long white tipped golden tails that appeared at her back, and the golden fox mark that appeared on her on the same place Naruto has his mark. She woke up first, and looked at her body, and shouted "Why am I outside? And naked? Where's Naruto?" (AN: from now on, Kurumi and Naruto, unless they went into their full demon form, will talk like regular person)</p><p>She turned around, and saw a naked Naruto with the same extra appendages as she did, still sitting in the lotus position before a breeze came in, and she shivered, and scooted closer to Naruto and hugged him, enjoying the warmth his enhanced body provides her. She remained in this position for a while, until Naruto slowly opened his eyes, watching everything around him in deliberate slowness, tears falling unbidden, before realising that someone is hugging him, and the two globes of flesh at his back. He turned his head around, and what he saw made him shocked, and asked just one question : "Mom?"</p><p>"Mom? What do you mean by mom?"</p><p>"You're not mom? Then are you Kurumi-chan? Because you looked just like mom. Here. Take a look."</p><p>Naruto unsealed a pocket mirror and showed it to Kurumi, who looked at her reflection within the mirror and gasped. "What the hell, father?! I look just like Kushina-chan! You old man! Are you trolling me here?!" somewhere in the Pure World, an old sage was rolling on the floor laughing his ass out due to the final prank his soul shard played on his daughter.</p><p>"Damn that old man. Even during his death he still wants to prank us. Dammit. But at least I have a human form now. And Naruto, how do you know I looked like your mother?"</p><p>"Well, it goes like this..."</p><p>-FLASHBACK A COUPLE OF MINUTES AGO WITHIN NARUTO'S MINDSCAPE-</p><p>Naruto woke up, and saw that once again, he was in the white space. Watching the white borders again, Naruto screamed. "So is there anything else you wanted to talk to me? I thought you are done testing my heart?"</p><p>"Not quite, Naruto." Naruto whirled around, knowing that there are no enemies within this space, but what he saw blows his breath away.</p><p>There, standing with all the might and pride that they have, stood Namikaze Minato and his wife, Uzumaki-Namikaze Kushina, Naruto's parents. Minato's spiky blonde hair, as spiky as ever, and Kushina's long bright red flowing hair, these are the features that Naruto remembers the most from their parents. Looking at them, Naruto said, "Mom, dad..." and ran at them, hugging them like his life depends on them, even with his 6' 2" height, which makes hugging difficult.</p><p>"Naruto, my son... you have grown well... I didn't ex-"</p><p>"Actually dad," Naruto interrupted, "I'm only six years old."</p><p>"WHAT?! How are you so tall?! You're six!? What has Kurumi been doing with you!?" Kushina screamed. Then Naruto started to explain what happened since he first met Kurumi, what she has been teaching him, his new bloodline, his training, his journeys, and what he did during those times. Needless to say, both Kushina and Minato are stupefied at what their child went through in his extremely young age. Then he was hugged by both Minato and Kushina at once.</p><p>"Oh Naruto... know that I didn't meant to place such a burden on you... but I know that you will be the one to remove the world of hatred, and bring peace. Make sure that you do that, okay? This will be the last wish that I will place on your shoulders." said Minato, before he starts to disappear in flecks of light, still smiling to his son.</p><p>"Dad?! DAD!" Naruto, who was in tears by now, is hurriedly trying to pick up the pieces of his father, to no avail. He then slumped in tears on the white room, with his mom hugging him immediately.</p><p>"Naruto, the only reason why we're here to see you is that we sealed part of us, Minato his chakra, and me my soul, within the seal, so that we can appear to either guide you or stop you when you tried to pry open the seal completely, especially during times of extreme anger. We hoped that time never came, and it never did. The reason why you are seeing us here right now is because the seal was broken completely, and my spirit and your father's safety measures kicked in, though not for the reason that we envisioned, which is good. We can sense that we are no longer needed, and our time here is up."</p><p>"NO, MOM! DON'T GO! NO, PLEASE!" Naruto screamed, as he cried his heart out while grabbing Kushina with no intent of letting go, but alas, Kushina still disappeared, still, at a slower rate.</p><p>"Naruto, my son... always remember that we will always watch you from the Pure World, always looking at you, supporting you in everything from afar. Do not cry for out deaths, for death comes to everyone. Naruto, always remember to treat your elders nicely, remember to eat your vegetables and not left anything, don't forget to train hard, remember to treat Kurumi-chan well, she's your life's mate anyway. We will not be there to see you, so always remember us in your heart, and don't forget to give me cute grandchildrens! Goodbye Naruto, and always remember us in your heart... I love you, my son..." Kushina said to Naruto, all while disappearing within the hug of her son, who was still bawling his heart out to her. She disappeared completely afterwards, leaving nothing behind, but memories and advices.</p><p>Naruto, now still crying while lying on the white floor, but has accepted the disappearance of both of his parents' avatar, stood up, and with his face still full of tears and his eyes still wet and pouring with tears of both joy and sadness, balled his hand in a fist and places it on his heart, closed his eyes, looked downwards, before making an oath to himself.</p><p>"I, Uzumaki-Namikaze Naruto, will do my absolute best to create peace in this world, and to rid the world of hatred, so that no one will have to suffer anymore, and so that no wars will start anymore, and upon the souls of my parents, I swore that I will achieve this goal I set to myself, and will spread teachings of love throughout the whole world, and so will my descendants, while keeping myself strong to go against any who wishes to remove this peace. May the gods themselves tremble, for I will take the world by storm!" Naruto shouted. He then let his hands fall down, and his surroundings turned black, with him blacking out.</p><p>-FLASHBACK ENDS, ALSO, LEMON SCENE COMETH-</p><p>"...And then I woke up, and felt you (here, he blushed) on my back, and saw that you look like my mom."</p><p>"...Yeah. I swear that this is the old man's final prank to me beyond the grave. But look at you! You look awesome!"</p><p>Puzzled, Naruto tried to think about what she meant, before he felt the weird appendages at his back and on his head. Feeling a bit naughty, Kurumi stroked one of his tails while nibbling on his ear, which caused his tails to stand ramrod straight at his back, an involuntary moan came from his mouth, and an amazing boner popped immediately from his sitting position. Looking at his massive 8" erection <i>"Hmm... I guess that all the enhancements that I gave did more than just let his body grow..."</i>, she decides that he must've liked it, and continued her ministrations.</p><p>"K-k-kurumi-chan... W-w-what are you..Oooh that felt good.. wait, what are you doing?!" Naruto asked while still under the ministrations of Kurumi's hands and nibbles.</p><p>"Oh this? Don't worry, just relax, and let me handle everything..." Said Kurumi, who then uses her other hand to grab Naruto's manhood, causing him to jerk. Smirking, Kurumi starts stroking his penis while still nibbling his sensitive ears and rubbing his tails, especially at their base, finding that the tails are twitching more when her hand gently touches the position. Then, Naruto, who by now is just a mess of panting, flushed glob of flesh, starts twitching even more, while Kurumi's hand, which was currently stroking his penis even faster, starts panting even more. "K-kurumi-c-chan... I think something is, urgh, something is coming!"</p><p>"Don't worry about it, Naruto. Don't hold back. This is going to be your first ejaculation, so don't hold back! Let it go!" said Kurumi, stroking his twitching dick even faster. Then suddenly, all his tails seem to harden even more if that is possible, with the furs spiking like an angry cat's tail, and his dick twitches for the last time, before releasing a massive stream of cum, which falls into Kurumi's awaiting hand, and the ground. Naruto's face, by now sporting a huge blush, felt like it went through the most awesome experience ever, which, in a way, he does.</p><p>"So? How do you like it?" Kurumi asked, while licking his cum on her fingers in front of him.</p><p>"K-kurumi-chan... that was totally great... I cannot tell you how good that was, and now you looked extremely hot, and now I'm feeling weird..."</p><p>"Naruto, stop. You're talking incoherently now. You don't have to say anything, just follow what I told you to do." She then turned around and placed her pussy into Naruto's face. Naruto, still feeling the high of his first ejaculation, didn't even reply and started licking her pussy instinctively. Kurumi, having her pussy licked so suddenly, moans loudly in pleasure, and places her pussy even closer to Naruto's face, which is now buried deep into her pussy.</p><p>Naruto, intoxicated by the love nectar that drips from her pussy, didn't think of anything but to eat all that delicious stuff dripping from her cunt. He licks it even faster then, and sucked on that weird ball of flesh that he instinctively, again just licked. The action sends jolts of pleasure to Kurumi, whose tails are now hanging in the air, her face on the ground while making moaning sounds that causes Naruto to further go into a state of delirium, and with one final lick on her clitoris, her pussy juices gushed out of her pussy hole, which Naruto eagerly lapped, like a drug.</p><p>Still feeling a bit delirious, Naruto immediately stood up, and almost placed his throbbing cock into her pussy, when he suddenly broke out of the trance he was in before saying "W-what am I doing? I was licking your pussy, and suddenly I'm going to do this? What's wrong with me?! Sorry Kurumi-chan, sorry!"</p><p>"There's no need to apologize Naruto. This is a lesson for the day. When sex is forced, it's rape. When it's between two people with consent, it's just sex. But when two lovers are doing it, then it's called making love. Now STOP TALKING AND START POUNDING MY PUSSY!"</p><p>Naruto, then gulped due to the voice of his lover, inserted his dick into her pussy slowly, and felt it meeting a barrier of sorts. "Damn, Kurumi-chan, you're tight. But what's this barrier I felt?"</p><p>"That's called the hymen Naruto, and sometimes it shows that a person is still a virgin. You can thrust hard into me to broke it, but know that I will be in a bit of pain later. So kiss me at that time."</p><p>Not trusting his body, Naruto asked Kurumi to change position so that she is lying down with him on top. Then, Naruto rammed her pussy with his cock, breaking her hymen and went straight into the deep, where Naruto groaned in pleasure due to the tightness of her pussy and immediately kissed Kurumi, who was feeling some pain due to Naruto's fast penetration and her own virginity. They immediately started a tongue war, swapping spit and fought for dominance, which Naruto loses, though he didn't mind, as long as Kurumi is not feeling any pain. He then moved his hands which grabs her perky, erect D-cup breasts and started massaging them, sending jolts of pleasure through her body.</p><p>"N-naruto, you can move now, I'm fine.."</p><p>"O-okay..." Naruto then started to move slowly, while still massaging her breasts, and licking her nipple, which causes her to moan loudly. Her moans seem to awaken some kind of animal instinct within Naruto, which causes him to pound her pussy faster and stronger, causing Kurumi to scream in pleasure. He never stopped his massage of her breasts, and kept fondling, licking and kissing her breasts, even as he was busy moving his dick inside her pussy, intent on sending her into a pleasure induced coma.</p><p>By this time, Kurumi is already screaming incoherently, something that sounds like "Faster, harder" , though with Naruto's pleasure ridden brain, he didn't caught on to this, but still pistoned her pussy non-stop before Kurumi suddenly screamed "NARUTO! I'M CUMMING! I'M CUMMING! DON'T STOP!"</p><p>Naruto, who by now is almost at his limit as well, just rammed her pussy even more before he suddenly felt her vaginal walls contract, squeezing his dick, thus making him shoot massive streams of cum within her pussy and so do Kurumi, cumming together with no signs of stopping.</p><p>After a couple of minutes, Naruto pulled his cock outside of Kurumi's pussy, making some of the cum within her pussy flowed out, his Astartes constitution making him feel as energetic as ever, though even he felt a little tired, like he ran a 50 kilometer marathon non-stop, which was not much by his standard.</p><p>"So, how does that feel?" Kurumi asked Naruto, while moving forward to kiss him.</p><p>"That was totally great. I never felt so good before in my life." And he took her invitation to kiss her directly, meeting her face and starting another tongue battle. Which she stopped. "Remember Naruto, we are now lovers, and you are my mate. This is actually the second thing that you should do to be my mate. So, my husband, Uzumaki-Namikaze Naruto, will you accept me, Uzumaki-Namikaze Kurumi as your mate and wife, forever will be at my side?"</p><p>"I, Uzumaki-Namikaze Naruto, accepts you, Uzumaki-Namikaze Kurumi, as my mate, my wife, and the future bearer of my kids, and will forever stood by you, in health or in sickness and in pain or in glory, may nothing do us part."</p><p>"Then so it shall be." And she kissed Naruto again, who is already preparing for a round two. For the entire day, the clearing was filled with the sound of moanings of pleasure among the two lovers, where nobody disturbs them, the border seals doing their job perfectly.</p><p>-END LEMON-</p><p>The next day, Kurumi woke up after a long night of marathon sex which causes her pussy felt sore, so sore that she is sure that she won't be walking right, or even be walking after such a passion filled night. But then, Naruto asked something to her while he was packing to leave.</p><p>"Kurumi-koi, how are you so good at that? Sex, I mean."</p><p>"Well, being sealed for a long time with women that are in good relations with me, allowing me to see and feel through them, combined with the fact that they both are almost perpetually horny and had sex nearly every night has its perks you know. Do you know that both Mito's and your mom's sex drive increases exponentially when they're pregnant? Maybe it's an Uzumaki women's thing. Your dad almost had a heart attack due to the sheer sex drive and horniness that Kushina-chan felt during her pregnancy, not that he hates it."</p><p>"I'm sure I didn't need to hear that last part. Anyway, we're packing and leaving this area later."</p><p>"Wait. Naruto, do you felt anything strange after the absorption of my powers? I'm very sure that the tails aren't just the only thing that changes when I moved my powers to you."</p><p>"Yeah, you're right. Let's see. I'll try to meditate and see what's in my mindscape, now that you're gone." Immediately, Naruto sat in the lotus position again, and went into his mindscape. And what he found there astonished him. The tree, which before became somewhat of a house for Kurumi, now has its leaves turned into vines, wrapping a huge ball of... something, that was even bigger than the sun in his mindscape. Feeling curious, Naruto reached his hands towards the ball, and tried ordering it to move to him. Incredibly, to him, a part of the ball extended and touched his arms, and a feeling of power and life flowed through him, more power than he can ever think of flowed through him and kept flowing.</p><p>Outside, kurumi was watching the body of Naruto, still remembering their activities last night, which causes her to blush, when suddenly, a huge spike of chakra, larger than any other that even she had felt, which makes her power felt minuscule in comparison, came from Naruto, and suddenly, his body was wreathed in pure golden flames. Kurumi, feeling shocked and curious at the same time, touched the golden flames, which didn't burn, and yet didn't felt evil like her chakra. More like it was filled with life, and then, a bit of the chakra flowed into her body, and instantly she felt revitalized! Any pain she felt from last night was gone, and her body felt amazing! She was so awed by thwis that she didn't realize that Naruto's eyes are open, and he immediately jumped in shock.</p><p>"Holy shit! What's this?! It felt like that weird ball of something within the mindscape, but it's different! This is awesome!" Naruto exclaimed, until he saw Kurumi, who was still standing in awe at his appearance.</p><p>"Love, I think this is actually the purified power of the Juubi, and somehow it felt much more powerful than what it once was. It is extremely weird, but it is totally great, and it might be useful as a trump card of sorts."</p><p>Naruto then concentrated, and turned off the Chakra Cloak, and starts to pack, before he remembered something. "Kurumi-koi, I must leave for a while. Since you gained a human form, I need to look for clothes for you to wear during our journeys. I'll go to a nearby town to look for clothes for you, okay. Just stay there." And with that, Naruto left, leaving Kurumi to get used to her human body. During the time Naruto goes to look for her clothes, she found out that she has lost all her powers except for some, and is slowly gaining them back. She predicted that by a year, she would manage to recover her whole powers back. She also found out that with some concentration, she can turn into a human form, back to her hanyou form, and to a fox demon form, which is a golden fox with nine red tipped tails, with its size pretty much adjustable. She then practiced all her movements in this form while waiting for Naruto.</p><p>Sometime later, Naruto managed to come back with a sealing scroll filled entirely with her clothes. Picking her clothes, she opted for a black, loose fitting shirt (she didn't want anybody except for Naruto to see her body), with a pair of loose fitting trousers and covered ninja sandals with a grey cloak covering her back with a piece of string tying it at the front. Naruto took some time because he was busy placing seals on the clothes after buying them. Sometime later, after they had finished packing their stuff, and Kurumi explained to Naruto about their capability to transform (which makes Naruto facepalm, because he just hid his tails within his cloak and his ears with his hoodie) , they left the clearing, not forgetting to use a special chakra absorption seal to absorb any of their ambient chakra in the area to prevent them from being tracked.</p><p>-BREAK-</p><p>Naruto, now travelling with Kurumi, did the same thing that he did before, which was travelling around, watching the sights, while training himself to his breaking point, which was long and far in between, but with another added activity, which was having sex with Kurumi in the night. Life was going well for them, Naruto was extremely powerful and well trained, Kurumi herself can go toe to toe with Naruto due to experience, and any wounds that they both gained are healed nearly instantly by the purified chakra, which Kurumi also gained, and which has recovered by about a tail's worth.</p><p>About two months later, the lovers are just waking up from their sleep (AN: Remember that Naruto still needs sleep, at about 8 hours per week or around an hour per day, though he can extend his no sleeping time by forcing the Catalepsean Node to work overtime, but allowing him to fight or work for weeks.) when suddenly, a wave of nausea hit Kurumi, and she immediately ran towards the edges of their campsite and pukes her dinner from last night there. Naruto, ever vigilant, immediately woke up and rushed towards Kurumi and rubbed her back, asking her if there are any problems. She just brushed him off, and said that it will get better in a short time.</p><p>While travelling to their next destination, a small town by the name of Hinamizawa near the border of Earth Country, he saw that she did not get better, in fact, it seems that she got worse, kept throwing up at any moment, and suddenly getting nauseous. He immediately picked her up despite her protests, and immediately ran towards Hinamizawa, and took her towards the clinic, ran by a doctor named Irie, and his assistant, a nurse named Takano. Looking at Kurumi, they immediately took her to the diagnostic room, where Naruto was not allowed to enter.</p><p>Sitting on a special chair (AN: He's too heavy for regular chairs) that he brought himself with his chin stood up by his fists, with his elbows on his knee, thoughts running at kilometres per second in his head. What happened to Kurumi? Why is she suddenly like that? Did she ate something wrong? But she never got sick before!</p><p>While Naruto had all this thoughts running through his mind, Irie came out from the examination room, and Naruto immediately rushed the doctor, and start showering him with questions, which was stopped by him lifting up a hand.</p><p>"Naruto-san, I have news to you about your wife. She's pregnant, and you're gonna be a father!"</p><p>Naruto, stupefied, can only say one thing to the doctor: "...huh?"</p><p>"Your wife is two months pregnant, Arashi-san, and you are going to be a father!" having a new life born into the world is always an exciting prospect for Irie. But then he sees that Naruto is just standing with a blank look on his face. "Arashi-san? Arashi-san?" he waved his hands in his face, no response. But when he touched him, he immediately fell on the floor, cracking it with his weight. "NARUTO –SAN! Takano, go get me a stretcher! He's a new father!" Takano, hearing this, rolled her eyes, and went to get a stretcher for Naruto.</p><p>And thus ends the first year of Naruto's journey across the elemental nations, yet there will be more to come...</p><p>-CHAPTER ENDS-</p><p>Whew! This is my longest chapter ever, at 12k something words! So how do you like this chapter and the accompanying lemon? It's okay? It's not? This chap is meant to show more of Naruto's brutal side which he shows towards his enemies, of which he will have no mercy against. Also, this chapter is meant to show his loving side to his loved ones. I hope I got it right. Please review, and tell me what you think of the story. Also, there will be no accompanying Higurashi plot in this fanfic! I cannot think of a town's name, thus I decided to borrow one! Till next time, Happy reading!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>Hello everyone and welcome to a new chapter of A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel! Today I have nothing much to say, except for the fact that I am looking for a good beta reader, and wished that someone would take that position so that I can rectify the mistakes that I did within this story! Thank you to Hanabi's Biggest Fan and True Glint! Your great reviews have shown where or what I did wrong, and I will try to improve my writings, though it might not be for a while, I guess. Well, enough of that! Without further ado, here's a new chapter of A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel!</P><P>CHAPTER 4: PREGNANCY AND NEW LIFE</P><P>-CHAPTER START-</P><P>Naruto woke up with a start, looked beside him and found out that his wife, and mate, Uzumaki-Namikaze Kurumi was asleep at his bedside while holding his hand. He bent down and kissed her head, while saying "Good morning, my love. I think I heard that some doctor said that you are pregnant, and I will be a father, and you a mother soon. Can't believe that that happens so fast. It seems that I must remember to use protection next time.*chuckles*"</P><P>She woke up, yawned cutely, and said "Believe it, Naruto-koi. I am pregnant, and if you want proof, you can see it for yourself. Try channelling the purified youki (AN: demon chakra, in case some readers didn't know) that we have into your palm, and place the palm on my abdomen."</P><P>Naruto then followed the advice, long since knowing that the purified chakra felt like life energy, and can be used to sense other lifeform around them, and channelled the purified youki into his palm, and places the palm on her abdomen. Immediately he felt something different within his wife, the feeling of another life being carried within his wife's womb, and he cried.</P><P>"Naru-koi, what's wrong? Why are you crying?" she said, while wiping the tears of Naruto's face.</P><P>"Don't get me wrong, Kurumi-koi. I didn't cry because of sadness, I cried because of my happiness, the knowledge that I will be a father, and you a mother, with the child, the baby you are carrying the proof of our love, and the result of our lovemaking. These are tears of joy, my love, and not of sadness."</P><P>Hearing such heartfelt words from her lover, she also cried tears of joy, and both of them sat comfortably in each other's embrace, preparing themselves to face the challenges to come with their family.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>The next day, the doctor taught Naruto on what to expect on being a father. The hormonal imbalance, the morning sickness, the mood swings, the potential sex drive increase (not that he hates that), and all the pain that she will endure makes him think back on having a child. But when he's back to her room, and seeing that would-be mother's shine on her face makes everything that she and him will encounter worth it.</P><P>"Kurumi-koi, the doctor has taught me what to expect during your pregnancy, and I'd have to say that it's going to be a huge hassle. But seeing how you looked just now, that shine on your face, thinking of our future son or daughter, makes it all worthwhile."</P><P>"I know. The nurse, Takano, has already taught me what to expect as well. It seems that we cannot travel well during the early stages of the pregnancy, because of the morning sickness that I will encounter, which means that we need to stay here for about a week or two until it passes. They also said that I will probably experience back pains and a lot of other pains during the early stages of pregnancy."</P><P>"All right. I guess the only thing we can do right now is to wait for the pains and all to come, then we will face it head on. Or should we leave now? Staying at one spot would be dangerous for us, seeing that we're bounty hunters as well."</P><P>"...I guess you're right, love. Well, let me pack my stuff first, and then we'll walk to another town. I guess that we'll have to change doctors often, eh?"</P><P>"Yeah. Sorry for putting this burden on you, my love."</P><P>"Yeah, I know. Now please hug me. I feel like I'm in need of a hug, or maybe more."</P><P>Naruto immediately hugged her tightly, not feeling like releasing her forever, while she also hugged him as well. And then, suddenly, Kurumi cried, for no apparent reason.</P><P>"Kurumi-koi, what happened to you? Why are you crying? Did I do something wrong?"</P><P>"No, you did not. But *sniff* I suddenly felt the need to cry...* sniff* I don't know what went to me. Please, don't let go, and I'll pack after this."</P><P>Naruto just nodded, and gave his shoulder for her to cry on. Which she gladly took, and 5 minutes later, she stopped crying, and started packing all her stuff, and preparing herself to leave. Meanwhile, Naruto went to meet Dr. Irie, and say some words of thanks to him.</P><P>"Dr. Irie, I thank you for all the advices that you gave me on how to handle her pregnancy. Here's the money for taking care of her and for the teachings that you gave us. "</P><P>"It's my pleasure Arashi-san. May we meet again on a later date, together with your child."</P><P>After thanking him, Naruto went to her room, and saw that she is already packed and ready to leave. They immediately went out of Hinamizawa, and entered the road, and started a new journey, one with a third person on the way. But even during the start of the journey, Naruto found out that she cannot go at their original speed, thus slowing down their journey greatly. Naruto was forced to break camp early every day, and every morning, the only thing that Naruto can help with her morning sickness is by letting her lie down and stops their journey, preventing her from feeling worse, while Naruto himself guards their rest point. Even so, he still didn't stop from taking missions, mostly bandit clearing missions and bounty hunting missions.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>"It's the fourth month already, love, and your baby bump is showing already. I still can't believe that in a couple of months I will be a father."</P><P>"WHAT?! ARE YOU CALLING ME FAT?!"</P><P>"NO! No! I will not call you fat! You are beautiful, never say otherwise, and I will never say so too. My love, you are beautiful. Never say otherwise. I will not let my wife undermine herself."</P><P>"*sniff* Really? Are you really saying that? *sniff* Please, hold me.."</P><P>Naruto then proceeds to hug her body, her crying face on his shoulder. Inwardly, Naruto sighed. These mood fluctuations, although he had been warned of it, was still very much a problem. She can turn from extremely happy, to extremely sad, to being a crybaby, to feeling touchy, all at the drop of a hat. Even the fluctuations of her chakra are really bad sometimes. Her mood fluctuates her chakra's rhythm, causing her to activate her chakra form all of a sudden, even when she's sleeping, then when she wakes up, she pummels him with a vicious taijutsu combo, before suddenly stopping, and hugged him while crying and saying "I'm sorry, I'm sorry" multiple times.</P><P>But still, Naruto held strong and firm, knowing that during these rough times, he will be the rock for Kurumi to hold on to, and the strong point of their lives. And looking at her happy face is more than enough for him to remove all the pain from taking care of his wife.</P><P>"Here, turn around. I'll give you a back rub."</P><P>"Thanks. I guess that these mood swings are really bothering you, right?"</P><P>Naruto expertly started rubbing her back, massaging her aching muscles with Kurumi moaning in pleasure. This will only get worse later on, Naruto thought. "And I will always be there for you, believe it."</P><P>Suddenly, she turned around and kissed him forcefully, having a tongue battle between them both. Naruto, shocked, by the sudden kiss, can only respond instinctively, while feeling her enlarging boobs on his chest. She then looked at him with one of the horniest look that her face has ever had, and whispered seductively to Naruto, "Love, take me, right now!" Naruto can't help but shiver from the sheer lust emanating from her mate. Once again, sighing mentally due to her weird mood swings, Naruto just surrendered, and prepared to bang his very hot, pregnant wife. Not that he hates it, mind you. He even likes the taste of her milk, and he just knows that their child will be having a tough competition for the tit to drink from.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Still within the fourth month of her pregnancy, Kurumi suddenly felt very sad and lonely one day, when Naruto is off on another mission. Due to that, she decided to track him down and follow him to his mission, without his knowledge. After a while of following his mate mark, she found him, currently decimating an entire bandit camp, and crushing them under the power of his fists. She looked at him in awe, even though she had seen the same scene tens of times, even joined in some of his hunter-killer missions, each and every time he attacked a camp is still a sight for her to behold. "Naru-koi, your power... it's just too attracting... this baby will be a powerful child, as well." She whispered to herself.</P><P>Unknown to her, a couple of the bandits heard that, and immediately thought that she is his lover or something, and tried capturing her. Still enraptured by the sight of Naruto, Kurumi didn't realise that she was about to be captured until she was captured, her eyes widened due to her own idiocy. The bandits then brought her to their camp, where Naruto was still slaughtering the bandits.</P><P>"Hey you! Stop attacking us! Or we will kill your wife here and your baby as well!" the bandit shouted.</P><P>Upon hearing this, Naruto turned around, and saw a sight that he will never forget: Kurumi being restrained by bandits, with swords and other pointy items held towards her. Naruto's eyes blinked, and suddenly, a rage unlike no other bubbled from within him, and he was consumed by the desire to kill, kill KILL!</P><P>The bandits, thinking that they already have leverage towards Naruto, was instantly floored when an aura of golden flames shrouded Naruto, and that was the last thing they did, where Naruto appeared right in front of them, his hands through the heads of two of the bandits, with his chakra arms cutting the rest of the bandits into two pieces, from their head straight through their crotches. Naruto then immediately caught Kurumi, who fell to the ground, tears falling from her face.</P><P>"Kurumi-koi! Why did you leave the campsite?! You have endangered not just you, but our child as well!"</P><P>"I-i-I know! But I am so lonely! I suddenly felt very much alone, like you're not here, at all! I-*sniff*-i—i..." that was all that she managed to say, before she started sobbing and crying madly. Upon hearing this, Naruto's eyes, harder than steel initially, softened, and he immediately went forward to hug his love, currently on the ground.</P><P>"My love, it is not my intention to leave you alone, but our journey depends on me taking up the missions, not to mention that now you need to eat for two, thus requiring me to do more missions for our living. True that I can hunt and forage for us, but for certain things, it's better for us to have some money for us to last. I'm sorry if I got mad at you, but what you just did is wrong, and I hoped that you learned your lesson today."</P><P>Kurumi didn't say anything, and just cried on Naruto's shoulder, while Naruto hugged her. After she had cried herself to sleep, he carried her bridal style, still covered in blood, to their campsite, and placed her on their futon, with their bag acting as a makeshift pillow, while he himself creates clones to act as lookout for the camp. Naruto sighed, knowing that his wife's mood swings are even more insane nowadays, now that the fourth month is closing in. <I>"We better start looking for a place to settle down fast, while her pregnancy is still going. Makes it easier to get medical support." </I>Naruto thought.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>It's the fifth month, and Kurumi's mood swings got even worse. Though so does her sex drive, causing even Naruto, with his Astartes constitution, to feel a bit tired. Having sex for almost the whole day will do that to anyone, especially when during the act, she started crying due to his loving and her own feelings. It's like any emotion that she felt was magnified a hundred times! Irie already told him that this would happen but this seems like a bit too much. She even cried due to his back rub once, while saying that he is the most understanding mate ever and continued crying an entire river, before proceeding to ride his dick like no tomorrow. It's a very confusing experience for Naruto, who was busy scratching the back of his head using one of his chakra arms, while carrying his wife, who was sleeping, bridal style with his actual arms. <I>"I swear, if I didn't love her so much, I would've dumped her somewhere!"</I> but even so, Naruto's eyes kept going towards her abdomen, where the baby bump is even more prominent nowadays, and he can even felt the life within even stronger, which almost overwhelmed him at one point.</P><P>Then, she suddenly woke up and stretched in his arms, before placing her arms around his neck and gave him a kiss. "Good morning Naru-koi." Her good morning was interrupted by a loud growl coming from her stomach. Blushing, she continued, "...And I'm hungry. Can we stop to eat?"</P><P>"Again? Our food supplies are almost out. That means we'll have to break camp early again and I'll have to hunt again. You sure eat a lot don't you nowadays?" Naruto joked, which was a wrong thing to say, from the killing intent emanating from her towards him. She then turned, ever so slowly to face Naruto.</P><P>"...Are you saying I'm fat?" she asked in a very low volume. By now, Naruto was sweating profusely, while still carrying her in his arms, not keen on just letting her go, even if she's extremely pissed at him right now.</P><P>"NO! As I said before, you are NOT fat! You are beautiful! That baby bump makes you look even more adorable!"</P><P>"Really?!" She asked, her face suddenly turning to a shining beacon of happiness from the sombre mood it looks like before.</P><P>"Yes! Of course! We'll break camp now, and I'll cook you some food! You're hungry right?" Naruto, with all his nearly nonexistent skill in misdirecting a conversation, tried to pull her thoughts away from thinking of mutilating him, not that she is capable of doing so, the back pains that she is currently experiencing has gotten worse, and she couldn't even walk right. And considering that they're always on the move, this makes her feel bad most of the time.</P><P>"Okay!" she chirped happily, not realising that he was probably saying that she eats a lot now.</P><P>Letting a sigh of relief out, Naruto then stopped and created clones to place the usual complement of seals around their camp, while the real Naruto prepped their tent, and started to take out their food supplies, which mainly consists of wild fruits and game. While he created another clone to prepare their food, Naruto talked with Kurumi about his plans.</P><P>"Kurumi-koi, I don't think that we can move around too much with you being this pregnant, so I think it is better for us to find a town for us to settle down for a bit. While I'm there, I can even learn some other things than just ways to kill people, and it is easier for us to get a doctor to check up on you once in a while."</P><P>"Hmm... I suppose that's a good idea. Any ideas on where should we stay?" from outside the tent, the smell of cooked food wafted into the tent, causing Kurumi's stomach to grumble even harder. "...Talk more after we eat." Nodding, Naruto went outside to eat the meal prepared by his clone, which was just a simple roasted deer thigh, which was quickly eaten by the two of them.</P><P>"So," Kurumi started, while wiping her mouth. "Where should we stay? Any plans?"</P><P>"Looking at the map, we can go towards Hot Springs Country, and stay at a town there, maybe learn a couple of things or two. From our current location (In Rice Country), we could reach the border of Hot Springs in a week with our current travelling speed. Then, I suggest we settle down at a town somewhere around or make our own house while minimising contact with everyone, as to not expose our identity. Is that fine?"</P><P>"Hmm... I think that's a great idea! All this travelling is making my back hurt even more. I'll probably need you to lift me again until we reached the town that you want to go, and let's hope that we won't encounter any enemies during our way there. For now, I just want to sleep, I'm tired."</P><P>"And I'll set up a perimeter to train as well."</P><P>Then, life continued as always, with the two lovers walking towards their destination, a town in Hot Springs Country called Karakura.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>After one week of uneventful travel, if you didn't count the sheer emotions running on Kurumi's face and body during their trip there, they managed to reach Karakura Town, a decent sized town, surrounded by huge plains, with a river at the north side of the town, providing food and irrigation for some of the farms within the town. The lovers immediately went to meet the doctor, a Dr. Kurosaki Isshin, one who has lived in the town for years, and asked for a check up for Kurumi's condition.</P><P>"So how is it?" Naruto, ever the loving and expectant father, immediately asked the doctor about his wife on her condition after he finishes doing all the necessary checks.</P><P>"Her pregnancy is going fine, there are no problems at all. In fact, she is the healthiest pregnant woman I have ever checked, and that's saying something. You said that you are travellers?"</P><P>"Yes. We travelled all over before we met at the border of Grass and Fire, and after that we started travelling together, and you can say that we fell in love during those times."</P><P>"*chuckles* Ah, young love. I still remember mine, and my wife, who became the centre of my universe, and who gave me three children, Ichigo, Karin and Yuzu. I loved them so much, but when their mother died, they took it harder than I ever did. Enough reminiscing for me. Now back to you, I'd say that you better stop your journeys, and is better off just staying at one spot, don't go around everywhere. It makes it hard for the baby. "</P><P>"True. And I AM planning on settling here for a while, at least until the baby is born, so I would like to ask if there are any jobs available around here that I can earn from."</P><P>"Hmm... you better ask my son, Ichigo. He's currently working at the smithy, and I think that he once said to me that his place needs a pair of strong hand to work with, since the previous smith is old and is no longer capable of holding the hammer."</P><P>"Hmm... A smith here sounds like a pretty decent job. I guess I'll ask him later."</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>After meeting the doctor, he created two clones, one henge'd to go with him to buy supplies to build a small house outside of town, while the other went to the smithy's to ask for a job. After finding the local lumberjack, he bought himself a whole bunch of planks and logs, and sealed all of it within a scroll, which shocked the lumberjack, never having seen how ninjas used sealing scrolls to carry lots of bulk items at once. He also bought all the necessary supplies to build a house, namely nails, and some other stuff.</P><P>After that, he went to the site which he has chosen to build his house, a clearing on the plains, with the river close by, and started to build himself a simple, cosy cabin using his clones. After a couple minutes of building the house, while one clone tended to Kurumi's needs, he gained the memories of the clone that he sent to the smith's.</P><P>-FLASHBACK WITH CLONE'S MEMORY-</P><P>He found the smith's shop, a simple building with a wooden part up front and a wall of rocks that surrounds the furnace at the back, with the smokestack of the furnace spewing black smoke out into the nature. He went inside to the counter, and ringed a bell. While waiting for this 'Ichigo' guy, the son of the doctor to come out, he looked around the shop itself. There was nothing special within the shop, just some regular tools and everyday metalwork stuff, like hoes, kitchen knives and other stuff, all placed on shelves within the shop. But suddenly, a glint of metal caught the clone's eyes. On the back of the shop, a sword is mounted on a wall. The sword is huge, with its blade being shaped like a cleaver, the base of the blade almost as big as a grown man's torso but with no guard between the blade and the hilt. The hilt itself is only wrapped in cloth, which was wrapped around the blade, somehow not cutting it. The blacksmith, who came in suddenly, was about to ask his potential customer on what he wants before he realises that the customer was looking at the sword on the wall.</P><P>"That's not for sale."</P><P>"What?" said the clone, who turned around and looked at the one who talked to him. The man is 5'9" tall, with spiky orange hair and wearing grey soot covered shirt, and a pair of black jeans.</P><P>"That's not for sale. If you want anything other than that, I'll have no problems making them for you. So, how can I help you?"</P><P>"Are you Ichigo?"</P><P>"Yeah. Are you looking for me?"</P><P>"Kinda. You see..." and the clone then explained the situation about Naruto, her wife, and their need for a job while they're staying around town.</P><P>"Damn that dad of mine, always places me in weird situations. Hmm... we would like to have a strong man to do the heavy lifting and all. Not that I'm not capable, but I sure think more would be better."</P><P>"And if it's possible, I would like to learn some blacksmithing arts as well."</P><P>"You sure look like someone who can learn the arts. I'll call the old man for a while." And with that, he went back to the back of the shop. A couple of minutes later, a man came out. He is 5'3", with white beard, and an almost completely bald head with gray hair, and holding a walking stick for his back. The old man than stared at the clone intently for a while, before he speaks.</P><P>"You have a strong heart kid. I can see that from your eyes. You said that you will stay here until your wife gives birth? Then that would be half a year, give or take. I guess I'll let you work here then. My name is Kagerou, and you better remember that, young one. Now leave, and be here tomorrow at 6 am." The old man, now identified as Kagerou spoke, and he went to the back of the shop again, while Ichigo turned back towards the clone.</P><P>"Well, I guess that the old man let you work here. My name's Kurosaki Ichigo. You would've known that, having met my dad. I guess we'll be co-workers then. See you tomorrow. Oh, and a last hint. Better follow whatever the old man says. If he said that you should be here by 6 am, then you'd better be here by 6 am. He hates latecomers. See ya tomorrow then." He said before turning back and went to the back of the shop again.</P><P>Taking the hint, the clone left, before going into a hidden alley and promptly dispels himself.</P><P>-CLONE FLASHBACK ENDS-</P><P>Smiling, Naruto immediately created more clones to further speed up the construction of the house, and before long, the house, which is more like a cabin, was completed. It has just 2 rooms, the bedroom and the kitchen, nothing else, for they are not planning to have any visitors there. The floors are planks, and there are no toilets and baths, for any cleansing business, the river's close by, or for hot water, they can just heat the water up using some coals. Since they are used to living just by nature and everything they can put their hands on, it is considered a luxury to stay at one place for a long time. So, for them, this cabin is already a fine one. They are not planning to stay for long anyway. Until their child is born, and then, they'll leave the town, and destroy their house, making their travels untraceable.</P><P>Smiling, Naruto went to Kurumi, who was now lying down on their futon, placed just on the grass outside the newly built cabin. "Kurumi-koi, the cabin is finished. We can move in there now. And I guess we'll be staying at this town for a while. The people here look friendly."</P><P>Kurumi wakes up, and gave Naruto a kiss. "Alright Naru-koi. I guess we can do that." And so, both of them gets ready to live their life there for a while, with their incoming baby as well.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>It's the sixth month, and her abdominal area has grown considerably now. Naruto can even feel the child move, and he decided to not find out the gender of their child first, but already planned the names for the baby, with Minato, in memory of his father, for a boy, and Kushina, in memory of his mother, for a girl. Kurumi, with all her extreme hormone influenced emotions, cried when she first felt the baby kicking, with Naruto crying as well when he first felt the kick, with him kissing her stomach afterwards. Right then and there, Naruto made a vow with himself, witnessed by Kurumi, that no children of his will go through the childhood that he went through, but will also be trained to their utmost potential.</P><P>His work at the smith's is as fine as ever. He absorbed the old smith's teaching like a sponge in water, capable of forging regular farming tools and knives in just one month of learning. During this time as well, he created more of his kunai, though without the knowledge of the old man. But then again, he knows that the old man knows about that, but decided against doing anything. He didn't bother him anyway.</P><P>Within this month, Naruto didn't go out on any missions, and stayed within the town, doing menial labour and helping the townsfolk while helping Kurumi cope with her pregnancy. She can no longer go out much, her pregnancy's taking a huge toll on her mobility and her capability to do anything. During these times, Naruto acted as the perfect husband, helping her around their cabin, doing chores, getting supplies, and cooking, though most of his cooked foods are all travel recipes, and usually is just what they can get their hands on during their travels, but nonetheless delicious.</P><P>They have been living life within the town for a while now, and Naruto shows that he is a very loving and understanding husband, but sadly for them, peace didn't last long, and is on the way to its end...</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>It's the eighth month of Kurumi's pregnancy, and everything is going smoothly for them. Kurumi's pregnancy is going well, and still is the healthiest pregnant woman Isshin has ever seen. Except for the usual symptoms of back pain, emotional unstability, and the mysterious disappearance of the smaller contractions, she is well and healthy. After finishing the checkups, he gave Kurumi some advice.</P><P>"You better tell your husband to help you a lot. It'll be harder for you to move now, and you'll be going to the toilet much more often than before. Also, you *pointing to Naruto* will probably need to stay up late to help her cope with her insomnia – the inability to sleep. Always be there for her, and you better help her with housework, because she's not going to be able to work, not with her condition like such."</P><P>"I understand, doctor. I'll take care of her well, believe it!" Naruto exclaimed, getting giggles from Kurumi, and a belly laugh from Isshin.</P><P>"Well, you better be, kid. Now run along, I have more appointments to go through today. Being the only doctor in a town is tiring you know."</P><P>Outside the clinic, the couple are walking back towards their house, with Kurumi holding Naruto's hand, while one hand kept rubbing her even bigger stomach. "I still can't believe that a life is growing within me. Human pregnancies are... amazing. We can feel them grow within us, talk to them, feel them there, it's... It's... amazing."</P><P>"Yeah, I can see that too. I may not be able to feel them grow, but that means that I must care for you even more right now. And being a bijuu hanyou is awesome, eh? Even the doc says that your pregnancy is the healthiest he's ever seen, and he's seen a lot of them. Also, if I remember correctly, you are taught by Hashirama and Mito. Do they not teach you some medical jutsu?"</P><P>"Hashirama's medical jutsu was one of a kind. It came naturally to him, so much so that it is impossible for him to teach it to others, me included. The perks of inheriting father's body I guess. He couldn't teach me medicinal knowledge, since all of his knowledge is somewhat imprinted within his mind, except for herbs, so he taught me the Mystical Palms jutsu to heal smaller wounds. Before you ask, I didn't teach you the technique because I thought that the Larraman's Organ would take care of any wounds, big or small. And I guess that it's right."</P><P>Naruto may have learned a lot of offensive and defensive jutsu,but he knows nothing about medical jutsu or even medical knowledge, unless if you include the points on where to kill someone.</P><P>"But if so, it makes it harder for me to treat you during your labour! We are planning to have the birth at the house, and it's better to not rely completely on our hanyou bodies isn't it? And when our child is born, then we'll need to know some medical knowledge to help heal both you and our child! And-" his ranting was cut short by Kurumi's finger on his lips.</P><P>"Love, you would have no problems with that. Remember, we are hanyous, and our bodies are naturally tougher than most people. Not to mention that your bloodline will be inherited by your children without fail. When I was making it, I made it so that there will be a certain genetic anomaly present that allows our descendants to definitely inherit the bloodline, combined with any other bloodline that the other pair has, and will definitely inherit both bloodlines without fail. So, our child will definitely gain your bloodline, and with the healing capabilities of your bloodline, they will have no problem healing themselves from any injuries, lethal or not. So don't worry."</P><P>Listening to such an assurance from his wife, Naruto calmed down and stopped fretting about all the wounds and illness that they will encounter, which causes Kurumi to slowly remove her finger and kissed him slowly. "You really are a loving person. That is what I loved about you. Please don't lose that about you. I know that you're a good choice for a mate."</P><P>Naruto blushed hard. Public display of affection is still something strange for him, and this is no different. He then smiled, hugging his wife, and continued their walk to their house. Suddenly, when they are about to walk out of the town's border, they saw a bunch of people walking while a samurai riding a horse was in front of them, probably leading them. Naruto and Kurumi immediately went to the side of their path, avoiding them, and immediately hiding themselves within the bushes close to the road. From afar, Naruto, with his enhanced eyesight, can already saw what they are. The person on the horse was a samurai, complete with body armor, and a nodachi at his back. The small army led by him was actually a bunch of bandits from the looks of it, no body armour, lack of training, and other aspects of them that identifies themselves as bandits. As such, Naruto concludes that the samurai up front is a disgraced ronin from somewhere, and he's leading a small army of bandits, probably took over the leadership by killing the old leader.</P><P>Still hiding within the bushes, Naruto waited until the bandits have passed before going out. Thinking of what to do, Kurumi pulled him, forcing him to turn towards her.</P><P>"Naruto, we should wait first for the bandits' actions before we start doing anything it's not good to attack them early if we didn't know what they are doing here."</P><P>Silently Naruto nodded, agreeing with her assessment. He then continued walking with Naruto guiding his wife to their cabin, with Naruto promising to check on the town later. About a while later, after dropping Kurumi at their house while creating some clones to watch out for her, Naruto slipped outside to check the condition of the town. When he reached the town, he saw that all of the town's populace has been gathered in the middle of town. Using chakra to climb up a nearby house, Naruto listened to what the bandit's leader was speaking about.</P><P>"...A bounty hunter named Arashi, from my information, was here, and has settled down here. I want all of you tell me where his location is, or I'll kill you one by one until he shows up. If you all were to die, then it would be of no consequence to me, and may all of your deaths would weigh on his consequence."</P><P>"What do you want with him?! Arashi-san has been very helpful to all of us! You will not gain anything from us!"</P><P>"Heh. Hahaahha! So, you didn't know about him didn't you? All of you! You have been lied to! That man is a bounty hunter! An A-ranked bounty as well! He is extremely good! And has a total bounty of 350,000 yen by everyone!"</P><P>Then, a scream was heard from behind everyone. "SHUT UP! DON'T YOU DARE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT HIM!" Naruto turned around, and saw that the person was Ichigo, holding the huge cleaver blade that he saw at the shop, the wrappings around the blade removed. The blade, is extremely impressive, a black back with a clear silver cutting edge.</P><P>"Oh. So you want to challenge me?" the ronin asked.</P><P>"Yeah! Now die!" Ichigo then rushed directly towards the ronin, sword at his back, ready to swing it to cleave the ronin in half. But the ronin, who also rushed to met his charge head on, just sidestepped Ichigo's charge by the barest margin, before sending a vicious hook to Ichigo's temple, sending him flying and knocked out with the blade flying away, and fell, stabbing the ground. The ronin then took out his sword.</P><P>"Do you want to see what happens to those who tried to oppose me?! Any of you!? None?! Then he will be the first sacrifice to call Arashi!"</P><P>He was about to swing his sword to decapitate Ichigo, when suddenly, a breeze came in, and Ichigo's blade was suddenly blocking the ronin's nodachi. The ronin's eyes widened for a bit, before a hooded figure stood up from behind the blade, eyes glowing with rage.</P><P>"So... You want to call me? Well then, here I am!" shouted Naruto while holding Ichigo's blade. Inwardly, he was admiring the quality of the blade. The blade may be large, but with his strength, Naruto had no problems at all wielding the blade. And there's a weird feeling coming from the blade that he cannot pinpoint.</P><P>"Well, well, well. So this is the famed A-class bounty hunter that everyone is talking about eh? So will you die on my hands, before I kill everyone in this town?"</P><P>Naruto did not answer. Instead, he just lifted the sword above his head, and disappeared from everyone's sight, before reappearing right in front of the ronin, slicing the sword downwards. The ronin, shocked from the sheer speed that Naruto displayed, didn't have the time to do anything before he was sliced in half from his shoulder to his hips. Still marvelling the blade in his hands due to its sheer sharpness, he then proceeds to massacre the bandits that was busy surrounding the villagers causing Naruto to bathe in blood, with the villagers close to the bandits also showered with blood from the bandit's bodies. The rest of the bandits tried to flee after seeing their leader's death, but they quickly got cut down by Naruto who appeared within their midst like a phantom. In just two minutes, the entire army of bandits are already dead, with the ground bathed in the bandits' blood.</P><P>While still covered in blood and gore, Naruto went in front of the villagers, before saying to the villagers. "Everyone! People of Karakura town! As you all know, my name is Arashi! The thing that everyone didn't know about me is that as the ronin said, I am a bounty hunter! And a damn good one if what he says about me is true! Now you all have seen my true colours! The reason why I'm in this town is to let my wife rest while her pregnancy is going! As you can just see, having a pregnant wife while living on the run is not a good idea! I won't be here for long, only until she gave birth, and at best about a month or two after that! So now I ask from all of you: would you like me to stay or should I leave? I will not hold this decision against all of you, and I will have no problem leaving, if such is your decision!"</P><P>The villagers, still huddled together, started whispering and discussing among themselves about him, while Naruto himself was going towards Ichigo, who has already woken up to the sight of Naruto's massacre of the bandits and the ronin. He then crouched in front of Ichigo while using his sword as a stand to hold his body. He then pulled the blade from the ground, before giving back to Ichigo. "here's your sword, kid. It's a good blade, and I'm sure it'll serve anyone that it wants to extremely well.</P><P>He then turned towards the villagers again and said "You don't have to give your decision today. I will have no problems accepting any of your choices, and will leave immediately if that's what you want."</P><P>But suddenly, a person rises up, and started to speak. "Arashi-san. Your presence here may bring danger. But," and he turned towards the villagers "have any of us saw him threatening our people? He even helped around town with his skills! Some of us are saved from animal attacks because of him! And during this bandit raid, did he ever hurt us?! Did he let us be captured and killed by the bandits just to save his own ass? No! He came at us, saved the town, and even saved young, brave but foolish Ichigo over there from sacrificing his life! We owe him our lives!"</P><P>"But he's the reason why they came in the first place!" a villager shouted.</P><P>"True! But as I said just now, did he leave us here, just to die to help his own ass? No! He even saved us, and would accept our decision as well! I for one want him to stay! Now who's with me?!"</P><P>Murmurs and chatting broke out among the freed villagers, with the sounds of "cute couple", "nice guy", and "have him stay" was heard by Naruto and his Lyman's Ear. After a while, a lot of the villagers stood up, and proclaimed that they want him to stay. The first villager that talked then said, "so, from the looks of it, I'd say that most of the people would like you to stay here. So continue your stay."</P><P>Naruto, hearing this, bowed towards the villagers, then stood up, and said "Thank you everyone. You will not regret this. I will pledge myself to act as the town's guardian while I'm here, and will guard all of you from any threat, either bandits or missing nins. Once again, I thank all of you. Let me clean up all these bandit corpse." And with that, Naruto created many clones, which picked up the bandit's corpses and piled them outside the town and proceeds to burn them using a Katon jutsu, before going back to his cabin and telling the story to Kurumi. Needless to say, Kurumi was extremely pissed that night, and told him to sleep outside, which he responds by whispering "...I didn't sleep anyway..."</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>It's the ninth month, and both Kurumi and Naruto are extremely excited, and was unable to hide the excitement of their soon-to-come child. Her stomach seems like it's about to blow, according to Naruto, and she kept going to the loo even more often nowadays -her womb is pressing her bladder, said the doc- and forces him to create a toilet close by to the house so that it is easier for her to walk to it. Also, mysteriously, the doctor says that she didn't show any signs that she's going to be in labour, even though it is already the final month of her pregnancy. This confuses the doctor, but even so, both the baby and Kurumi were doing fine, so he has nothing to say about it.</P><P>Meanwhile, Naruto's new task as the village guardian is simple : prevent any bandits or missing nin from entering or attacking the village, and even some wild animals rampaging from the plains, though this didn't happen much. Still, it's a job Naruto likes, and he has no problems doing it. Sometimes, he even acted as bodyguards during times when some of the village caravan needs an escort to a nearby town or anything else. It was a task that he really liked, and which he didn't mind, though his mind kept going back to his extremely pregnant wife almost all the time.</P><P>A month passed by, and the tenth month of the pregnancy came, and still no signs of any impending birth from Kurumi, which further puzzles Isshin to no end. None of his medical scrolls say that a pregnancy can last more than nine months and two weeks without any side effects to the mother, but hers was still going strong, and there are no problems at all with both mother and baby! Another mysterious puzzle from a mysterious pair.</P><P>Once the pair reached their home, Kurumi suddenly said "Naru-koi, I am tired, really, really tired. I have no idea why, and I didn't think I did anything to tire myself out. We haven't had sex for a while too, so no way I can be this tired, not without a reason" and sat herself down on a rocking chair that Naruto carved using his admittedly mediocre skill in carpentry. He was about to reply when what he saw at Kurumi shocked him. Kurumi suddenly, and mysteriously, had chakra exhaustion. Chakra Exhaustion! Kurumi had as much chakra as two Kages, and she had chakra exhaustion!</P><P>Surprised, Naruto immediately said to Kurumi "Kurumi-koi, it seems that you have a bad case of chakra exhaustion! That almost sounds impossible, but you really do!" Naruto observed her chakra flow further, and realised something even weirder. Kurumi was absorbing nature chakra, but they didn't circulate within her body, but instead, it flows within her chakra core, before disappearing. Also, the purified bijuu chakra, which she has 8 tails of them already, with its core, instead of being located at the stomach like a regular chakra core, is situated at the area between the two chests at the place where the trachea splits, and its colour being bright gold. This chakra was also absorbed into her chakra core and disappeared. "Not just that, the purified chakra is moving to your chakra core and disappears! Your body is also absorbing nature chakra around us, and is doing the same!"</P><P>"What? But how? I would've known if I were to use the purified chakra, and I'll feel it if I were to absorb nature chakra! And chakra exhaustion? That sounds almost impossible! I haven't used a jutsu in months! But wait. Maybe the baby's absorbing it?"</P><P>"That's a possibility, but one that we have no method of proving. So for now, I guess that we'll just have to wait and see what happens. Or maybe... here, let me try something." Naruto then pulls a bit of the purified chakra into his hands, and places his hands on her stomach. To both their surprise, the gold chakra from his hands was absorbed into her stomach almost immediately, confirming their suspicions about the baby absorbing their chakra, though for what reason, they didn't know.</P><P>Another month passes, and the eleventh month of pregnancy arrives. During this month, the ever-confused doctor gets even more confused when the couple came in for a check up with Kurumi looking like she just ran across the whole Elemental Nations! Excepting her extreme tiredness – chakra exhaustion, said Arashi-san – everything was fine as a whistle, though the length of the pregnancy is extremely bizarre, but now she was starting to get minor contractions, and she felt the baby turn, usual signs of an impending labour which he warned the couple about. Arashi then proceeds to give him a weird looking weapon, a three pronged kunai with a paper wrapped around the hilt with weird markings on it and told him to keep it at him at all times. Her chakra was still being absorbed by the baby, making her perpetually tired and edgy. Even her purified chakra was absorbed by the baby, while Naruto kept supplying his to the baby as well.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>It is almost the end of the twelfth moth of her pregnancy when she felt a powerful contraction came, which causes her to almost fell from her standing position onto the floor. She then immediately went and took one Hirashin kunai and flooded the seal with chakra and threw it close by, with Naruto appearing almost immediately on top of the kunai.</P><P>"Kurumi-koi, are you alright?"</P><P>"The baby's coming! I can feel it! Take us to the doctor, fast"</P><P>Naruto, not trusting his voice, just nodded, lifted her bridal style and Hiraishined in front of the doctor who was luckily not doing anything at the moment while shouting "Doc! My wife's in labour! What should I do?!"</P><P>Isshin, surprised out of his mind when Naruto appeared out of thin air, immediately went into doctor mode, and seeing Kurumi's pained face, immediately told Naruto to place her on a bed in the maternity ward, and told him to stay by his wife. After doing just that, he sat beside his wife while holding her hand tightly. "Don't worry. We'll get through this. Stay calm." He said.</P><P>More contractions came by, and her face seems like she was holding a massive amount of pain, before suddenly, a burst of liquid came between her legs, which causes Naruto to jump, screaming "Her water broke! Her water broke!"</P><P>After a while, Isshin came in with his daughters, Yuzu and Karin who acts as nurses for the clinic, and started preparing to deliver her baby, prepping gauzes, hot water, and a lot of other things that will be needed during the delivery.</P><P>Suddenly, her contractions started getting stronger and stronger, and her vaginal opening has grown enough that the baby can be delivered, and the team starts to stand by to receive the baby.</P><P>"Alright, when you feel the contractions, start pushing! The baby will come out, and we will be there to receive him or her!"</P><P>She then starts pushing in rhythm with her contractions. Luckily for her, the delivery is donw in a short while, and no complications are seen. But then Naruto heard the nurses talking "The baby is out! But... what's this?"</P><P>Naruto, hearing that, went ahead and looked at the baby. What he saw both shocked and made him felt happier than any other moment in his short life. The baby, a girl, had a thin layer of blonde hair, blue eyes like her mother, round face, and most importantly, seven flowing golden, white tipped fox tails flowing from behind her and two tiny fox ears with the same colours on her head, currently bathed in amniotic fluids. He immediately told the doctor and nurses "Just ignore the ears and tails first. Clean her up, and give her to her mother." They immediately complied, cleaned her up and wrapped her in a blanket, while Kurumi is pushing out the placenta from within her.</P><P>They then brought her to Kurumi, who was tired from the ordeal of delivering her child. She then immediately took the child, looked at her, and cried.</P><P>"Naruto, this is our child, our baby. The first of the new generations... And her name is Kushina. Uzumaki-Namikaze Kushina. I always liked her you know, Kushina-chan. I hoped that she can continue her grandmother's legacy in everything." Is all that she managed to speak, before emotions overwhelmed her, and she started crying heavily. Naruto, holding back his tears at first, then joined on the heartwarming moment, and hugged Kurumi together with Kushina, who started to slowly coo, and immediately started brestfeeding on Kurumi's breasts.</P><P>"Hey Kurumi-koi, look. She recognizes her mother. Will she be able to recognize me?" he then turned towards Kushina, and said "Kushina-chan, this is your father here speaking. I don't know if you can recognize me right now, you might be too small to know. But I will be here for you, and will always be there for you."</P><P>Kurumi, already crying from the sight, started crying even harder, and said "Kushina-chan, you will be a great child, I can see it. You will be a strong child, a strong warrior, and a strong woman in your life. You will not let any other people harm your family, while also guarding our honour. Your power is great, even as a child and you will be taught how to control them, among others. Do not let anyone tell you that being a bijuu hanyou is bad, they are just jealous of your powers. Enough of that, I guess we'll see each other later."</P><P>She then gave her daughter back to Naruto, who kissed her forehead and gave her to the doctor, who cleans her up further before applying some postbirth medicinal herbs to Kushina and some herbal drinks to Kurumi to help her with any post delivery problems, though they saw that her wounds and all are already healing at a rapid rate, causing them to wonder what she actually is, especially when they saw that the child has tails and fox ears, while both Naruto and Kurumi did not. But before they can even ask anything, Naruto quickly applied a special seal on all those involved in the delivery that modifies their memory, making them lose the memory about the ears and tails, and places another seal on Kushina, which forces her to enter her full human form immediately, effectively hiding the fact that she is a hanyou from everyone.</P><P>And that is how the newest member of the Uzumaki-Namikaze family came to be... Though Naruto's challenges have just started, and a child will add even more spice to his already fucked up life in the future...</P><P>-CHAPTER END-</P><P>Whew! And here comes Kushina Jr.! I tried making the post delivery scene a pretty emotional one (I remembered CLANNAD's birth scene (CLANNAD fans know which one) at all time while writing that scene). I hope I succeeded. So everyone, please read and review! Any review that helps point out my mistakes are very much appreciated! See you next time, on the next chapter of A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel!</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>Hello everybody! This is later than my previous updates, I know. But please do me a favour and remember the notification Hello everybody! This is later than my previous updates, I know. But please do me a favour and remember the notification that I placed at the beginning of the story. Now enough talk, read the new chapter of A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel!</P><P>CHAPTER 5: KUSHINA'S GROWTH AND BACK TO KONOHA</P><P>-CHAPTER START-</P><P>Even when she was just hours old, the doctors already know that the child that was born recently, named Kushina, was a special child. For once, she didn't sleep, unlike other babies. Her eyes are always open, always alert, tracking everything that she sees with minute movements of her eyeballs. Also, she didn't cry, not once! A baby that didn't sleep will usually cry out for their mothers, but Kushina didn't so much even whimper! Also, her skin is extremely different. It felt much tougher than regular baby skin, though is still soft to the touch. She didn't seem to have any problems with following the movement of everything, even something that came from her back. Her head just turned around to follow the movement of the object or person behind her, like she can see from the top of her head or something. Perplexed, Yuzu tried asking Arashi about the baby's weird skills, which he answers "Don't worry about that. We're just like that. It's better off if you bring her to her mother." Which Yuzu immediately followed.</P><P>Upon reaching her mother, who although was already healed almost completely, was still in the ward for further observation, she immediately cooed and stretched her tiny hands to her mother's face. Kurumi, seeing this, immediately started picking up her daughter and started breastfeeding her. Yuzu then left to give the couples some privacy.</P><P>Upon seeing that Yuzu has left, Naruto started to speak. "I guess the bloodline really is inherited to her well. No sleeping, tough skin, stronger senses, though we still need to think on when to start giving her the iron powder for her growth and strong bones."</P><P>"True. We must start giving her the iron dust supplements fast, because her bones cannot grow to their maximum strength without any stronger materials, and iron is the best that we have so far. And since I cannot eat iron, unlike you and Kushina here, we need to feed it to her directly. Hopefully she can eat them well, or we are all screwed."</P><P>"Don't worry. She won't be hurt that badly, and I know that we can wait for a while before she starts to really need the iron dust for her bones. Anyway, how's her strength?"</P><P>"I can tell you that she feeds a lot. I haven't had too much of a chance to wait until my milk glands refill themselves, so I am forced to use chakra to augment the milk glands' milk production. She really likes to eat."</P><P>"Can't help that, I guess. It runs in the family, you know." Hearing this, Kurumi just smiled, while she continued feeding Kushina. After a while, Kushina stops sucking Kurumi's tit for milk, and just looked at her father expectantly. Naruto saw this, and lifted her up from her mother's arms, and atrted making baby noises to his daughter, who just laughed in response. But then Naruto tried to give her back to the nurse, she started crying, and started to struggle in her blanket, thus not allowing the nurse to hold her. "So, you want to stay with your mom eh?" Naruto said, before giving her back to Kurumi, when she suddenly stopped crying. "I guess she really knows that you're her mother."</P><P>All the nurses just awwwww'ed at this show of love between a newborn child and her mother. It also helps that Kushina's round face, blue eyes and tufts of blonde hair just makes her look cuter, which causes the nurses to love playing with her round, whisker marked cheeks.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>After a week, both Kurumi and Kushina are cleared to leave the clinic, though both of them have healed nicely a long time ago. Upon reaching their cabin, Naruto immediately removed the seal on Kushina, causing her seven glorious tails and her two fox ears to pop out and moving about, causing her to become entranced with the swinging movement of her own tails, which she then played with, sucking on them, and looked at them moving. Meanwhile, Naruto and Kurumi are discussing something about Kushina.</P><P>"Love, I know that the Biscopea and the Ossmodula secrete growth hormones and thus causing rapid growth, but for Kushina-chan to be able to grab her tails, track their movements, even doing a lot of complex stuff! I may have not seen too much babies, but I am sure that such a growth rate would still be too fast!"</P><P>"Relax, Naru-koi. Also, she's the first child in the world with your bloodline, and the first bijuu hanyou child. It makes sense that you are worried. So am I, but all those are normal, I'm sure."</P><P>"*sighs* Alright, if you say so. I'm sure that there is nothing wrong with her, but maybe I'm just worried. We will leave this town in a month or so anyway. So, it's better for us not to become too attached to her."</P><P>"Yeah. I think that's for the best as well. Now, it's better off for us to just enter our house, and hope that nothing's wrong."</P><P>Naruto and Kurumi then started to walk towards their temporary home, while thinking of the future that they both are going to go through...</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>One month has passed since they are discharged, and they have started to feed Kushina solids. And by solids, it means liquefied raw animal meat mixed with some earth and iron dust that Naruto gained from the smithy. This is to help her growth, and also to help her bones become tougher and denser, just like Naruto's did. She accepted the food greedily, with the weird concoction spoon fed into her mouth. The problem nowadays is that sometimes, she cannot control her Betcher's Glands well, causing her to drool acid sometimes, melting the flooring and her clothes. Their baby supplies are immediately exhausted due to the acidic drool, which causes Naruto to curse the organ sometimes. But surprisingly, the acidic drool never came during anytime else, expect during feeding time, which makes Naruto think that the acidic drool only came when she realises that she's going to eat. The acidic drool also gave another problem, in that their house's collection of spoons need to be replaced almost every day, since her saliva melted all of them to slag, which gave Naruto another headache, but that's what you get when you're taking care of a baby, especially a baby with superhuman capabilities.</P><P>Her hanyou characteristics are also a bit problematic sometimes, now that she can control them well. She usually swings her tail around, disregarding everything around her, causing her tails to crash into everything : bottles, chairs, her blanket wraps, even sometimes unmaking the futon that she slept on. Combining that with her inability to sleep, and you get an extremely energetic superhuman child. Her ears are also much more sensitive than her human ears, even when her human ears are enhanced ears, the Lyman's Ears, which causes her to move her head around to track everything that she heard, which was pretty much everything. This causes Naruto a lot of headache, especially when feeding her because her head kept turning around everywhere, spilling the liquid food everywhere. And she still eats a lot, and still needs a very long breastfeeding time, which causes Naruto to think that she will grow up fast, very fast.</P><P>Also, another thing that Naruto found out was that when he approaches her with the purified chakra being used or just placed on his hands, her own purified chakra sprang forwards in a golden flaming cloak around her body, which causes Naruto to think that it was actually a self defence mechanism by her Linker Core to activate the cloak when she detects a huge danger, or just that the same type of purified chakra attracts another. This forced activation of her chakra cloak causes her to activate it, just for fun sometimes, because Naruto saw that she laughs more when the cloak was activated, maybe because of the abundance of life energy flowing within the cloak. Her laughs really acted like a massive surge of aspirin to Naruto and Kurumi, causing all their pains and headaches to fly away instantly.</P><P>And during the checkups to the doctor, they are forced to hide her tails and ears, which causes her to cry, maybe because her favourite toy was gone, which sometimes causes her to activate her chakra cloak. Luckily, Naruto has already thought of this problem, and placed a huge amount of chakra suppression seals on her blanket so that her massive chakra surge will not be detected by the entire Elemental Nations. Also, during those checkups, Isshin was confused with the kid. She may be extremely young, but she has eyes that can see him no matter where he goes, hears everything he said, and he had that nagging feeling that says that she was targeting him, but for what is still a mystery for him.</P><P>She was also, according to his checks, a bit too healthy. A regular child will have some problems during their first month, but she never had those problems. No shortness of breath, no fever, no nothing! She didn't even cry! The only time she cried was when she was separated from either her mother or her father, and she eats a lot! Much, much more than even toddlers age three! In the end, Isshin just chalked it up to 'weird ninja bloodline shit' (Oh, how right he was) and just said that the kid's all fine and dandy, and nothing's wrong with both the mother and the daughter.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Another month passed, and Kushina, ever the hyperactive child, has started to crawl and speak baby speak, which brings even more headache to her parents. Now that she can crawl, she likes to crawl all over the house, ears flapping, tails flaring and sometimes, just breaking stuff up due to her strength. It seems that the muscles built by the growth hormones secreted by the Biscopea aren't just for show. So, Naruto decided to begin Kushina's training early, by tattooing her body with a myriad of self adjusting seals like the ones he had, like the auto adjusting gravity and resistance seals. Besides, that might also help slow her down a bit. Her hyperactivity, the result of not having to sleep and massively increased energy productions due to the Multi-lung, Haemastamen and the Catalepsean Node, was starting to annoy Naruto. So, one day, with the help of Kurumi, who agreed with the idea as well, Naruto started painting the seals on Kushina's body, who just felt ticklish, until Naruto activates the seals. She then started to cry, probably due to her increased resistance, causing her to have less freedom than before. Naruto felt guilty at this, but knows that it's for her own good. And his own peace. Kurumi, seeing this, felt sympathetic towards her, lifted her into her arms while shooting a nasty glare towards Naruto, who ignored it. Kurumi then tried calming Kushina, whose tails were already feeling lifeless and down, while she was bawling her eyes out.</P><P>Sadly for Naruto, her body adjusts to the seals at a very rapid pace, courtesy of her Uzumaki heritage and the Larraman's Organ together with the Biscopea. She was crawling around without a care in the world in days, causing a neverending source of headache towards Naruto. But one day, something happened that causes Naruto to cry in joy.</P><P>One day, Naruto just got back from training, and Kurumi was sleeping inside her private rocking chair (which she plans to take as well when they leave the town) and Kushina was crawling around, chasing her tails. Then, hearing Naruto's heavy footsteps from afar, she immediately crawled towards the cabin's door, waited until Naruto opened the door, before saying "Papa!" when she saw Naruto.</P><P>Naruto, hearing this, was shocked. lifting Kushina into his hands, he immediately said "What was that Kushi-chan? Say that again." Kushina, ever wanted to impress her parents, immediately says "Papa! Papa!" while trying to grab Naruto's whisker marked face. Naruto then ran and woke Kurumi up.</P><P>"Kurumi-koi! Kurumi-koi! Listen to this! *turns towards Kushina in his arms* Kushi-chan, who's this?"</P><P>"Papa! Mama!" she said while pointing towards each of her parents.</P><P>Kurumi, still groggy at first, became fully awake when she heard her child's melodious voice. "Kushi-chan can speak! Kushi-chan speaks!"</P><P>Kushina, looking at her parents' happiness, started to laugh happily which causes Naruto and Kurumi to cry tears of joy, and all three of them hugged together, and their bond to become stronger. And from then on, Naruto knows that no matter what, he will never be able to hate his child.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>It's Kushina's third month, and they are still staying around Karakura, but many changes have occurred. Due to the quality of Naruto's forging, he was taught by the old man Kagerou the ways of sword forging a couple of months ago, and using his strength, stamina, learning speed, and his keen eyes, he managed to create swords that are of excellent quality, so much so that Kagerou's forge was suddenly famous all over. Combine that with the relative peace of Karakura, it causes the population of the town to grow, and the economy as well to grow. This causes Isshin, who was the only doctor in town, to gain a massive headache because supplies are dwindling, though he could still keep up with the people around town.</P><P>Another change was with Kushina. She, now capable of walking, has started to follow Naruto when he was leaving the cabin, thus forcing Naruto to close the door early, leaving her at home, and causing her to throw a tantrum around the place while crying, forcing Kurumi to calm her down. But, even now, they have started to pack all their stuff to leave, and start another journey. Naruto was bringing Kushina to a check up when the question was asked.</P><P>"She's all fine and well, and her body's working excellently. She didn't have any diseases, not even allergies and she seemed capable of talking a little already. She's all grown up now. I mean, she grows up faster than any other child I've ever seen. Not to mention these growth rates are more like a one year old kid than a 3 month old baby. But I guess that's all your weird ninja crap stuff."</P><P>"Yeah, I guess. Can't be helped though. You have an awesome father, thus your child will be awesome as well." Naruto said, while watching Kushina playing with the nurses around the clinic. With her Astartes constitution, the nurses are unable to catch her, with her running faster than they can, or even prying herself from the nurses' grips, causing the chase to begin anew. But she was an attraction to the nurses. Her cheerful disposition, her huge amounts of energy, her cute, whisker marked cheeks (which the nurses liked to scratch and pull), causes the nurses to like playing with her a lot when she's here and when there are no important cases around.</P><P>Isshin scoffs, before he continued. "So you said that you'll leave when she's two months old right? But now she's three, and you didn't seem like you're going to leave soon."</P><P>"Well, actually, I already packed and ready to move, only waiting for this last check up from you, and to visit Kagerou before leaving in the night."</P><P>"Well, I'm gonna miss you, you know. So will the kids. They liked playing with your kid, and they will miss her when you're gone."</P><P>"Heh. Then just hope that we'll meet again, and that they'll be there to meet her."</P><P>"Sure will. Now get out of here." Naruto just chuckled, picked Kushina up, and went to the next place that he needs to go: Old Man Kagerou's smithy. Upon reaching the place, he immediately went inside to look for both Ichigo and Kagerou, and he saw them at the forge, with Kagerou teaching Ichigo sword smithing.</P><P>"Hey there old man. And Ichigo." He started while placing Kushina down, who immediately started running everywhere, and unseen to everyone, picks up some iron dust that she found on the ground and eats them.</P><P>"Hey." Replied Ichigo and Kagerou, who both stopped their forging activities, and turned to look Naruto in the eyes.</P><P>"As you both know, I have overextended my stay in this village, and I am planning to leave with my family tonight, continuing the life of an adventurer. You can't say anything to stop me, and you won't. So, I am here to thank both of you for teaching me your forging skills while letting me earn my keep here."</P><P>Naruto was about to turn around and leave, when Ichigo says "Arashi, wait." And went inside. Confused, Naruto just did as ordered, before widening his eyes at what Ichigo held in his hands, which was the cleaver blade that he used the other day, before it got blown away by the ronin.</P><P>"Arashi, I want you to have this. You have spilled blood with it, and according to our tradition, you owned the blade. This is a very special blade, Arashi. May it helps you in your travels as it does to me."</P><P>"Wait. What do you mean by tradition?"</P><P>"My dad was once a swordsman, while my mother, Masaki, was a swordsmith. They both then fell in love with each other when they met at this shop, with my dad being a customer and my mom the smith in charge at the time. Kagerou was actually my grandpa. It was a love at first sight. They later married, and she gave birth to 3 children, me Karin and Yuzu. But sadly, even with her children, she hasn't stopped her dream: to forge the ultimate sword. And one day, she found a forbidden technique that she gained from her dream. It says, that to forge the ultimate blade, a sacrifice must be given to the steel, so that the sacrifice will become its own power. And so, one day, she left out of the house during the dead of night to fulfil the criteria. And in the morning, when grandpa went to the forge, there is already a huge vat of boiling steel, with a letter beside it. The letter says that my mother had sacrificed herself within the boiling chakra conducting steel from the Land of Iron that she has saved money for years to buy. Our entire family cried that day, except Old Man Kagerou. Instead of crying in front of her grave, what he did was that he started to use the molten metal within the vat, and used it to forge this blade, his best creation ever. Somehow, the blade is made of a huge vat of molten chakra conducting steel as tall as a person, yet the size is only so, and the blade itself is not that heavy, though it never dulls, never requires any maintenance, and is extremely sharp, as you can see. The blade was then hung at the front of the shop as a memento of my mother, and my dad swore that he will never lift up a sword again, and uses his knowledge later to open the clinic."</P><P>"Then I can never take the blade! It is a memento of your mother! In fact, looking at it from another perspective, the blade IS your mother! I cannot take it!"</P><P>"The tradition of my mom's family's forging style is that if a blade was bloodied, then the one who bloodies it will be its owner. Besides, my mom has managed to achieve her ambition of making the greatest sword in history, and I think she did just that. Letting it act as a decoration on the wall will not make her feel good, and it's better off at the hands of a trained warrior. And you used it to save my life, thus I'm sure she'll approve. Also, dad won't use the sword, not just because of his oath, but because it brings back memories of her, who's a very loving wife and mother, if you didn't include her obsession with forging the ultimate sword. I insist. Take it. I'm sure you can use it better than I ever will."</P><P>"...Alright. if you insist." Naruto then took the blade and places it on its special chain-like holder at his back, during which he found out that the wrapping can be controlled by chakra, and thus he wraps it around the blade, acting like a makeshift sheath.</P><P>"Ichigo." Ichigo, who was on the way to the back of the shop, turned around, and saw that Naruto was bowing from the waist, his body parallel to the ground. "Thank you. I will treasure this sword forever." And then, he stood up straight, before leaving the smithy. Ichigo sighs, says "You better, or I'll track you down and kill you myself." And left to continue his task at the back of the shop.</P><P>That night, witnessed only by the moon and the stars, Naruto destroys the cabin using a specially made exploding tag that he created, and removes any signs of their presence at the place where they once lived for almost a year. With Kushina sitting within her mother's arms, they left the town of Karakura under the cover of night, never to be seen there again, until sometime later.</P><P>"So, where's our next destination?" Kurumi asked. Since they are leaving without any planning or thought, they have not thought of any plan of movement to spend some time until they wante to return to Konoha.</P><P>"Hmm... I guess that we'll do the same that we did before, that is by just walking around without too much of a destination until we found a town to take missions at, and stay there for a while. Or do we have any other plans?"</P><P>"What about if we were to travel as always, but towards Whirlpool Country? There might still be some secrets within the ruins of Uzu, and with your Uzumaki blood, there might just be some more secrets there that can only be unlocked by an Uzumaki." Kurumi suggested.</P><P>"That actually sounds like a pretty good idea. Well, I guess it's better than nothing." Naruto agrees. But then, he saw Kurumi yawning, and said "But you're already sleepy, and we have just been out of Karakura's outskirts in two hours. How about if I were to carry you and let you sleep on my back, while a Shadow Clone carry Kushina? That way, we can maintain travelling speed even throughout the whole night, and speeding up our travel time."</P><P>"*yawns* I guess that's a good idea. Alright. Get your ass down here. You're too tall, and I can't just climb up your back."</P><P>Naruto just laughs, but what she said was true. His 6'7", 319 kg body was not something that can be climbed without any help. He then creates a Shadow Clone which took Kushina and places her on his shoulders with her legs around his head. The original than had Kurumi on his back, with him holding her legs beneath his armpits. He then starts to run after asking whether or not everyone was holding on well. Kurumi started to sleep on his back, while Kushina was screaming in excitement due to the ride her dad was giving her. Naruto then laughed together with her, and both just enjoyed their journey, but in different ways.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Two months had passed after they left the town, and Kushina, now five months old, has grown as well. Eating pretty much anything she gets her hands on, she gained a weird combination of nutrients, at least from what Kurumi said on what she eats. She can already walk like a pro, while also grabbing her hands on anything she could. She ate the stuff that she grabs too most of the time. Some of the lists of thing that she ate were soil, grass, small trees, tree bark, bugs, tiny animals that she managed to catch, rusted kunais, broken glasses among others. This may sound disgusting to other people, but her Astartes bloodline's constitution allows her to eat all of that stuff and even extract them for her body. Any injuries that she sustains are healed near instantly, and she never got stuck with any diseases. And now that she could speak a little, she starts to point to everything and asked her dad to teach her. Naturally Naruto, being the caring, loving father that he is, always answered.</P><P>Also, her muscles are growing as well. Naruto found this the hard way when she got too excited at one time and smacked his head, which felt like a blow from a bandit! And she's just five months old! The combination of gravity and resistance seals and the Biscopea's own muscular growth enhances causes her to gain the muscle strength of an adult this early in her life, which causes Naruto to feel worried on what will happen against those who wants to mess with her when she's bigger.</P><P>But one day, something happened to them that caused Naruto to feel a bit worried for not just their family, but also anyone who she encounters later. One day, while they are walking towards the general direction of Whirlpool, they are ambushed by 15 bandits. Thinking that they have the advantage in numbers, and due to the fact that one of them was just a child, the bandit leader started feeling braver and started to shout to the Uzumaki-Namikazes.</P><P>"Stop and surrender all your belongings! Or we will kill you!" he shouted, while the rest of the bandits start to close in to the Uzumaki-Namikaze's location. "Or maybe we can take your wife as a slave, and your daughter as well. After we killed you, of course." He said, while sending a perverted leer towards Kurumi. To Naruto, harming him was one thing, but even thinking of harming his family was another. He immediately rushed the bandit leader and punched him square in the face, crushing his face to paste, leaving nothing resembling a face with his blood pouring out of every hole on his not-quite face. The rest of the bandits, seeing this, tried to run away, but Naruto managed to kill nearly all of them, except one.</P><P>This one bandit, thinking of looking for a hostage, ran towards Kurumi and Kushina, his makeshift blade held to try to gut them both. Suddenly, Kushina jumped out of Kurumi's hands, and ran straight at the man, who stopped suddenly due to the sheer absurdity of what was happening in front of him, before Kushina ran between his legs, and bit his thigh with her mouth, trained by constantly chewing on rocks, metal and trees. The man then screamed in agony, while Kushina ripped the flesh piece that she just bit while chewing it. Everyone in the area, except for Kushina and the bandit, had their jaws on the ground, while the bandit was screaming even more when he realises that his flesh was being burned by the acidic saliva that Kushina was producing. Kushina then swallowed the piece of meat that she's chewing, before walking back slowly towards the bandit. The bandit, seeing the demonic child coming at him, probably to finish the job, screamed "Go away! Go away! Don't come closer!" while swinging his makeshift blade towards Kushina, who dodged it easily, before going to his neck, and bit off his jugular. The bandit then let off a death gurgle, before he slumps, dead. Kushina, seeing that her prey was dead, went to the guy's head, and tore his skull off, causing his brain to show, which she promptly eats.</P><P>Naruto and Kurumi both had their jaw firmly on the ground by now, when suddenly, Kushina screamed in pain, which snapped them out of their stupor, before they both ran towards her, who was grabbing her head, which seems to be in massive pain while tears are pouring from her eyes. They then hugged her, whispering soothing words into her ears, before she suddenly fell asleep, her body still covered with the bandit's blood, tar tracks on her face. Naruto and Kurumi then looked at each other, and back to Kushina, and back to each other, before Kurumi spoke, "I think it's best for us to break camp here now."</P><P>Naruto just nodded, and prepared to open their camp, and places the necessary complement of seals, before he decided to talk to Kurumi about Kushina.</P><P>"Kurumi-koi, what was that about? Why did she eat that bandit? Not that they didn't deserve it, but that was really uncalled for! And she instinctively ate the brains of the guy too! What's up with that?"</P><P>"Naru-koi, that... I do not know, but the best I have is theories."</P><P>"Then let's hear them."</P><P>"...Well, like it or not, she, as well as both of us, are hanyous now. Bijuu hanyous. As hanyou, we have both our demonic side and our human side. But due to the fact that we became hanyous older, and that we can already control our instinct, we did not feel the presence of the demonic side. But for her, a child born with not just massive power, but also a demonic side to her that is mostly instinctive and natural, she ended up following what her instincts say instead of a human's common sense."</P><P>"Then why did she aim straight for the brain? Even I only do that when it is utterly necessary or when I hunt a missing nin, since they had information. Why did she do that?" Naruto, pretty much a veteran of hunting missing nins, had a treasure trove of knowledge from other villages within his mind, ready to be unleashed at any moment.</P><P>"This is probably due to her demonic side knowing just what she has and is capable of using it to its maximum capability. That is the only probable theory that I have. Never would've thought that the bloodline, combined with us being hanyous, would lead to such a problem."</P><P>"This also means that any of our descendants, and their descendants, will all have this problem right?"</P><P>"Yes, and it must be tempered from the start. I'd say that we've been doing a good job at it so far considering that she only had the feral outbreak just now."</P><P>"True. And maybe-" Naruto's talk was cut short with the sound of Kushina groaning in pain, and waking up. Seeing her mother and father watching her intently, she speaks. "Mama? Papa?"</P><P>"Kushina! Oh thank the Sage you're alright!" says Kurumi, who immediately ran towards her and hugged her while showering her with kisses. Naruto also ran at her, doing the same. Kushina just giggled, and said "Mama! Papa! Hug!"</P><P>"*giggles* Yes Kushina, mama and papa are hugging you. You like it?"</P><P>"Yes! Hug good!"</P><P>Releasing the hug, Naruto then held Kushina's shoulders, and said to her. "Kushina-chan, do you know what you did to that bandit?"</P><P>"Man...eat?"</P><P>"Yes, you just ate a man. Do NOT, I repeat, do NOT, do that again, you hear me?"</P><P>"Cannot...eat man?"</P><P>"Yes. You cannot eat man. Eat other things, other animals, but not other man. Remember that."</P><P>"...Okay..." she said with a disappointed tone, signalling her displeasure at making her father angry.</P><P>"Kushina, remember that I will always love you. Anything that I tell you is for your own good. Unless you are big enough, then you cannot do that. Understand?"</P><P>"...Okay..."</P><P>Naruto just sighs, and let go of his daughter's shoulders. He then proceeds to start his nightly training session again, when a scream of "Kushina-chan!" from Kurumi makes her turn. What he saw shocked him to his core. Kushina, now in the form of a seven-tailed fox kit with golden fur, ran into the nearby forest, probably to vent.</P><P>"Wait, she can do that?!" Naruto asked/shouted.</P><P>"Well, it's probably instinctive! Go get her now!"</P><P>Naruto just nodded, before he felt the presence of the Hiraishin seal he placed on Kushina together with her gravity and resistance seals, so that he can come to her help at any moment, and Hiraishined towards her location. What he saw at her location made his heart break. Kushina was curled in a ball, her seven tails all wrapped around her, while her head was tucked in the middle of the ball, with tears from her face. Naruto then went towards her and hugged her fox form, causing the fox's tears to flow even more.</P><P>"Kushina-chan, I am not angry at you, because like it or not, you WILL have to eat someone in the future. But I was hoping that it is in the future, not because of what you did instinctively, so that you know what to do about it, and people's stigma at those who eats other's flesh. Please, stop crying Kushina-chan, because I am not angry with you."</P><P>The kit then whimpered, before her tears completely dried up, though she still had that sad look on her face. Smiling at her, Naruto brought her back towards the camp, where Kurumi immediately jumped her, not even waiting for Naruto to let her go.</P><P>"Oh my baby! Please forgive mama if I hurt you! I don't meant to hurt you!" she cried, while Kushina transforms back into her hanyou form and hugs her mother with her tiny, but deceptively strong hands. Naruto, watching this scene, cried, not just because of the scene itself, but also because he remembered his own childhood, and his promise that he will be there to guide his children, through thick and thin, even through the gates of hell itself if it falls to it.</P><P>A couple of days later, Naruto and Kurumi found out that just like their child, they can also freely enter one of three forms without side effects : their human form, their hanyou form (human with tails and fox ears replacing regular ears, while still retaining all the functionalities of their bloodline) and their full demon form, with the sizes adjustable. Naruto also found out that each forms has their bonuses. The human form gives more control over power but with less power, the hanyou form gives more power but less control, and the demon form gives much more power, but much less control, and is only probably good against an entire army. Also, the characteristics of his Astartes bloodline still remain no matter in what form.</P><P>Also, with Kushina having eaten the bandit's brain, she gained the bandit's knowledge, which allows her to recognize words, and not having to learn them, just needed to hear them once, before she can speak the word. She also learned a couple of other stuff, like basic survival skill and general herb knowledge, which reduces the amount of things that Naruto has to teach her, though her new tendency to enter her demon form and go hunting, probably to remove excess energy, was extremely annoying. In order for her to stop transforming into her demon form when they are in the middle of a village, he applies a seal to her body that forces her to remain in her human form, causing her to pout and threw a tantrum the first time it's done.</P><P>Both Naruto and Kurumi also trained with their demon and hanyou form. They also discovered that even if they turned into their full demon form, they can still use their jutsus, albeit consuming more chakra due to the fact that they cannot properly use handsigns in their demon form. They also found out that even in their demon form, they will use regular chakra, but with a hint of the purified chakra, and that the purified chakra will only be used when they activated it. Also, a Shadow Clone made during demon form stays in demon form. In fact, the clone itself can change forms at will, and can also activate their own purified chakra. Thus, with that, they both started their training in their demon form, to increase their battle prowess with it.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Two more months and after a long time of walking through Hot Springs Country, they finally managed to reach the docks that was said to have a ferry to Kiri, and what was once Uzushiogakure. Naruto, Kurumi and Kushina, still in their human form, went to meet the ticketing counter that handles the ferry. The woman manning the counter wasn't even looking at them, too busy counting today's ticket sales.</P><P>"Hello there miss. We would like to have some tickets to go to the ruins of Uzu. Are there still any left?"</P><P>The woman was about to tell him off when she looked up, and saw a giant of a man with his daughter on his shoulders with his wife, who was also pretty tall, standing in front of her. Feeling afraid of this giant, she stuttered out her answer. "N-n-no sir, the trip to Uzu is n-n-no m-more."</P><P>Naruto sighed. His current looks, 6'7" tall, 319 kg body of pure, well trained muscle, with his hood up to cover his face, a grey cloak at his back, while wearing an orange armoured jacket that he created himself and black pants with orange lining at the sides really intimidates people that didn't deserve or want to be intimidated. Or maybe, he just exudes an aura that screams "BADASS!". He just didn't have any idea why that happens, but it usually causes him to be feared for no reason. Sighing again, Naruto said to the woman again.</P><P>"Miss, will you be so kind to tell us why the trip to Uzu was cancelled?"</P><P>"R-r-right. After the d-d-destruction of Uzu, t-t-the whirlpools s-s-surrounding the i-island have n-never d-d-died, t-thus nobody w-wants to go t-t-there, which causes us t-to stop the trip t-t-there." she stuttered out.</P><P>Naruto thanked the woman and left, thinking of a way to go to Uzu.</P><P>"<I>I think water walking all the way to Uzu is the best way to go there, but what about the whirlpools? Does it need Uzumaki blood or something? There is no way for us to go there on a boat, thus the only viable way to go is by walking there, or by flying, something that even with my mastery over elemental chakra, I still cannot perform. So I guess walking would be the way."</I> Naruto thought. He then told Kurumi about his plan, and which she agrees, and says that the whirlpools will be done with once they got there.</P><P>He then went to a secluded area before checking their identity concealing seals that he places around all their clothes, something that gains him a name in the bingo book, but no face to attach it to, causing bounty hunters to get frustrated on finding him. After making sure that the seals are all attached and well, and they are ready to leave, Naruto immediately went straight onto the sea, and walked straight towards Uzu, by which he only have a general direction of, and nothing but the stars to guide him.</P><P>After a non-stop run of 3 days with Kurumi on his back and Kushina on his clone's back, Naruto managed to reach an area where massive whirlpools are blocking the entrance to the area. Looking at the sheer size of the whirlpools, which was around 1kilometer in diameter at the largest, it makes him wonder how did this land, the lands of his ancestors, well protected by their location and the giant whirlpools around them was destroyed, even if it's by a coalition of three Great Villages, Kumo, Kiri and Iwa. But due to them, Konoha won the second war, because after the assault on Uzu, the coalition are too weakened to mount a proper counterattack against the vicious attack Konoha did to avenge Uzu. But before he can continue pondering over the history of Uzu, Kurumi said from his back.</P><P>"Well, we're here. So the best way to get into Whirlpool Country is either by air or bypassing the whirlpool. It is going to be pretty hard for you to jump that high from this position, so the best would be to bypass the whirlpool. Luckily for us, Mito once taught me on how to bypass the defences. Just cut your hands and have the blood fall into the whirlpool. The whirlpools are actually a form of seal based defences around Uzu that was created by the Uzumakis. By doing so, the seals, still active after all this time, will turn off, and allow us entrance to Uzushiogakure."</P><P>Naruto, not saying anything, just nodded and cut his hands using wind enhanced kunai (necessary due to the toughness of his skin) and lets the blood drip into the ocean, by the time which his wound have already healed. A couple of seconds later, the whirlpool stopped, the water turning mirror calm, and Naruto walked through, and onto the beach, and further into the land into the Ruins of Uzushiogakure, the land of his ancestors.</P><P>The lands, now scarred with craters from various jutsu, was overrun by the foliage. The ruins of massive structures, with a river in the middle of the village with the supposed Kage tower in the middle was strewn everywhere, but the Kage tower, complete with Uzu's swirl, was still standing, showing its defiance to the enemy, and Mother Nature. The skeletons of many ninjas and civilians, he cannot determine which is which, was everywhere, with their equipments all rusted and their bodies decayed. Some of them are visibly ninjas, their forehead protectors littered around their bones, while some might be civilian, their remains showing no signs of any ninja tools.</P><P>Naruto and Kurumi both stood still watching the sight, and after a while, also giving their prayers to the remains of those who battled here, both Uzu nins and the enemies. Kushina, feeling the sombre mood of her parents, just stayed silent the whole time, not playing around like what she usually did.</P><P>Naruto then created thousands of Shadow Clones, which then, with just a single order from Naruto, dispersed, and started to gather all the remains of the people, both from Uzu and their enemy's. He then gathered all the remains at one spot, and using a Doton jutsu, created a hole for all the bodies to be buried in, making a mass grave. Twice again he used his Doton capabilities, once to cover the hole again, and another to create a tombstone, which he then etched with the wordings:</P><P>Herein lies the People of Uzu, the Ninjas that attacked them, and the civilians caught in the crossfire.</P><P>May by burying the dead together, they found peace with both themselves, and their enemies.</P><P>Kurumi, seeing this, was confused, and decided to ask Naruto, who was praying for the spirits of the deceased. "Naru-koi, what do you mean by 'found peace with both themselves and their enemies'?"</P><P>Naruto, finishing his prayers, unclasped his hands, and said. "As I once said, Kurumi-koi, if I were to create peace within the world, I cannot let myself be consumed with past grudges that wasn't even linked to me, and only related to me by association. By burying them all together in a mass grave, I am hoping that their souls can be together in death, as they are not in life."</P><P>Kurumi, now understanding, just nodded and gave her prayers. Afterwards, they started to explore the ruins of Uzu, looking for either something of value, or just a place to stay. They found out that the Uzukage tower, the only building still left standing, are pretty much the only inhabitable place left. Even the old Uzumaki Compound that they found was wiped out and was mostly rubble. They then started to tidy up the tower, and placed their gear there, preparing themselves for a very long stay there.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Seven months passed since they stepped their foot on the lands of Uzushiogakure. Every day, Naruto didn't just create clones to train, he also created clones to help clear up the rubble surrounding the tower, while also trying to fix up the tower so that it will seem at least mostly habitable. Within these seven months, Naruto and his clones, combined with a multitude of jutsu and their own super strength, has cleared the ruins of Uzu, and also makes the place look much more habitable. During this time, he even managed to train his own strength, being capable of carrying huge pillars of stone without chakra, and destroying them using pure muscular strength. And for certain things that are too large, he just turned into his full demon form and carried them using his tails. A kind of training too, if it may be said as so. Now, the grounds of Uzu has been cleared in its entirety, the rubbles have been cleaned, the holes refilled, and the buildings that are too damaged to do anything about broken down, and turned into rubble. The only thing left remaining was the Uzukage tower, which was reinforced with seals and the pieces of the building around it.</P><P>During these seven months, Kushina, now a year old, 39 kg, 3'4" child, was busy making problems for her mother, because of her playfulness. She kept disappearing, turning into her demon form to hunt for food, which admittedly was helpful since she always brought food back for the whole family. She also plays around within the ruins' area, almost causing her mother to become hysteric at one point when she disappears without a trace, forcing Naruto to use Hiraishin to find her, which causes her to pout cutely when he found her. This then happens again multiple times, so much so that she got scolded by her mother, which doesn't deter her from doing it again, almost frustrating Kurumi to the point where she would've pulled her hair out. She also liked to run around in her hanyou form and chase her tails, causing both Naruto and Kurumi to laugh at her, still having some of her animal instincts within her.</P><P>During these months also, Kurumi now learns how to be a better cook and a better housewife in general. Even for her, the thought of a bijuu hanyou like her becoming a regular housewife was weird in a sense, but that doesn't mean that she didn't do anything. No matter how, she was naruto's first teacher, and she shows it by training with Naruto as well, even if she didn't plan to become a full ninja. From what she knows of both Kushina Sr. and Mito's life, she knows that being a ninja's wife is a hard task. She needs to keep the children together while the husband's not there, worrying whether or not her husband will come back from his mission, or will there just be an ANBU waiting in front of her house's door, saying that her husband has died in the line of duty. But she never let such thought bog her down. She knows that Naruto was strong, and will only grow stronger as time passes. She also trains herself as well so that when the situation requires it, she will be able to take up arms to protect her children and her husband, if need be. Because of this, she trains herself to breaking point as well, though she never let Kushina out of her sight. She can now be considered a low Kage level ninja due to her experience, the jutsu that she can use and her chakra cloak, not including her demon form.</P><P>Today was going to be the most important day for Kushina. Her dad told her that she will start her training in the ninja arts so that she can either become a ninja, or at the very least be able to protect herself in case something happens to her. In her giddiness while standing at the open area around the cleared ruins, she failed to see her dad was already in front of her, though she already sensed him.</P><P>"Alright Kushi-chan. Today we are going to start your training in the ninja arts. Be warned, this training of yours will be extremely tough and hard, but it will pay itself back later. Always remember that this training will be the basis on what you will learn more in the future."</P><P>"Okay dad! So what will I learn first?"</P><P>"So first of all, you will learn a jutsu called Shadow Clones. When you use this jutsu, you will create clones of you."</P><P>"Oh, oh! Like the one you always used every day?"</P><P>"Yes, that one. The clones that you create with this jutsu, when they learn something and they got dispelled for whatever reason, all the knowledge that they learned will be transferred to you, causing you to learn faster. My clones will show your clones on what and how to train, while you yourself will train your physical body. You have already started to train your body since you are small due to the seals that I placed on you, but must train more. Now make the handsign as I will show you, then pump as many chakra as you can into the jutsu and shout the name of the jutsu, Shadow Clone Jutsu."</P><P>"Okay! *makes handsign* Shadow Clone Jutsu!"</P><P>A huge puff of smoke appears around the both of them, and suddenly both of them are surrounded by hundreds upon hundreds of Kushina's Shadow Clones. Naruto then created his own clones with a mere thought, shouts his orders to all of Kushina's clones.</P><P>"Alright! All of you! Listen! A third of you will go with this clone for chakra control training! Another third will go with this clone to learn sealing, and the final third will go to this clone to learn calligraphy! The real one will stay here with me for her physical training."</P><P>In a cacophony of noises, all of the clones all went to their respective tasks, while the sealing clones were being watched by Kurumi. Naruto then turned towards Kushina, who was still extremely eager to start her physical training.</P><P>"Alright Kushi-chan. You must follow my orders to the latter. Follow whatever I told you to, no arguing. Okay?"</P><P>"Okay! So what will we start with?"</P><P>"First, you will do lots of exercises. If your energy is still there after the thousands of exercises that you will be doing, then dispel all of your clones, and create new ones. We will train nonstop until you are tired, if that will ever be possible. Then, after your chakra control exercises are complete, I will teach you elemental chakra, and taijutsu style after you learned sealing and chakra control. We will not start you on jutsus yet. Only once your basics are well, then you will learn jutsus. Also, during your training, you will eat a lot of stuff, most of which tastes weird, but which will help build your muscles and bones so that they are tougher than natural. You will also be trained in tracking and stealth, among others. Understood?"</P><P>"Yes!"</P><P>"So let's start."</P><P>And so begins Kushina's one year of hell, due to her own father. A hell that she was more than ready to accept. And one where her mother was not there to coddle her, saying that she will not have people coddling her all the time, and that she must learn to take some pain for the sake of improving.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>TIMESKIP ONE YEAR LATER...</P><P>One year has passed since Kushina started her training, and she was stronger than ever. Her father didn't hold back during training, causing her, even with her Astartes constitution, to tire out sometimes. She was trained to the ground every day, from sealing training, to chakra control training, to strength training, to spars, and stealth training. Her dad even punched her face with his massive strength, just to show her how tough her Astartes constitution was. A punch that would've turned a regular person's jaw into a bunch of powdered bones and smashed flesh and their skull into deadly shrapnel just felt like a huge punch for her. He even pounded her without mercy, saying that during most times, enemies won't have any mercy for her. He and Kurumi taught her sealing, and with her Uzumaki blood and her eidetic memory due to her bloodline, she absorbed sealing in just 3 months, the remaining time with which she was taught on how to integrate her sealing knowledge with her taijutsu skills. Also, just like how Kurumi taught him, he taught her the Hiraishin, making her capable of using it as well.</P><P>Her chakra control, thanks to her Linker Core, was perfect already, and the only reason why she needs the training is not because of the control, but of the way to use chakra during battles and regular times, like walking on water, tree hopping and others. That she learned quickly. Also, due to the chakra control exercises, not just that she was able to create Shadow Clones without handsigns, she was also capable of enhancing her hits with chakra, causing her hits to become even more powerful. Her father also passed the Chakra Armour and Rasengan technique to her, which she learned quickly, only in about five months. She also learned to use stealth extremely well, and was even capable of hiding her entire blonde fur when she's in her full demon form, and was able to hunt animals without breaking stealth, even during the dead of night.</P><P>Her taijutsu was also nothing to scoff at. Her hits are extremely powerful, and her speed even more so. Combined with her Astartes-empowered reaction time, a fist fight between her and Naruto ends up a blur to any other people, and even for her, her father's skills are extraordinary! She can barely dodge his hits, and when they hit-and they usually do-it felt like a mountain crashed into her! She never thought that her Astartes healing was also being trained at the time, by healing blows that oftentimes left people sprawling on the ground, very much dead.</P><P>Also, another discovery that they did about the purified chakra is that it can be trained, and the next tail means that their power has doubled. So, Naruto, who has ten tails, was two times stronger by sheer power than Kurumi, who has nine tails, and was eight times stronger than Kushina, who has seven. They didn't know how they stand up against another bijuu, though. But the purified chakra was extremely full of life. Not just that it can heal and increase their combat prowess by a huge amount, it can also help give life, like growing a tree out of a seed in seconds, or heal injuries towards others, though it requires good chakra control, since too much purified chakra causes an uncontrollable growth, which thankfully can be controlled easily by just removing their chakra from the item. Using it, Naruto and his family planted new trees on the area around the Uzukage tower, causing the area to turn into a miniature forest. This will have further consequence in the future, but for now, the Uzumaki-Namikazes are ignorant of them.</P><P>Also, the purified chakra causes some of their jutsu to work in different ways. Even just by having them, their Henge turns them into the person or item that they turned into, causing a supposed illusion to become an actual transformation. It shocked the crap out of the family, and that they never thought that it would be possible to do such a thing. In other words, they can henge from anyone to anything, and nobody would be able to tell the difference! Such a prospect was extremely crazy, yet craziness seems aplenty within the Uzumaki-Namikazes.</P><P>As said by her father, other than the basic three, which was the Henge, the Kawarimi, the Bunshin (Kage Bunshin for them), the Rasengan and the Hiraishin, she never learned other jutsus. Instead, she compensates heavily with her speed, capable of entering a melee battle at high speeds, and even break from battle and retreat fast enough. That is not to say that she can't hit hard though. With her own brute strength, combined with the Rasengan and the Hiraishin, she can flash anywhere she wanted, appearing even straight in the enemy's face, or back, before delivering a massive smack down in the form of a Rasengan, or a powerful taijutsu combo, just like her father and her grandfather's tactics.</P><P>They have also discovered something about their full demon forms. In that form, they actually become foxes in every sense of the word, if you didn't count their bloodline as well. They can understand foxes and other canines, their senses became sharper, and most importantly, they went into heat as well, causing them to chase other foxes or just each other. Needless to say, Naruto and Kurumi had so much 'fun' in this form, though they never wanted to know whether or not they can mate at full sizes. Watching two mountain sized demon foxes doing the deed was going to scar minds until the end of time. From what they know of their own hanyou characteristics and their bloodline, they theorised that they can breed with both humans and foxes, though chances are their offspring with regular foxes would end up feral. And a feral hanyou with a huge amount of power is definitely a very bad thing.</P><P>A lot of training was done during the one year period, and Kushina, now a 4' high kid weighing at 68 kg of highly trained muscle and power, was extremely good for her age. Still incapable of matching her father, but she knows that she will be, sooner or later. And with her skills, her father knows full well that she will be an honest threat to anyone, skill level be damned. Also, she had inherited all of Naruto's philosophy, and will do her utmost best to support her father in his quest for peace across the Elemental Nations. As such, Naruto has deemed her ready to go back to Konoha.</P><P>"But dad, what do you mean by 'ready to go back to Konoha'?" She asked. "Am I not ready before?"</P><P>"I told you the story of how your mom was once controlled by someone and how she was forced to attack Konoha right?" she nodded. "People hate me there. They think I am the demon, or rather, I am your mother, the one who attacked Konoha before. I was tortured, broken, damaged, and even so, I kept going. My presence being there again will cause people to aim for us, and you, being my daughter, will be one of their targets. Only after you are capable of carrying the weight of such a burden can we go back to Konoha. You will only retaliate to any of their attacks if they attacked you first. That is the most important thing. That is also the reason why your mom gave this admittedly great bloodline to us. It's so that I will not have to go in hunger and capable of healing any damage they did towards me and will be able to outrun and out power anyone that tries to hurt me."</P><P>Horrified, but understanding, Kushina just nodded. "I believe that I am capable of taking in their hatred, and not attacking them back just because they asked for it."</P><P>"Good. That is also the reason why we decided to have your birth outside the village, and during travels, so that you will be exposed to the hatred and evilness of the outside world, and knows just what you will go through when you took up the same oath as I did. Staying sheltered will not help you when you are to take up that oath."</P><P>Nodding again, Kushina asked. "So, dad, how are we going back to Konoha? Will we just use Hiraishin? You said that you left a kunai at the Hokage. Or will we walk to the front door? What will happen to Uzu then?"</P><P>"Nope. We will use the front door, gave the people some surprise. Also, Uzu will be left, all the trees and the nature here has recovered well, and they will be our tribute to the land of our ancestors. I guess we will be running across the water again."</P><P>Packed and ready, the whole family gets ready to leave the island where Uzu once was, and Naruto cut his hand to stop the whirlpool, and started running back to shore, Kushina following behind, and Kurumi on his back. Once they are back, Konoha will once again be remembered about the pariah that theyhadd forgotten.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Back in Konoha, Sarutobi was fingering the kunai that Naruto gave to him before he left. "It's been 4 years now. I've missed him. Hasn't had any news of him for a while too. Even Jiraiya's spy network didn't pick up any news of him, though he did told me about Arashi the Blood Drinker, an A-rank freelance merc out there, who suddenly aappeared, and as suddenly disappeared. Jiraiya's effort to track him to recruit him also ended up in failure. He must be one hell of a person then."</P><P>He then stood up, placed the kunai back in his sleeve, before turning around and looked at his beloved village, his arms behind his back.</P><P>"Konoha, how you have disgraced one of its greatest heroes." During Naruto's disappearance, the villagers, thinking that the demon child was dead threw a massive festival celebrating his death that lasted for almost a week. Papier Mache figures of Naruto and the Kyuubi was burned and fireworks are launched, yet nobody knows that Naruto isn't dead, and when he's back, he won't take any shit against any attacks towards him or his family, though he will not do anything unless provoked.</P><P>Suddenly, Sarutobi felt a chakra came out from his sleeve, and felt that the kunai was releasing minute waves of chakra, like it was signalling that its master is back, and ready to kick some ass if necessary. Sarutobi just grinned before calling his secretary. "Koyuki, cancel all my appointment after this. I want to be alone, and will not meet anyone unless if it's a matter of grave danger or national security."</P><P>"Okay, Hokage-sama." The secretary, Koyuki, replied. Sarutobi was giddy as ne never was, seeing how his surrogate grandson has grown.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>The grand gates of Konoha has stood for years, weathering three Shinobi World Wars, and created by Senju Hashirama with his Mokuton ability, an ability that still puzzles the researchers and everyone that knew about it. Today, the gate was guarded, once again, by the eternal chunin duo, Kamizuki Izumo and Kotetsu Hagane.</P><P>Kotetsu was about to drop off sleeping when a rock tossed by Izumo hit his head. "Ow! What the hell did you do that for dammit?!"</P><P>"Why the hell are you sleeping?! We are supposed to guard this gate and check everyone that enters! You sleeping on the job will decrease the effectiveness!"</P><P>"But there are no one who passes this gate anyway... Traffic has been slow for days, and somehow not many people are travelling, both in and out. Why can't I sleep?"</P><P>"Because, if someone were to come at you two when you are sleeping and managed to kill you, your other pair would've died, and there would be no one to warn the village that someone came here to attack," a foreign voice answered, and both of them took out their respective weapons and turned towards where the voice came from. The owner of the voice, a giant of a man wearing a cloak and a hood over his head just laughed seeing their shocked expression of when he appeared out of nowhere without they detecting him.</P><P>"Halt! Who are you and what are you doing here!?" Izumo asked/shouted.</P><P>"Whoa, steady there. Here's my travelling permit, and I brought family, though they'll appear on the road in a while."</P><P>As he said, about a minute or so later, the visage of two people appeared on the road, both with hoods on their face and a grey cloak at their backs, by the looks of it. They then reached the hooded man, and stayed at his side. The man then passed his permit to the gate guards, who took it immediately, stamped his papers and allowed him entry to Konoha. Once the family passed, Izumo spoke to Kotetsu. "Do you feel that? They have a massive amount of suppressed chakra that was so well suppressed that they felt like civilians!"</P><P>"Yeah, but who are those? Their papers checks out, but I kept wondering who are those?"</P><P>They both looked at the disappearing back of the three, before praying that nobody does something stupid, both to the three, and the three.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Sarutobi was calmly smoking his pipe, the scent of scented tobacco wafting in the air, before he heard heavy footsteps and the muffled sounds of his secretary arguing with someone. He was about to stand up, when the double doors to his office broke open, and the sight of three figures, one a literal giant, appeared between the doors. He was about to brandish the kunai he was just fingering, when the giant spoke. "It's been a while old man, and your secretary has forgotten about me. Have I changed that much?" the man said, taking his hood down. Out came a mess of spiky blonde hair attached to a handsome face with three whisker marks at his cheeks, and shining sky blue eyes. Looking at this face, Sarutobi just gaped, and has only one thing to say.</P><P>"Naruto?"</P><P>"In the flesh, old man. I'm back, and for good this time."</P><P>-CHAPTER ENDS-</P><P>So ends this chapter, a new chapter of A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel! If anybody is going to argue with me about Kushina's rapid growth, remember that the organs secrete growth hormones, as has been explained multiple times in the chap before you start to flame me. I know about the arguments on Female Space Marines and childborn Astartes, but this is Naruto! If there are bloodlines that can grow bones through the ground like an entire forest and people who can transform themselves into weird looking shit, then a female, childborn Astartes are definitely not out of the picture! Also, sorry about the multitudes of timeskips, but thinking of the various scenes where it's just Kushina playing around and/or she was just training her ass off is pretty hard, and besides, her training went pretty much like Naruto's in the second chapter, so I doubt that repeating it would be fun. So thanks for reading, and don't forget to review!</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>Hello everybody! Here I am, renegadeofficer89 with another chapter of A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel! A bit late for this chapter, but hopefully the 21k+ words would show you why this chapter is a bit slow in coming compared to the ones before. A fair warning, there will be another torture scene and a couple of unmarked limes here, but since you've already read like 9k fics on this site with lemons and shit (and I know my last sucked), so I doubt that you need any more warnings for this. So without further ado, here's the latest chapter of A Loving Heart, A Body of Steel!</P><P>CHAPTER 6: SPAR, HINATA AND ACADEMY</P><P>-CHAPTER START-</P><P>"Naruto! You have grown so much!" said the old man, while trying to hug Naruto, and failing due to his huge size. "And who's this?"</P><P>Both Kurumi and Kushina then opened their hood, which shocked the old Sandaime when he saw Kurumi's face. "Kushina?"</P><P>"No old man, I'm Kurumi. For some reason, my father's soul shard decided to make my face the lookalike of my previous host. I guess he's still laughing up there in heaven."</P><P>"Then this is your human form...?"</P><P>"*sighs* Then would you like to see my demon form?"</P><P>"NO! I mean, ahem, no. So, if you are Kurumi, then who is this?"</P><P>"This is my daughter, Kushina."</P><P>Sarutobi was shocked out of his head, but he cannot deny that she looked just like Kurumi, who has Kushina Sr.'s face, but with neck length blonde hair and three whisker marks on her cheek. And her height was just like an 8 year old kid, but Naruto only journeyed for 4 years! How could he have such a daughter in that time?</P><P>"Naruto, I know that there are a lot of questions that will be asked, but for now, can you tell me how do you have a daughter?"</P><P>"Well, that's an extremely long story jii-san. What about if we sit down here for a while, and I'll tell you what happened during my journeys.</P><P>So all of them started to get comfortable, and Naruto, with inputs from both Kurumi and Kushina, told the story of his four year journey of the Elemental Nations. By night time, finally the story was done.</P><P>"So Kushina Jr. Here is your daughter, and you trained her the same way you are trained when you are still in Konoha, and can now give our jounins a run for their money. Is that right?"</P><P>"Yep. So, to prove this, what about if we have a spar tomorrow? Me and you?"</P><P>"Are you sure? Naruto, I am a Kage for a reason-"</P><P>"And my bloodline allows me to heal myself from almost any injury or damages, and I did not train myself to my breaking point during these 4 years just to watch my skills decay. And besides, your old bones must've been hurting a lot due to them not moving at high performance for a while. So what do you say? It's a good chance for you to see the power of your surrogate grandson anyway."</P><P>Sarutobi was almost convinced. He haven't trained physically for a while now, and his old, war weary bones might still be needed in the future, so a good spar would cause his blood to run, just like it did when he was called 'The God of Shinobi', but he reminds himself of his responsibilities to the village, and reminded Naruto of this fact. "Naruto, I know that you really wanted to spar with me. Believe me, I do as well, but I still have my job as the Hokage. I cannot just leave all this paperwork here without them being complete." He says while spreading his hands, showing Naruto all the incomplete paperwork stacks around the office.</P><P>Hearing that gave Naruto a good idea, one that his Jii-san definitely cannot refuse. "So how about we do it this way? You spar with me tomorrow, for the whole day if necessary, and I'll tell you the secret of defeating paperwork. How's that?"</P><P>A whirl of wind is all that happens before Sarutobi was on Naruto's feet, grovelling. "What!? You know the secret of defeating paperwork?! Tell me!"</P><P>"Only if you spar with me tomorrow. Tell your secretary to place all the paperwork on your desk tomorrow, and use the whole day to spar with me. Is that acceptable?"</P><P>"Yes! Oh yes! I'll tell her that right away!" Sarutobi then immediately ran out of the office, ordering the secretary to do exactly what Naruto suggested, before going back into the office. Then, he suddenly remembered an important information, about Naruto's living space.</P><P>"Naruto, as you are now, you cannot stay within the orphanage, seeing that you already have a family. So then, where will you live?"</P><P>"For that, I need your cooperation. I want to live inside my parents' house, but before you say anything, listen to me first. I will not reveal my parentage as of yet, so, officially, you will give me an apartment somewhere within the village. Then, I will create a Hiraishin seal keyed to our blood on the doorknob which will teleport us into the Uzumaki-Namikaze compound without opening the gates. It will also create a decoy for the villagers if they are to rage again. They can trash the place apart, but they'll never be able to trash the Uzumaki-Namikaze compound. How's that?"</P><P>"But how will you enter the compound in the first place? Won't people see you entering it?"</P><P>"For that, we'll use these cloaks. These cloaks are lined with special anti detection seal that will make my body unrecognizable, and my face covered. Anyone who saw me in the hood will turn away and ignore me, with its effectiveness decreasing the higher the watcher's chakra is. It's the best concealing seal I have ever designed, and it rarely fails me."</P><P>Sarutobi thought that Naruto's idea was ingenious! There was definitely no better idea than this! "But won't the villagers or ninja that might attack you in the future realise that you are not in the house when they came in? Won't that beat the reasoning of such a system in the first place?"</P><P>"For that, there is another seal that I have designed. This seal will create a Kage Bunshin of the one who touches the seal, but using only a small piece of the toucher's chakra while using a special chakra collection seal for the rest. This will create a decoy so that someone will think that I, or anyone that's coming in, stays there, when actually they are over at the Uzumaki-Namikaze compound. That will cover the decoy part. The whole house will also be rigged with stun seals that will disable all intruders within the house, causing them to get caought. That covers the defence of the decoy house."</P><P>Sarutobi was extremely impressed with Naruto's planning capability involving seals. Truly an Uzumaki. But there is another pressing issue for them all. "Naruto, your child was born outside of Konoha. Not just that, you are not officially married as well. I am afraid that someone might try something towards both your daughter and-"</P><P>Sarutobi didn't manage to finish his speech, because all of a sudden, a massive wave of Killing Intent (KI) came rushing out from Naruto, so much so that even him felt afraid towards this boy, no, man in front of him. After Kurumi placates him for a while, and the knocked out ANBU woken up and returned to their respective positions, Naruto then said to the Sandaime.</P><P>"If all that it needs are documents, I'm sure that you can create one can you? It's a simple matter is it not?"</P><P>"Yes it is. Wait here, I'll finish the documents in a bit." Sarutobi was about to went back to his desk to write the document, before Naruto said, "Don't forget to make another document, one for Uzumaki only, and the other for Uzumaki-Namikaze, which will only be released when my heritage be released in public. For now, just reveal the Uzumaki-related document, if need be."</P><P>Sarutobi agreed, and they both used the next couple of minutes to create the documents, with the information for both being supplied by Kurumi and Naruto, while Kushina was already looking bored. After a while, the documents are completed, and Naruto asked the Hokage again. "So, spar tomorrow morning at eight, at the Hokage's Training Grounds. Okay?"</P><P>"I think those terms are fine. I have given the order, and the field is probably ready. Well, I guess I'll meet you tomorrow."</P><P>"Goodbye old man. We're going to set up the necessary seals for us to go to and fro the Uzumaki-Namikaze compound. Wish us luck."</P><P>Sarutobi just nodded, and watched them leave his office, cloaks and hoods up, and seals activated. "They are going to be one hell of a family of ninjas," Sarutobi chuckled.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>The family then split up in two, with Naruto going to the Uzumaki-Namikaze compound while Kurumi and Kushina went to the apartment the Sandaime gave them. Upon reaching the compound's gate undetected, the seals working perfectly as usual, Naruto proceeds to cut his hand and spread his blood over the gate, causing a massive array of seals to glow blue, before the sound of something unlocking could be heard, and the gates opened. He then saw what was supposed to be his, if the village approved and accepted him.</P><P>The compound was not a large one, it was a medium sized compound, maybe enough to fit two or three family of four, with how the side houses looked like. The main house was a two story house with a white coloured brick walls and the symbol of the Uzumaki-Namikaze clan, the Uzumaki swirl with a tri-pronged kunai in the middle on the front. Naruto then created some clones to create the seal at a floor a bit before the front doors and to clear up the place. He then walked towards the mansion, and opened the double doors to the mansion and saw the living room, from which he immediately deduced that his parents are, although rich, did not care too much about riches and appearances and only wanted to live in peace. The living room only has a couple of sofas and a lazy chair close by a fireplace that has no fire in it, being long since died. The sofas surround a coffee table that has a flower pot on it, though it is empty.</P><P>Walking around the house, he saw that the master bedroom was only a bit bigger than a regular room, with a king sized bed and a closet room close by, with the bathroom located within the room. He also saw that there are multiple rooms, probably for the servants or other people who would live within the house as well. Continuing his exploration, he found out that the kitchen was only a bit larger than a regular kitchen, and has drawers mounted on the walls, nothing special. But then, Naruto found a room. A room with his name on it. Feeling curious, he opened it, and the sight that he was greeted with immediately made him fell to his knees and cried. The room has a pastel blue paint covering the walls with wallpapers with the drawings of ramen and Konoha's symbol everywhere on it. There are also multiple drawers around the room, presumably storage for baby clothes. And the most important part was the crib in the middle of the room, probably made by Minato himself, due to the Uzumaki-Namikaze logo on the head part. This room was supposed to be his baby room, the room where he was supposed to grow, watched by his father, and guided by his mother.</P><P>After a while he stops crying, and starts to think of the good things that happened as well with his life. He met Kurumi-koi, his love, gained a powerful bloodline, became a hanyou with massive powers, and had a beautiful, strong daughter. By now, he was feeling a lot better, and closed the door before going to other parts of the house. He also found his father's study, notes on sealing strewn on the floor around the work table, with the rack behind the table containing a massive amount of jutsu and notes, a veritable treasure trove of knowledge.</P><P>Having finished his tour of the house, he created more Shadow Clones to clear up the place since the clones on the front door has finished making the seal for the teleportation. Then Kurumi and Kushina appeared on the seal, signifying the success of the project. They then cleared the place, with Kurumi hugging Naruto while crying tears and continuously saying that she's sorry, and Naruto saying that she has done nothing wrong to him when they saw the baby room, though Naruto's eyes still shone with unshed tears.</P><P>After about half an hour, they have finished their exploration of the house, and were preparing to do their regular activities, with Naruto creating massive number of clones to prepare the training ground behind the house and Kushina to start practicing elemental composition. While the clones are preparing the training grounds, Naruto faced Kushina, and started teaching her of elemental composition theory.</P><P>"...So you will first need to test your chakra element using a chakra paper. Luckily, I always kept some close by, to be used as sealing material, in case it was necessary. So here, have a piece, and channel some chakra to it." Naruto said, while passing the piece of chakra paper to her.</P><P>She then channelled her chakra into the paper, and the results are shocking, even for Naruto. The paper was instantly diced into pieces, before a quarter of them turned to dust until it disappears, another quarter crumpled until it became extremely small, the next quarter burst into huge flames and another quarter turned into water. Watching this, Naruto just facepalmed and muttered something that sounds like "...should've expected this..."</P><P>Going back into professional mode, Naruto said to Kushina. "Alright Kushi-chan, you have an affinity towards all elements, and they're extremely powerful affinities too. So, we are going to train you in the basics of elemental composition for all the elements. While your clones are doing that, you will spar with me to train your body in high speed combat. Now, prepare yourself."</P><P>Thousands of clones are then created by Kushina, and went to practice her elemental composition, while the real her prepares herself for another spar against her dad.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>It's seven thirty in the morning, and the birds are chirping, the flowers are blooming, the people of Konoha have started their business, and Naruto was already standing, arms crossed at the Hokage Training Ground, ready for his spar against Sarutobi. Wearing a t-shirt with the Uzumaki swirl in the middle, a pair of black heavy duty combat pants and covered steel-toed shoes, he was ready for the spar against the Sandaime, who after a couple of minutes, appeared suddenly in a Shunshin in the training ground, already wearing his full combat armour. Seeing that Naruto was already there, he wordlessly started doing warm-ups within the training ground to prepare himself for what he knows was going to be an amazing spar. Exactly at eight o'clock, he was ready to kick ass, and Naruto just grins at this.</P><P>"So, shall we begin? The rules are free for all, as long as no one dies or mutilated or too critically injured, everything else goes. Understood?"</P><P>Naruto just nodded, still crossing his arms with his legs standing shoulder width apart, while Sarutobi immediately went into his Monkey Fist stance, legs low, knees bent, fists high and elbows bent inwards. Without warning, Naruto suddenly sped towards Sarutobi with all the strength his leg muscles allowed, appearing in Sarutobi's range in an instant, fist cocked back to deliver a punishing blow towards Sarutobi. But Sarutobi wasn't called the God of Shinobi for no reason. He immediately deflected the attack using his elbow, noting the sheer strength needed just to push away the fist before coming in closer towards Naruto's body and launching a flurry of punches towards him. Naruto then pulled back his deflected fist and blocked each and every blow from Sarutobi using his palms, before pushing one of Sarutobi's arms away and launching a snap kick towards his head. Knowing that blocking this kick will cause his arm to break, he dodged backwards which was something that Naruto was waiting for. Stopping the snap kick in the middle of its flight, he shot forward using his other leg while the other leg swung downwards and sends another fist towards Sarutobi's direction. Seeing this, Sarutobi dodged his fist to the right, before sending a chakra powered knee strike to his stomach, but the punch was actually a feint. Using the momentum provided by the punch, he twirls his body around to dodge the knee before sending an elbow to his face. Sarutobi then caught the elbow and sends another knee strike to Naruto's face, which hits, but also causes Naruto to be able to grab Sarutobi's body and tries to smash him to the ground in a close range power bomb move, which was successfully executed and tries to stomp the crap out of Sarutobi, who has flipped his body around to dodge the ground smashing stomp, before back flipping a couple of times and stood back in his original stance.</P><P>All this occurred in ten seconds.</P><P>"That's one hit for me Naruto. <I>Damn that hurts my knee! And he didn't even look like he felt it! That throw was very hard, and if not for chakra reinforcements, my bones would've broke into pieces by now! At least I dodged that stomp. That will kill me if it hits. He is an amazing fighter, with his speed, strength and reaction all capable of matching me!"</I></P><P>Naruto, not saying anything, just sped forward, sending a powerful roundhouse kick towards Sarutobi that he ducks under and was about to smash Naruto's unprotected back with his fists when Naruto suddenly cocks his head backwards and smashes his head into Sarutobi's face, who at the last minute, managed to substitute himself with a piece of rock around them. Naruto does not let this distance bother him. Instead, he started doing handsigns before he even touched the ground with his unorthodox maneuver, before sending an overpowered Futon: Great Breakthrough towards Sarutobi's widening due to the sheer power of the jutsu, Sarutobi went into handsigns before releasing his own jutsu, a Katon: Fire Dragon Flame Bomb which met at the middle of the two, before he saw that the flames are strengthened immensely by Naruto's overpowered Great Breakthrough, before turning back towards him. Shocked at this elemental defeat, he creates another jutsu, which was Doton: Mud Wall in the shape of a semicircle to block the roaring flames. The flames hit the wall, but Hiruzen survives the heat, and was preparing to launch another jutsu of his own when his instincts scream at him to duck down, missing a spinning kick from Naruto who appeared behind his back out of nowhere. Turning towards him, he launches his prepared jutsu, a Katon: Fire Dragon Bomb which hits Naruto dead on, and gave him a chance to run away, before a jutsu unlike anything he had ever seen, two huge masses of spinning tornados appeared around Naruto and immediately rushed towards him. He backpedalled immediately and created another Doton: Mud Wall, but this time, overcharged with chakra to take the hit of the powerful tornados. The tornados then crushed the wall like paper, before dissipating.</P><P>Hiruzen, still going strong, decided to launch a Doton: Earth Flow River towards where Naruto would be, before speeding through another series of handsigns and launches a Doton: Earth Dragon Bullet towards Naruto's location. Without handsigns, Naruto spits a ball of lightning which broke through the mud balls and the mud dragon, cancelling the jutsu, before the lightning ball went speeding towards Hiruzen. Hiruzen, shocked but still calm after the boy's display of ninjutsu, tossed a kunai attached with wire towards the lightning ball, which was then grounded once the kunai touched the earth and the wire touched the lightning ball.</P><P>He was about to take a breather when suddenly, three Narutos appeared in front of him with three different handsigns each, sending a huge gust of wind, a roaring flame and a surge of lightning towards him. The attack totally devastates the area where it hits, creating a massive crater where Hiruzen, who has substituted himself with a log within the nearby woods.</P><P>"<I>That was a three element combination jutsu! And he uses them without even saying the names! And the damage was nothing short of terrifying! A regular ninja would've died within that blaze, no doubt!"</I></P><P>Before he can think further, he felt his instincts, trained through years of war, screamed telling him to get away, before a huge blast of white lightning utterly destroyed the place where he was standing. Naruto then appeared in front of him, launching a blitz of lightning fast taijutsu strikes, that he defended against for a while before retreating back.</P><P>"<I>Those hits felt like ninjutsu blows! I almost broke my hand trying to block them! It's like going against a highly trained, straight thinking Tsunade!"</I></P><P>This exchange in taijutsu occurred for another couple of minutes, with Naruto not being able to break through Hiruzen's guard despite his strength, and Hiruzen not being able to attack due to Naruto's sheer power requiring him to defend himself entirely against Naruto's attacks. They then started to break apart, before sending a barrage of jutsus towards each other, with the jutsus either countered or deflected. This continued for almost an hour, before Naruto break apart, and shouted to Sarutobi.</P><P>"Hey jii-san! Want to see a new trick?"</P><P>"<I>A trick? What did he meant by trick? But this might be a proper way to judge him on his full skills, and I'd say that I'll take it.</I> Alright Naruto, what's this... trick of yours?"</P><P>Naruto just smirked, before activating his chakra shroud. The power emitted from Naruto was already very intense before, but now, it went up a hundredfold! Naruto was then coated with a strange golden flame with weird markings all over his body, with tomoe marks around his neck, with slit eyes, blocky whisker marks and a cloak of pure chakra with ten lines at his back. Hiruzen, feeling this power, was utterly shocked!</P><P>"<I>W-what kind of power is this?! It causes him to change his looks, and from what I can feel, it is at least a couple hundred times more powerful than his chakra was!"</I></P><P>"You like it old man? This is the purified chakra cloak, from Kurumi's youki that was purified by my love, and stored within me like a second source of power. In this form, I am even more powerful than I am before, and unlike regular bijuus, this power can be trained and even grew. Now, prepare yourself."</P><P>Hiruzen's instincts are practically shouting in his ears that he should 'GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM THAT MONSTER AND RUN LIKE THE MOTHERFUCKING SHINIGAMI WAS CHASING YOUR OLD, WRINKLED ASS', but before he could react to that, he felt as if a mountain was dropped on his chest, before another mountain fell on his face, and another, and another, and another. The only reason he survives is his instincts was to condense all his chakra within his body and creating chakra armour like the one Naruto uses. But even so, he was hurt badly, and he coughed up blood every hit. Which after a particularly vicious cough, Naruto stopped hitting him, and looked at his condition.</P><P>"Holy shit old man! Damn! I never thought I can hit that hard with that! Wait, let me heal you with this chakra."</P><P>Still activating the shroud, he let his hands touch the Sandaime's body before letting the chakra flow into his body. In an instant, all his cells are rejuvenated, all his injuries are healed, his chakra restored, and even his ageing was reversed! Within moments, Hiruzen sat up on the ground, feeling his body become stronger, his aches disappearing, and so does his liver spots, and his body becoming tougher, almost at his prime! Once again shocked at this display of his otherworldly powers, Hiruzen asked Naruto. "Naruto, what was that? How am I feeling young again? How did you heal me from that?"</P><P>"Oh, yeah. The thing is, the purified youki becomes a sort of contained life force, from which I can let it flow into someone, increasing their life force, causing their injuries to heal, their damages to be repaired, their growth to be faster, and even reverse ageing! I don't know whether or not it can revive the dead, since it is pure life energy contained within someone, but what I know is that by letting some of it flow into someone, it can completely heal them from any injuries and illness. Also, another thing is that not just it can improve my own battle capabilities, it can also be trained, and that any of my children will not only inherit my bloodline, but also the life force. So, not just that we are immortal due to our bloodline, we are also pretty much immortal due to the life force that we contain."</P><P>Hiruzen was never this shocked in his life. He thought that Naruto's combat capabilities are already powerful, but the purified youki further increases his skills, and he was practically immortal by age, the purified youki can also be inherited! A headache that was coming was healed instantly, so he still decided to ask. "Out of curiosity, how much purified youki do you have right now?"</P><P>"Oh. I have about ten tails' worth, Kurumi had about nine tails and Kushina had about seven."</P><P>This almost sent Sarutobi Hiruzen, the Sandaime Hokage, into a state of catatonic shock. His child, just two years old, had purified youki as much as a seven tailed bijuu!? That was insane! But, he guessed that in everything related to Naruto, insanity is an everyday word, so much so that it is better off not being considered as normal, having a normal day.</P><P>"So, Naruto, now that you have reversed my ageing to my prime, would you like to continue the spar?"</P><P>"You bet, old man! Can't wait to fight you at your prime! Don't hold back! I can heal you, and I can also heal myself!"</P><P>"Very well Naruto. You will see why I was called the God of Shinobi during my prime!"</P><P>And so, the spar continued until sundown, with Naruto having to heal the Sandaime multiple times. Even at his prime, a combination of Naruto's bloodline and his chakra cloak was still too much for him.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>At the end of the spar, the Sandaime was sitting down on the ground panting, while Naruto looks fresh, except for the beads of sweat falling off his skin. Watching this, Sarutobi decided to ask Naruto something. "Naruto, how come you are not tired at all? I have been spending massive amounts of chakra as well as you, you have healed and restored my chakra multiple times, went into high speed taijutsu battles and yet you did not seem tired at all. Why is that?"</P><P>"Well, my bloodline, in case you've forgotten, allows me to fight for days upon days without any sleep and rest. My bloodline also gave me near infinite chakra, and combined with my purified youki allows me to fight and fight and continue fighting until either I am dead, or my enemies are dead."</P><P>Hiruzen just nodded, remembering the detail of his bloodline and his amazing purified youki and their uses, and thinks that it was almost sure that all his enemies would die first before they can even harm him. Looking at the time, he was about to end the spar before Naruto stops him.</P><P>"Oh, I forgot to show you some more stuff, jiji. This form is actually my full human form, where my power was minimal and my control was higher. I have two other forms that I would like to show you."</P><P>Hearing this, Sarutobi's eyes almost popped out of their socket. Minimal power?! How much power does he actually have? "How many forms do you have then, Naruto?"</P><P>"Three. This is my main form, the human form. This is my second form." Naruto then transformed into his hanyou form, his ten white tipped golden tails swinging behind him and his fox ears on top of his head. "In this form, I lose some control over my power, but I have an even greater power than my human form. And this is my full demon form. Be warned, you might not like this."</P><P>Before Hiruzen could ask, a massive spike of power appeared from Naruto, before he started to transform into his full demon form, which causes Hiruzen's jaws to fall on the ground. Higher than the Hokage tower with golden fur that shone under the setting sun, Naruto's demon form doesn't felt demonic, unlike the Kyuubi's during her rampage, but the sheer power that it emits was nothing short of insane!</P><P>"<B>During my other forms, a bit of the purified youki flows as well into our system, thus passively increasing our power as well, though in this form, the only thing that could match my power would be another bijuu. Or maybe to wipe out an entire army, or entire village. I never used this form in combat, and it is rarely trained. Urgh, movi ng these huge muscles are much better now. In this form, our size are actually controllable. Let me show you."</B></P><P>With that said, Naruto immediately shrank to the Sandaime's size, and losing only a bit of power from his full size. "See? My daughter even chases her own tails in this form. It's fun, and a good way to exercise too."</P><P>Rubbing his head due to the impending headache while Naruto turned back into his human form, Hiruzen then remembered the deal that they made, before asking Naruto. "So as you said, we have our spar already. So what's the secret of defeating paperwork?!" Hiruzen almost screamed.</P><P>Naruto just chuckles before replying his surrogate grandfather's question. "Oh, it's simple really. Just use Kage Bunshins. You'll learn what they learn, so you won't lose anything by having a couple of them doing your paperwork. While they're doing your paperwork, you can continue training or sparring with me, while you can still learn what they are doing. Right?"</P><P>Hiruzen now felt like slamming his head on a hill, or Naruto's head, or on Naruto's demon form. Such a simple answer! And people call him the Professor? He can't even solve a problem a kid nine years old with unfathomable power did! He didn't deserve the title! He was about to jump straight to his office when Naruto suddenly said something.</P><P>"Oh yeah. Jiji, you better keep yourself in a henge from now on. Everyone might be shocked at how you can become as young and as strong as you are back again, and when they do, things might get real bad for me and my family. So please, just use a henge to hide your looks nowadays."</P><P>Agreeing with Naruto's idea and his reasons, he immediately henges himself to his original looks before the spar starts, while Naruto talks with him. "With this new knowledge, will you be able to spar with me every day? Or maybe with Kushina-chan as well? She'll be happy that her surrogate great grandfather can spend the time to train with her. I'll make sure she won't go into her bijuu form and start spamming bijuudamas towards you if she loses. Can you?"</P><P>The prospect of getting hit with multiple bijuudamas by a seven tailed bijuu hanyou is definitely something that can weaken someone up, but he supposes that there are no better substitute for experience than training, and tanking bijuudamas are not a good idea of training, unless if you're Naruto. Regardless, he accepts the idea, and invites Naruto to bring Kushina any time to train her as well. They then both left the training ground, one to settle all the remaining paperwork in his office, and the other to go back home to train his child. <I>"That reminds me, I must speak with Jiji later about the Academy."</I> Naruto thought.</P><P>-FLASHBACK DURING THE MORNING-</P><P>While Naruto was out to spar with the Sandaime, Kurumi and Kushina were walking around Konoha to buy supplies for their house, like food and other perishables. Kushina was also enjoying the sights around Konoha, and was happily taking in the sights of Konoha during the morning, before she starts her daily training. Then, they saw that the market was open, and they started to buy their stock of foodstuff.</P><P>During their journey there, they managed to shop for a lot of other stuff, and some of the people there even said that Kurumi was beautiful, which earned them a laugh and a small blush. Though some of the people says that Kurumi looks like someone that they once saw, which she denied vehemently. Some even praised that Kushina was a cute girl, and caused her to jump and squeal in happiness.</P><P>Some of the man at the market then tried to flirt with Kurumi, who just laughs, says that she was married and says that Kushina's her daughter, which causes the man to turn back in sadness. Kurumi missed this scene, the people chatting with her, buying everything, living in a home instead of just living on the move without any permanent place to stay. But even then, she knows that they won't be able to have such peace forever, knowing that once Naruto's identity was exposed, they'll be living in a bad situation again. But she also knows that they are able to survive, even with just their own.</P><P>She was awoken from her thoughts by the sounds of the housewives at the market squealing while saying "How cute!" She took a look, and saw that Kushina was being surrounded by a rabble of housewives who was busy playing with her, pinching her cheeks, rubbing her hair, some stroked her whisker marks and gets an extremely cute purring sound in response. The crowd cooed once more, and Kushina, clearly enjoying the attention, was laughing at the people that was hugging her due to her cuteness, though some of the people in the crowd was wondering whether or not they have seen someone like that: a whisker marked blonde boy. Seeing that some of the crowd's members has starting to think about where they have seen such a child, she went in the middle of the crowd, before calling out to Kushina.</P><P>"Kushi-chan! We are going back home! You'll meet these people again later! <I>And hopefully they will forgot the stigma of my attack in this village, though that even sounds unlikely.</I>"</P><P>Feeling a bit sad, Kushina waved to the crowd, saying that she will meet them at a later day, and walked back to her mother, who then took her back home. While walking back, she overheard some of the people's conversation.</P><P>"She's a beauty, that red haired one. The guy who marries her must've been a very lucky guy."</P><P>"The girl was cute! She purrs like a cat when we rubbed her whiskers!"</P><P>"Yea, what's with those whiskers? They felt like ridges, but she really likes it you know!"</P><P>"I think there was once a boy like her you know. Blonde, blue eyes with whisker marks."</P><P>"Really? Never knew that."</P><P>Hearing this makes Kurumi feel a bit better for her child's safety. It seems that they have forgotten about Naruto, and they may not remember him, especially when he's changed so much from how he was before. This made her thankful of the journeys that they went through.</P><P>-END FLASHBACK-</P><P>Naruto was walking back to his house after the spar session. His thoughts are flying over his head when he heard a bunch of people saying something from an alley in front of him together with the sound of someone crying, before he focuses his Lyman's Ears, causing him to hear their conversation as clear as day.</P><P>"You're a disgrace. You shouldn't even be alive, you worthless girl."</P><P>"The Hyuugas are better off without you in their ranks. Having you, trying to change our tradition, was a mistake by the Head, and we are here to finish off what he started. Now die you disgraceful child, and may you not taint the Hyuuga name with your weakness anymore."</P><P>Listening to this, Naruto immediately used his not inconsiderable speed to appear right in the alley, where he saw a bunch of white clothed people surrounding a much smaller figure on the ground. Thinking fast, he immediately shouted to the people in white.</P><P>"Hey you! Who are you and what are you doing to her?!"</P><P>All of them turned towards Naruto, who saw that they are Hyuugas, their white, pupilless eyes a complete giveaway for him. One of them, the supposed spokesperson for the group then speaks to him.</P><P>"This is none of your business, sir. We implore you, please leave."</P><P>"I will not leave until you explain to me what are you doing to that girl."</P><P>"Oh that? We are removing a disgrace to the Hyuuga name. This is a clan matter, and you better leave before we attack."</P><P>Hearing this, Naruto's blood boiled. Being killed just because they are not good enough was a very good way of pissing him off. And suddenly, using his extreme speed, he appeared in the middle of the group of five before seallessly creating Kage Bunshins who grabbed the Hyuugas and teleported into his clan's compound. He himself then lifted the girl up, and looking at her, he realises that this was the heiress of the Hyuuga clan, Hyuuga Hinata. <I>"Why are they attacking Hinata-chan? They're trying to kill their own heiress while calling her pathetic? What happened?"</I></P><P>-FLASHBACK, NARUTO, THREE YEAR OLD-</P><P>A three year old Naruto was walking around the village and was heading towards a nearby playground while chatting with Kurumi within his mind. When he reached the playground, he saw that at the playground, three kids around 9 years old are surrounding a smaller kid who wears a cream coloured coat and white trousers. Immediately feeling suspicious, Naruto immediately questioned Kurumi on what the boys are doing.</P><P>"<I>Kurumi-chan, what are the boys doing to the kid in white over there?"</I></P><P>Kurumi then looked through Nnaruto's eyes before she saw what Naruto saw which causes her to growl angrily. <B>"Naruto-kun, they are bullying the girl, and it is your task to stop them! Do not let them continue!"</B></P><P>Naruto just nodded before rushing towards one of the boys who was currently trying to kick Hinata, who was lying on the ground and was about to take the kick, when a blonde blur appeared in front of her and blocked the kick.</P><P>"What are you doing to this girl?! As future Hokage, I, Uzumaki Naruto, will not let this stand!"</P><P>"Hey, that's the boy my mom said was a demon!"</P><P>"My mom told me to beat him up! She even gave me some candy if I do!"</P><P>Feigning bravery, Naruto then went ahead and started punching them, though due to his height, he was unable to do anything to them, while they pummelled him to the ground. Yet, he never backs down and kept standing back up, even when he was beaten badly. Hinata, watching this, was extremely surprised at this boy's endurance, and promised herself to become someone brave, just like him. After a few moments, the boys are getting tired of beating Naruto up, and left, leaving a bruised, battered and broken Naruto who was already healing. Then, Naruto turned towards the girl he just saved, gave his foxy grin before asking her, "How are you? I'm Naruto! Uzumaki Naruto, and I'm gonna be Hokage someday! Believe it!"</P><P>"*giggles* Y-y-you are a f-f-funny p-p-person, N-n-naruto. My n-n-name is Hyuuga Hinata, and I h-h-hope that we can m-m-meet again someday."</P><P>"Alright! But why are you here alone?"</P><P>"I-i-I don't know. My g-g-guard, Ko, was s-s-up-p-posed to b-b-be here, b-but he's g-g-gone."</P><P>Then, a sound came from the other side of the park, and Hyuuga Ko, Hinata's supposed guard, came and shouted, "Hinata-sama! Hinata-sama, are you alright?"</P><P>"I-I'm alright, Ko, thanks to... Naruto?"</P><P>When she looked again, Naruto has disappeared, leaving a confused Hinata and Ko standing in the park.</P><P>Some distance away, Naruto was seen running away from the park, his injuries have mostly healed. <B>"Naruto, why did you leave her there?"</B></P><P>"<I>Because her guardian's there, and I don't want her to hate me due to someone else saying things that shouldn't be believed."</I></P><P>Kurumi just nodded, and agreed with Naruto's choice, while Hinata was burning the memories of the whisker marked blonde with blue eyes within her head, and promises to be like him, which sadly, will be a promise that remained unfulfilled...</P><P>-END FLASHBACK-</P><P>He then picked Hinata, who fainted by now, bridal style and Hiraishined into his clan compound, where the five Hyuugas from before are crucified on 5 crosses, one each with the clones waiting beside them. Naruto then passes Hinata to one of his clones and told him to place her in an empty room. Nodding, the clone went ahead to proceed with the orders when one of the Hyuugas screamed "You will not escape this! The entire Hyuuga Clan will find you and kill you!"</P><P>"Oh really? Then it is lucky that they will be unable to find me in here eh? And so, your proof will disappear, together with your bodies. I will make sure of that."</P><P>"What do you mean bAAAAAAAAARRRGGGHHHH!" one of the Hyuugas screamed when his eyes was poked by Naruto's fingers until they popped.</P><P>"Since you Hyuugas valued your eyes so much, I figured that popping your eyes would be a good start for your torture before I eat your brains and dispose of your bodies away. So, who should we begin with first? Oh wait, I already started. Well, you're the lucky one. Let's see how much pain the oh-so-esteemed Hyuuga clan Main Family member can withstand."</P><P>Naruto then used his chakra to place a seal on his head that will prevent him from blacking out during his torture. He then starts by breaking his finger, one by one, causing the Hyuuga to just gasp, signalling a very tough composition. "Oh, a tough guy eh? Well, what about this?" Naruto then used his massive strength to rip his fingers off one by one before placing them within his eye sockets, now empty after Naruto popped his eyeballs, causing the Hyuuga to scream, though he cannot black out due to the seal placed on him.</P><P>"Not giving up eh? Then what about this?" Naruto then tore off his trousers and boxers, leaving his genitals exposed. He then stroked them until they are aroused, while the man kept asking "What are you going to do? Please no! Anything but that!"</P><P>"Oh, but you will die anyway later, so better off not having this right?" Naruto then created a very tiny needle using his mastery of Raiton chakra, before closing it towards the engorged dick's head.</P><P>"NO! NO! NO! NOAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRGGHHH!" he screamed when Naruto stabbed the needle on the dick's head, causing blood to spray out of the hole created by the chakra needle while shocking the hard cock, causing him to scream some more. He then proceeds to systematically cut the Hyuuga's penis, causing him to scream until he's hoarse, with the final action being the crushing of his testicals, which causes him to scream even more with his urine spraying out of the penis's now plenty holes, dealing him even more pain. Then, Naruto cuts the penis off before stuffing it in his mouth. The rest of the Hyuugas are already screaming for them to be released, not wanting to go through the pain their partner was submitted to. But unfortunately for them, Naruto was nowhere near finished. He then snapped every bone on the man's legs and arms, causing his mouth to foam up due to the immense pain from the action, before Naruto took out the fingers from his eye sockets, and spat two globules of acidic spit, one for each of his eye socket. This causes him to scream again, even when his throat was already bleeding due to his previous screaming, though this time, his flesh and his face are melting and sizzling due to the potency of the spit's acid. Not long afterwards, he stopped screaming, and slumped, dead.</P><P>"Oh poor me. He's dead. Next will be someone else's turn. But first, I have a brain to eat."</P><P>Naruto then focused wind chakra into his fingers before he starts cutting up the man's skull, exposing his fresh, juicy brain. Licking his lips, he starts to pick up the pieces of brain matter and ate them, licking his fingers while doing so. After he finished eating the man's brain, he turned towards the rest of the Hyuugas, some who have even started pissing and shitting out, losing their bowel controls due to sheer fear. Naruto then started to walk slowly towards one of them, who screamed even louder, before he says "Fuck this. I have Shadow Clones. Boys, show them our hospitality." Before walking back inside the house.</P><P>The entire courtyard was filled with screams for the rest of the day.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Naruto then made his way towards the room where Hinata was cared for, and went in to check. Hinata was being tended by Kurumi and Kushina, and she was in a very bad shape. She has bruises all over her body, some broken bones, mainly on the arms, her chakra network blocked by foreign chakra, but most importantly, the seal on her head, a manji symbol with two hooked lines from the sides of her forehead towards the manji sign, or more commonly known as the Caged Bird Seal, used exclusively by the Hyuuga clan to brand someone as the member of the Branch House. Seeing such a vile usage of a seal like the Caged Bird seal angers a seal master of Naruto's calibre, and he immediately took out his tools to examine and counter the seal placed on her. The seal then expanded, and Naruto felt sicker than he ever was when he found out the seals' functions. It not just seals the Byakugan away on death, it was also capable of dealing a huge stress towards the brain of the one who was branded, causing them to feel immense pain, and was also capable of killing them. It also prevents the women or girl the seal was placed on from giving birth to a Byakugan wielding child, though in Hinata's case, her seal prevented her both from giving birth at all and enjoying any sexual acts. It also cuts out her libido completely. Also, the seal on Hinata prevents her from using the Byakugan at all, and will cause her extreme pain if she activates her Byakugan and will kill her if left activated for long. Naruto was angrier at the Hyuuga clan than he ever was, and if given the chance, he will utterly humiliate and destroy them.</P><P>Somehow, the seals on Hinata are much, much worse than what he knew of the Caged Bird seal, which caused him to wonder what kind of person would place such a seal on a child. After that, with the ease of an elite seal master, Naruto started to create counterseals to disable the combination of seals of the Caged Bird seal, before finishing everything with a flourish, and channelled his chakra into the counterseal. All the seals then glowed, before running away like so much ink. He then, together with Kurumi and Kushina, pushed their purified youki into her body, healing her of all the injury and pains that was plaguing her petite body. After a while, all her injuries are already healed, and her body was now better than ever. Naruto also realised that she has grown some boobs, a sign of either encroaching, or already experiencing puberty.</P><P>A few moments later, Hinata stirred, before her eyes widened in shock and she started to get up and ran away from them screaming "No! No! Please don't hurt me! Please don't hurt me! I did nothing wrong!" while holding her hands above her head, probably bracing for any blows that she might receive.</P><P>Naruto, Kurumi and Kushina, watching this, felt a massive, boiling rage building up within their hearts, and subconsciously sent out a huge wave of KI. Feeling the KI, Hinata flinched hard, before crying even harder. The three then felt bad for making her feel as such, before they hugged her together, huddling together like kittens in a storm.</P><P>HInata, feeling the warmth emitted from the family, slowly stopped crying, finally turning into slow sobs before completely stopping and falling asleep. Naruto, the one hugging her closest, lifted her up, places her on the bed and let her sleep. Kushina, in her rage, asked his dad. "Dad, who? What kind of person would do something like this? Those people in the alley are going to kill her! Who are they, dad?!"</P><P>Naruto gritted his teeth before answering. "Those are the members of the Hyuuga Clan. They are considered as one of the most powerful clans of Konoha, and they are also one who places importance on their power the most. Hinata was the heiress of the clan before, but the seal on her forehead proves me wrong."</P><P>"What? What do you mean by that?"</P><P>"That seal is the mark of a member of the Branch Family, a second family branch within the Hyuugas. They have that mark branded on their head from when they are a child, and acts pretty much like slaves towards the Main Family. With a single handsign, a member of the Main Family can deal a huge pain towards a person marked with the seal, up to their death if continued."</P><P>"And they did such things to their own family? That's horrible!"</P><P>"Horrible as it is, it is within Konoha's clan charter, and it allows clans that settle in Konoha to do whatever they want within their own clan, as long as it didn't harm Konoha or cause problems to those outside their clans. Even we fall under that same jurisdiction, though since we are not officially stated as an actual clan, we are not to invoke any of the clauses within the charter, at least as of yet. Now, we better let her rest, and it's better for us to continue our training, and keeping our vigilance over the compound, in case something went wrong. Come now, Kushi-chan."</P><P>Feeling sombre than how she started the day, Kushina went with Naruto, who left a Shadow Clone to watch over Hinata, though Kurumi was still there as well, placing a wet rag over her forehead to cool her down.</P><P>About an hour later, Hinata groggily woke up, prompting Kurumi to run straight at her, and the clone to dispel himself. Making a groaning voice, Hinata asked, "Where am I? Who are you?" Kurumi just smiled, before answering "You are in the Uzumaki-Namikaze estate, and I am Uzumaki-Namikaze Kurumi, Naruto's wife."</P><P>Hinata was about to say something before Naruto suddenly appeared in front of her and started to check her condition. "Hinata-chan! You're alright! Though we healed you already, but it never hurts to check. How do you feel?"</P><P>"B-b-better than b-b-before, t-t-thanks for h-heal-healing me. And who's that?" she asked, pointing to Kushina behind Naruto.</P><P>Kushina immediately jumped in front of her and said "Hi! I'm Kushina! Dad said that you are his friend, though he has not seen you for a while!"</P><P>Hinata then smiles, a small smile that made Kushina happy, before remembering what happens to her, frowning and started crying. Once again, she was hugged by all three of the Uzumaki-Namikaze family members, before she stopped crying. "T-t-thanks. I needed that."</P><P>Naruto then asked. "Hinata-chan, what happened to you? Why are those Hyuuga clan members chasing you? Don't worry about them. I...' handled' them already."</P><P>Remembering what happened to her, Hinata once again started sobbing, before telling Naruto of what happened a couple of days ago...</P><P>-FLASHBACK A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO-</P><P>Hyuuga Hinata, the current heiress of the Hyuuga clan was walking to her father's office within the Hyuuga clan compounds, her head swirling with thoughts on why he wants to meet her. All the thoughts within her head were never good ones, for it seems like there will never be good news when she was called to her father's office. Reaching his room, the door was opened, and Hinata went inside slowly.</P><P>The room, with three sofas that sat facing a coffee table in the middle of the room with Hyuuga Hiashi, Hinata's father and the head of the Hyuuga clan sitting behind a mahogany table located at the far end of the room that has white walls and ceiling and is busy signing his paperwork for the day. Hinata then walked right in front of her father's table, before speaking timidly "Y-y-you w-want to see me, f-f-father?"</P><P>Hiashi immediately stopped what he was doing, placed his pen on the table and gave a stare that was a borderline glare, so much so that Hinata nervously flinched. "Hinata, tomorrow evening, you will have a spar with your sister, and the winner will be named the heiress of the clan. As the eldest daughter and the current heiress, you will not fail. The one who failed will be branded with the Caged Bird seal and be placed within the Branch family. Do not disappoint me this time, Hinata. You have done enough to shame me within this clan. Now, leave, and go train."</P><P>Not saying anything, Hinata immediately left Hiashi who continued his paperwork afterwards, and ran straight to her room. As she reached her room, she immediately started crying while hugging her pillow, her body shook with every sob she made. <I>"Mother... I missed you... what will you do in this situation?"</I> Hinata was a very gentle and kind person, and will try not to harm anything that she can help not to. This causes her to be the black sheep of the Hyuuga clan, in that all Hyuugas are expected to be tough and deadly. This also makes her father who was brutal towards her in her training and kept demeaning her for her failure and her mistakes without ever supporting her to lose faith in her, especially when her mother gave birth to her little sister, Hanabi. When Hanabi grew, she was peppered with the idea of absolute Hyuuga superiority and was even thought to loathe her sister's weakness, though behind doors, Hanabi was still a kind person as well and loved her sister a lot though she still shows her stuck up attitude most of the time. The teachings of their father are hard to break within her, and will probably still continue. That day, Hinata cried herself to sleep for the umpteenth, and the last, time in the Hyuuga Clan.</P><P>The next day, she, who was still feeling crappy, was awoken by her sister Hanabi, who pulled her pillow from underneath her before she shook her sister's body to wake her up. Hanabi, a 5 year old girl with the Hyuuga's hereditary Byakugan and had her father's looks with a long bang of hair falling from her forehead, was well-trained in the arts of Jyuuken, the Hyuuga's taijutsu style, said to be the deadliest within the Elemental Nations. She was not feeling too anxious as well of the upcoming spar, and it shows in that her effort of waking Hinata up seems more subdued than usual. After a while, Hinata then managed to woke up, before facing Hanabi. "Neechan, how do you feel this morning? Why do I need to fight you?" at this point, Hanabi's eyes almost cried. Hinata then hugged her beloved sister, before saying to her "Hanabi-chan, we are not supposed to fight, but the traditions of our clan forces us to do so."</P><P>"Then we will break the tradition! We must not fight each other!" Hanabi then started to cry for real, prompting Hinata to hug her stronger.</P><P>"Hanabi-chan, you must know, that it is very hard to change the ways of a clan as old as the Hyuugas, and it will be very hard for us to do so. Undoubtedly, one of us will definitely be thrown into the Branch House. If one of us stays, always remember that we might be separated by distance, but not by heart. Also, the ones in the Main Branch must always promise to try to remove all the ancient traditions of our clan, and it must not remain the way it was."</P><P>"Nee-chan, please don't say that like you're the one who was going to leave!"</P><P>"No Hanabi-chan, I know that I'm the one who was going to leave eventually. I can see it in father's eyes that he didn't even expect me to win this spar. Hanabi-chan, please promise on your name and mother's soul, that you will change the Hyuuga clan."</P><P>Hanabi sobbed even more listening to her sister's words, knowing that what she said was true. Hinata then patted her back while saying soothing words to stop her falling tears.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>"<I>Why can't evening came any slower...?"</I> the evening has arrived, and right now Hinata was facing Hanabi, both who are standing in the classic Hyuuga stance with their palms facing towards each other, knees bent, ready to spar while being watched by their father and the elders of the clan. They both then dashed towards each other and started sending palm strikes and gentle chakra powered pokes towards each other at high speeds. But Hinata, ever the gentle and kind person that she was, held back on her attacks, didn't even harm her sister, while Hanabi, fuelled by her frustrations on her sister's early surrender, attacked like no tomorrow, scoring multiple hits towards her sister who, after a short time, can no longer feel her chakra circulating within her body, and fell down, unconscious.</P><P>"It is decided by this spar, that Hyuuga Hanabi will be the new heiress of the Hyuuga Clan, and Hyuuga Hinata will be branded with the Caged Bird seal and be moved to the Branch Family, effective tonight."</P><P>"No. I have a better idea for such a failure. I will deal her own punishment by myself tonight."</P><P>"Then shall it be so. Thus ends this spar. Dismissed."</P><P>The elders of the clan, together with Hiashi was leaving, when Hiashi turned around and called Hanabi. "Hanabi, let's leave. Do not waste your time with this failure, this... disgrace of the Hyuuga clan. Staying with her will taint your skills. Come."</P><P>Hanabi, still wearing her perfect Hyuuga mask, was heartbroken. Not just her father didn't even care about her sister, he doesn't even give a damn towards her feelings and condition, calling her a disgrace! He didn't even bothered to pick her up, just leaving her on the ground! At that time, a fire burned in Hanabi's heart. She made an oath at that time, witnessed only by herself and the gods.</P><P>"<I>I swear that I will change the Hyuuga clan! Even if I were to die, I will change the Hyuuga clan for the better! People like nee-chan will never be abandoned no more! NO MORE! This I swear upon my name, Hyuuga Hanabi and my mother's soul!"</I></P><P>That night, Hinata was knocked unconscious and brought towards a room within the Hyuuga clan, a room made specifically to place the much dreaded Caged Bird seal on someone. She was then laid on the futon in the middle of the room, before Hyuuga seal masters painted her with the seals. Suddenly, Hiashi who sat among the elders of the clan at the side of the room spoke. "Wait. Add some more seals on her. Seals that prevents her from giving birth, seals that prevents her from enjoying the activity, seal that stops her libido, and a seal that prevents her use of the Byakugan. Let her remember of her failures throughout her whole life."</P><P>"Are you going to do something to her?" asked one of the elders.</P><P>"Yes. I plan to banish her from the clan. Such a weakness shall not be tolerated, and she is the epitome of weakness. Having her, or even her descendants within the clan will weaken the clan, not strengthen it. Tomorrow morning, she will be thrown out, and never to set foot within the clan's compound again."</P><P>The rest of the elders nodded agreeing with this, though one of them has plans to deal with her a bit more permanently, being paranoid that someone can break the seal. Oh how right he was. Then, the application of the seals are completed, and they are activated, which causes Hinata to scream loudly in pain until her neck veins appeared and she almost lost her voice before the pain stopped, and she fainted again. She was then taken by a member of the Branch Family, feeling extremely sad of the dismissal of their favourite heiress, the one who never uses the seal on them, and the one who was kindest to them. She will definitely be missed, and he will tell the entire Branch Family member to help her whenever they saw her, except for Neji. Neji's hatred of Hinata was extremely obvious and is known by everybody, but nobody did anything to stop him of it. He will be the only one that will not be told of the news.</P><P>The next warning, she was lifted from her sleep on Hiashi's shoulder and brought to a training ground where Hiashi wordlessly and brutally beat her black and blue, countering any sort of defence that she tried to muster, ignoring her ever increasing crying and the flowing tears from her eyes. After just a moment, Hinata was hit by the Eight Trigrams One Hundred Twenty Eight Palms and was sent flying to a nearby tree, hitting head first and knocking her out. Hiashi then lifted her again, walked to the front gates of the compound, and unceremoniously tossed her to the ground. The rough handling woke her up, and caused her to feel all the pain she was inflicted with and she cries again. Seeing this, Hiashi spoke. "Enough! You are a disgrace to the clan! You are now banished from the clan, and will never bear the name Hyuuga again! May you rot in the streets of Konoha, and don't you ever dare show your face here again! Now get out of my sight!" screamed Hiashi and kicking her for the last time before he went back inside the compound. The Hyuuga Branch guards at the gate sympathised with her and were trying to help, but even they know that helping her will cause them to be punished, thus causing them to just stay put. Without being noticed by anyone, the same paranoid elder starts his plans, smirking in the dark behind the gates.</P><P>Hinata, not being capable of doing too much due to her injuries, then started walking with no destination in mind, aimlessly shuffling her feet away from the Hyuuga grounds. Unknown to her, her five assailants was tracking her movement, waiting for the moment where she went into a shadier part of the village to execute their plan of executing her. About a couple of hours later, their wish was fulfilled. Hinata, feeling the evening cold starting to bite her bones, she went into an alley close by to sleep, with her head still spinning due to her treatment by her father. Suddenly, the five assailants dropped in front of her, surprising her. And before she could mount a defense, a hard kick landed on her stomach, blowing all the air out of her. Before she could recover, another chakra powered kick landed on her, breaking bones. She was crying for mercy when another one of the assailant stepped on her arms and broke them. She was wailing in pain by now. <I>"Why? Why is there no one who would help me? Where is everyone? Naruto-kun, what would you do during this situation..."</I> And then she blacked out.</P><P>-FLASHBACK ENDS-</P><P>"... And that's when you came I think." Hinata finished her story.</P><P>Hearing that, the entire family had the same thought and feeling. Anger unlike anything they ever felt burned within their hearts, even nice, gentle Kushina had her face locked in a mask of absolute calmness, a sign of her own Battle Mode. She was about to go to the Hyuuga clan and show them a taste of her mind when her father grabbed her shoulder and pulled her back.</P><P>"Dad...?"</P><P>"No."</P><P>"But why?! They did that to their own child! How can they even think of doing so!? That, that, that was... just cruel! No, cruel isn't a bad enough of a word for that! They should-"</P><P>"No Kushina. For now, the only thing we can do is to prevent them from doing so again towards Hinata-chan here." Turning towards Kurumi, he asks. "Love, do you have any ideas?"</P><P>"The only way I can think of is to adopt her into our clan. That way, if there are any attacks towards her again, we can counter attack on grounds of protecting our clan member."</P><P>While the two was discussing, Hinata, being already healed by all three of them before, was talking to Kushina. "K-k-kushina-chan, y-you are N-n-naruto-kun's d-d-daughter right?"</P><P>"Yes! And dad's an awesome father! He never did anything that your father did to you. He may train me hard, in fact, harder than what most people would ever go through, but it's because I can take it! Dad may have burned me a couple of times, told me to lift boulders bigger than I am, stopped my heart or two, broke my bones, spat acid at me, even smashing me through an entire forest a couple of times, but that's because I can take it! And now I am stronger than ever! And he really loved me a lot! He hugged me before sleep and always kisses my head! And..."</P><P>Listening to what Kushina went through for her training, Hinata was absolutely horrified! No one did something like that to a child! Not even her father! And she thought her father was evil! But then she heard that she said that she could take it. Feeling curious, she stopped her rambling of her loving father and asked her, "K-k-kushina-c-c-chan, w-w-what do you m-m-mean by 'y-y-you c-can take it'?"</P><P>"Oh, that? It's because of our bloodline! It's a body based bloodline that gave us seventeen extra organs within our bodies! They help us to fight or train non-stop for almost days without sleep, makes us able to eat anything, have bones denser and tougher than steel, muscles that can tear people's head off empty handed, the capability to learn whatever an enemy knows by eating their brain, and perfect chakra control, eidetic memory, the capability to see chakra and in the dark like in daylight, ears that can detect even the smallest sound, poisonous blood and acidic spit, near instant regeneration, can breath in water, poison and disease immunity and the capability to withstood some lesser jutsu! In fact, I may look big, but I'm only two years old, and dad's nine! It's due to our growth hormones from the organs!"</P><P>At this point, Hinata was completely flabbergasted. Such a powerful bloodline! It sounds like they can crush absolutely anything that they fight against, and even then, barely broke a sweat! <I>"So that's why she says that she can take it..."</I> Hinata mused. But before Hinata can talk some more to Kushina, Naruto and Kurumi had finished their discussion and went to speak of it to Hinata.</P><P>"Hinata-chan, it seems that Kushi-chan over there has told you of our bloodline. There is also another bloodline, but that will be a secret. Now first, I will tell you what I and Kurumi have been discussing just now. We have removed the seal on your forehead, but you must still pretend that the seal was there, for obvious reasons." Hinata nodded at this, thankful that the evil seal was removed from her head. "Also, the only way for you to be safe from the attacks of any members of the Hyuuga clan is for you to be adopted into my clan. For now, you will stay here for the night, and I will take us both to meet Hokage-Jiji tomorrow morning to officially adopt you into our clan. It's already night, and as Kushi-chan said, we did not need any sleep, so we'll train ourselves. See you tomorrow."</P><P>Naruto turned and was about to walk out of the room, flanked by her daughter and wife, when Hinata screamed "Wait!" causing them all to turn. "U-u-m, w-will one of you s-s-sleep w-w-with me?"</P><P>All three looked at each other before Kurumi, who was the only one who still slept normally, sighed and went to Hinata's side. "Alright Hinata-chan. I will be with you tonight. These two do not sleep, and will train the entire night. So I guess I will keep you company tonight."</P><P>Giving a grateful nod, Hinata started to cry again, before she was shushed by Kurumi. The father daughter combo then left, with Naruto thinking of what training to give to Kushina when she pulled her pants. "Dad, when we sleep later, can you sleep with me?" She asked, blushing. Naruto just smiled, and answered "of course, my blonde princess. But first, training!" and the two skipped to their training grounds to begin their midnight training session.</P><P>A couple hours later, Kurumi who was sleeping beside Hinata, hugging her while she slept, was suddenly awoken by a struggle from the other occupant of the bed, before she watched her cry, her tears dropping onto the bedsheet. "Why father? Why? I am your daughter am I not? Why did you do this to me?" she said in her nightmares while curling in a foetal position. Kurumi, her motherly instincts crying towards her, hugged her while slowly stroking her dark blue hair. Then, she promised to herself. <I>"In this clan, you will not be treated badly. We will do our utmost best to break you out of your pain, while giving you new, much better memories. You will not be abandoned here until the day we die, we promise you."</I> Hinata's sobbing slowly stopped, while she slowly went back to her sleep, her nightmares not plaguing her that night.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>The next morning, Sarutobi Hiruzen, the Sandaime Hokage, was calmly smoking his pipe while reading his student's newest Icha Icha Paradise book while giggling and a blush formed on his face, with ten of his clones all over the office busy signing and stamping his paperwork, both for the day and yesterday's paperwork, overflowing due to the intense spar that he had with Naruto. <I>"I really need to thank Naruto for teaching me the Shadow Clone paperwork technique. I guess even in my old age, I still had something to learn from young ones. Though thanks to Naruto and his purified youki, I felt much better than ever before, and I actually felt younger! No wait, I actually AM younger! Tsunade is going to shit bricks when she found out."</I></P><P>Suddenly, a yellow flash appeared in front of his table, and with the speed a Kage possesses, he immediately hid his book inside a special drawer that he has and straightened his clothes before readying himself to meet the person that he knew can flash like that, Uzumaki-Namikaze Naruto. But when he watched closely, there are four persons over where Naruto was standing, naruto himself, Kurumi, Kushina and the heiress of the Hyuuga clan, Hyuuga Hinata, who has a piece of cloth tied around her forehead. Before he could say anything, Naruto said "Jiji, we need to talk." Then, without waiting for a response from Sarutobi, he started telling the story of what happened to Hinata, and his ideas. After the story ends, which took a while, Sarutobi was pinching the bridge of his nose. <I>"Why must things like this kept happening around you Naruto...? I bet that even your parents would be beating their head on a wall due to your actions..."</I></P><P>"Naruto, it is a good idea to adopt her into your clan. However, this will force me to expose your real identity to the council, since clan adoption is under council matters. And exposing your true identity is going to cause uproar within the village, not to mention that it will probably be rejected by the council as well."</P><P>"Then what else can be done? I will not just stand on my foot and do nothing because of some bunch of idiots not wanting to accept an adoption into a clan."</P><P>"The only way for you to adopt her into your clan without any problems that I can see without any interference from the council is by marrying her. Since marriages are handled by the Hokage and the Hokage alone, they cannot do anything once the marriage has been finalised."</P><P>Listening to this, Hinata gained a major blush on her face before she fainted suddenly, thoughts of being married to someone at nine years old passing through her head. Naruto, who heard this was having a small blush as well, before he notices Hinata swaying in her seat before falling down, fainted. He immediately caught her and fanned her face, shouting "Hina-chan! Hina –chan! You still there? Talk to me!" while everybody else had a massive sweatdrop behind their heads at this weird scene of a giant tending to a petite child.</P><P>A couple of minutes later, Hinata woke up, the Sandaime's words still swirling in her head. In her disbelieve of the idea, she almost missed Naruto saying "So is it okay for you of this arrangement Hinata?"</P><P>Hinata just blurted without thinking "But Naruto-kun is already married! They even had a child together! So how can we marry each other?!" nobody notices that her stutter seems to disappear all of a sudden. Hearing her reasoning, the Sandaime just chuckled, before saying. "It's true that he is married. However, we in Konoha does not oppose polygamy, though most does not practice it because of certain limitations, limitations which Naruto can overcome," the Sandaime said, giggling perversely. "I trust that Naruto, or one of his family members must've told you of their bloodline, yes? That will be very helpful later. So how will it be?"</P><P>Hinata ponders upon this fact for a while. On one side, she will not be bothered again by the Hyuugas, and if they do, they are to fall into Konoha's law concerning attacks towards another citizen. And since she will be married to someone else, she will be considered part of that person's family or clan, and will be protected under Konoha's clan laws. Considering all the benefits when compared to the loss, she decided that it is better for her to be married to Naruto. Besides, she had a crush on him since she first met him, and this is like a dream come true for her!</P><P>"S-s-sandaime –sama, I h-h-have decided to ac-c-cept the o-o-offer to m-m-marry Naruto-k-k-kun here."</P><P>"Good. But before the paperwork can be finalized, Naruto, you need to find a ring for both of them. I just realised that you did not gave Kurumi any marriage ring, and it might be a problem later on."</P><P>"Oh crap! How can I forget about the ring! Wait here you guys, I'll try to find one. Jiji, I suggest not letting anyone into the office for now. Trouble might be brewing, but not in here." Naruto said before hiraishining away, leaving Hiruzen to complete the paperwork related to them both.</P><P>About an hour later, Naruto came back carrying two ring cases, with himself wearing a ring as well. The rings are simple gold bands, no diamonds, and no additional blings. Just 3 gold bands with the Uzumaki swirl etched within them.</P><P>"I guess the people really didn't recognize me now. That guy at the counter even offered me a discount! They definitely had a party when I'm gone didn't they, Jiji?" Hiruzen was about to answer when Naruto then said "Naah, no problem old man. But with me looking so different, they won't consider me as me, just some giant of a guy. Anyway, here's your ring, Kurumi-koi." Naruto said before lifting Kurumi's hands up gently, placed the ring on her finger, before giving the ring a gentle kiss, which Kurumi replied by jumping towards Naruto and gave him a very deep kiss, which causes Sarutobi to snicker, Kushina to gape and Hinata to blush heavily while controlling her fainting reflex.</P><P>When the kiss starts to become a full blown make out session, Sarutobi cleared his throat to stop the husband and wife pair, who separates with a blush. He then hands Naruto the papers for the marriage, with two copies of them, one as Uzumaki only, and one for Uzumaki-Namikaze. He then passes the papers to Hinata, who signed them, signifying their union. Sarutobi then stood up, before starting to give Naruto the wedding vows.</P><P>"Uzumaki or Uzumaki-Namikaze Naruto, will you take Hinata as your lawfully wedded, to be with her together, in sickness and in health, in sadness and in happiness, in highs and in lows?"</P><P>"I do."</P><P>"And do you, Hinata, will you take Uzumaki or Uzumaki-Namikaze Naruto as your lawfully wedded husband, to be with him together, in sickness (<I>Not that he can get sick</I>, Sarutobi thought) and health, in sadness and happiness, in highs and in lows?"</P><P>"I-i-i-"</P><P>And she faints. A laugh came out of Sarutobi's mouth, while both Kurumi and Kushina are trying to wake her up. When she wakes up, the vows are continued, but this time, Sarutobi just asks whether or not she wants to be with Naruto, which she stutters out, "I-i-i-I d-d-do."</P><P>"Then, by the power vested to me by the Daimyo of Fire Country, I pronounce both of you husband, and wife(s). You may kiss the bride."</P><P>It is a very comical scene, watching the 6'7" Naruto kneeling down to kiss the relatively tiny 4'2" Hinata, but for Kurumi, the scene screams "ROMANTIC!" at the top of her lungs. Hinata was trying, and failing miserably at controlling his nervousness seeing Naruto's handsome face getting closer and closer to her, and once she felt Naruto's lips on hers, her head poofed, a puff of smoke came from her ears, and she fainted, out like a light, causing Naruto to sigh. Letting Kurumi and Kushina try to wake Hinata up, he spoke to the Sandaime.</P><P>"Hey, jiji. The academy starts in two months right?"</P><P>"Yes, it's currently the holidays. Are you planning to enter the Academy?"</P><P>"Yes. I don't want myself to be advanced in ranks just because I sparred with you every day, though that would be a good reason to do so. No, I want to advance normally, well, as normally as I can. Also, I am planning to change Hinata in this two months, from someone like that, " he said, pointing to the still blacked out Hinata "To someone worthy to stand at my side, both in battle and out of it."</P><P>"Are you sure of that? Think you can change her? Hiashi has done a great job at destroying the child, and reversing that will be extremely hard."</P><P>"Extremely hard, but not impossible. I will show you that an Uzumaki will not go back on his or her word! Believe it!"</P><P>"*chuckles* Then, you better go back, take those papers, and bring the new Ms. Uzumaki-Namikaze to her new house." Taking the dismissal, Naruto, carrying Hinata bridal style with Kurumi and Kushina hiraishined back to the house, while Sarutobi and his clones continued their respective tasks, one to read Icha Icha, and one to continue finishing up the paperwork.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Naruto then reached the house, and went immediately to the master bedroom, before placing Hinata, still out of it, on the bed. Now, Naruto had a thought in his mind. The King-sized bed his dad left him will definitely not fit his augmented body, and even more so with three people. <I>"I need a new, tougher bed."</I> Then suddenly and unbidden, thoughts of a threesome with him, Hinata and Kurumi flew through Naruto's mind, causing him to blush deeply. <I>"No! Not yet! Hinata's still too young for that! We may be married, but she is still too young for that! Maybe in a couple of years..."</I> and Naruto's nose starts to bleed, as a very perverse grin appeared on his face.</P><P>Hinata then decided to wake up at that time, and seeing the perverse grin on his face, combined with the blood flowing from his nose, caused her to scoot to the back of the bed, which caught Naruto's ears, who immediately wiped the blood and went to Hinata, asking "Hinata-chan, are you alright?"</P><P>"W-w-we a-a-re r-r-really m-m-married, aren't we?"</P><P>"Yes we are, though we haven't done anything as a married couple." On saying this, another perverse grin appeared on Naruto's face, which causes Hinata to scoot even further. Naruto then snapped out of his daydream, before saying. "Hinata-chan, I will say this first. We may be married, but I won't do anything that you didn't want me to. If the thoughts of having sex so early repulsed you, then I will not. That is my oath, the same oath that I did with Kurumi-chan. Now that you are my wife, I will tell you something. I will not have a weak wife." At this, Hinata's face drooped considerably. "But don't get me wrong. By saying that, I meant that I will train you to be as strong as you possibly can. The training will be extremely tough, though I won't try to kill you like when I trained Kushina-chan. No, I will train you with a different method, but rest assured, that you WILL grow strong, strong enough to defend yourself and our family in case something bad happens. Remember that, Mrs. Uzumaki-Namikaze Hinata."</P><P>Listening to that name made Hinata blush madly, but something tickled her mind. Then she remembered. <I>"Namikaze was the Yondaime's family name!"</I> "Ano, N-naruto-kun, w-w-why is y-y-your family n-name Uzumaki-Namikaze?"</P><P>This made Naruto sigh. The explanation for this is definitely needed, especially considering that they held a lot of the village's secret among them. Naruto then stood up, before going outside the room to call Kurumi and Kushina into the room. Once they are inside the room, Naruto asks Hinata. "Hinata-chan, what do you know of the Kyuubi attack?"</P><P>"A-a-ano, the Kyuubi at-t-tacked Konoha f-f-for no reason, a-a-appearing suddenly a-a-and started killing and d-d-destroying everything in sight, b-b-before the Yondaime killed the Kyuubi."</P><P>"He did not kill me! And I didn't attack for no reason! I was controlled!" Kurumi pouted.</P><P>Hinata, feeling confused at this, just tilted her head cutely, which made Naruto sigh before he starts explaining everything. Kurumi's attack on Konoha, his parentage, the deal, his ancestors, Kurumi's father, the Juubi, the chakra, his bloodline, everything. By the end of it, Hinata's head was spinning with newfound information.</P><P>"N-n-naruto-kun, you s-said that y-y-you have a h-h-hanyou f-form. C-can you s-s-show me?"</P><P>Naruto just nodded, before all three of them turned into their hanyou forms, their majestic golden tails flowing at their backs. Hinata froze at seeing this, before she, with a speed she never had, jumped on the tails, and rubbing them on her face, crying "Sooooo cuuuuuteeee!" this action of rubbing his sensitive tails causes Naruto to become EXTREMELY aroused, while a blush appeared at his face, which becomes redder when Hinata starts to stroke his tail and wrapped it around her face while sniffing and kissing it, inhaling its masculine scent. Kurumi, knowing of the sensitivity of their tails, just snickers and enjoys the sight of Naruto being toyed like so much a kid just because his tails got played. Preventing things from going further, Naruto immediately turned back into his human form, causing a pout to appear on Hinata's face. Clearing his throat, Naruto then continued to talk again.</P><P>"So that is my life's history. As I promised, I will not let any child to be harmed in front of me, and you are one of them. Any questions?" Hinata shook her head, prompting Naruto to continue. "Now, we need a bit of your blood so that I can place it inside the security seals so that they recognize you."</P><P>Hinata then pricked her finger on a needle that Naruto passed to her, which then used to identify Hinata within the house's defensive matrix. Once that was done, Naruto, with a blush on his face then said this to Hinata. "Alright hina-chan. Now, I would need you to strip."</P><P>Hinata immediately fainted with a blush hearing this, causing Kurumi to go on a tirade while pulling Naruto's ears about tact and sensibility, before Hinata woke up. "Hina-chan! I'm sorry! Before you start to hyperventilate and faint again, please hear my explanations first. The reason why I want you to strip is that so I can tattoo you with a variety of seals, like chakra storage seals, Hiraishin seals, storage seals, resistance seals, gravity seals and many more. All the seals are not just to help you train yourself, they are also to ensure your continuous survival in all conditions, since you have all your supplies close to you. Please do not take any dirty thoughts from this action. I do not meant for it to be so. And besides, we ARE husband and wife now, and you should not be ashamed of your body, nor I am of you. I have two beautiful wives, and I will do anything to protect them both from harm. If it makes you more comfortable, I can have me and Kurumi strip with you as well. Will that be okay?"</P><P>Hinata just nodded before watching Naruto and Kurumi to both strip in front of her, causing her to blush madly while doing her best not to faint. She then takes a peek, and saw Naruto's hardened chest muscles almost bursting out of his skin, while his penis, surrounded by blonde pubic hair, still semi hard from what Hinata did to her before, suddenly became Hinata's main focus. <I>"That... will go into me...? Will that fit? Kurumi feels fine, she didn't even blush!"</I> she then took a look at Kurumi, and what her saw can almost make her become a lesbian. Her breasts, shapely and firm C-cups are bouncing as she was removing the shirt she was wearing, with a hourglass body, though not extremely small and a toned, tough stomach, the result of sparring with Naruto. Then, Hinata's eyes moved to her hips, which although are wide, child bearing hips, still was muscular and tough, a result of all the training and journey that she did with Naruto. Her thighs, tough and strong, but somehow still retains their whiteness and their softness, though even she knew that the softness hides the power that they can dish out to an enemy. And finally, Hinata's eyes trailed upwards and saw her pubic area, which was previously hidden by the panties that she wore, tough they are now removed. Covered with red pubic hair the colour of her hair, she saw that even her pussy lips are delicious, almost causing her to drool.</P><P>Kurumi, seeing this, decided to tease Hinata, and placed one hand at her back before she posed for Hinata. "Enjoying the sight?" Hinata immediately fainted with blood pouring out of her nose, while Naruto just nodded mutely, enjoying the sight of his first wife standing stark naked in front of him, who was also naked. Naruto felt like jumping her, but remembering Hinata, he held back his raging sex drive, and does his best to shrink his boner. They then woke Hinata up, and she was greeted with the sight of Kurumi's majestic boobs and Naruto's tough and perfectly sculpted body, and she immediately screamed at both of them "WHY ARE YOU BOTH NAKED?! HAVE YOU NO SHAME?!"</P><P>Kurumi just shrugged her shoulders before answering "We are husband and wife. Besides, he knew every. Inch. Of. Me. Right?" with every word, she kisses Naruto, while her hand goes lower and lower rubbing and gently touching Naruto's torso while Naruto's raging boner just got harder at her actions. But before anything happens, Naruto cuts off Kurumi, before whispering "Tonight, my crimson princess, not now", which causes her to giggle while Naruto turned to look at Hinata.</P><P>"Hina-chan, she is my wife, and my mate. This is what we do. We have sex, tease each other, and generally try to make each other horny. This will also be the first step for you to gain confidence. Don't worry, I will not do anything to you unless if you let me. These seals are important, and you must learn that feeling ashamed are not a good thing, especially when in front of your husband. Forget your past, this is your life now, with me, with us. Just strip and I'll place those seals on you. The reason why we're doing this is because we hoped that you'd get more comfortable with us being naked as well."</P><P>Nodding, Hinata then gathered all her courage and started to strip while Naruto watches every inch of his new wife's body and burns it into his mind with his eidetic memory. Her dark blue, hime cut hair and fair skin, which causes her blush to be noticeable, her Byakugan eyes, her smooth lips, her budding A-cup breasts, her tiny torso, initially covered with scars due to abuse which disappears due to their healing, her nether lips, still smooth , though small hairs have already started growing, her slender legs and her dainty fingers, he drank them all, and realises that she will be one hell of a beauty in the future. He suddenly rushed forward, grabbling both of his wives and places them in a tight hug, while still being naked together with both of them. "I thank any and all deities who decided that having two beautiful wives are good for me, and for that I thank all of you, and will cherish them both until the end of time."</P><P>Hearing this, tears of happiness came out of both his wives' eyes, and they hugged him as well, not caring that they are naked, while Kurumi said "We will not leave you Naruto. Don't forget that as well." Hinata, not trusting her crying eyes, just nodded.</P><P>After the heartfelt crying session, Naruto then asked Hinata to lie down on the floor, where he unsealed his sealing kit and started to paint the seals on her body. While doing that, watching the blush on Hinata's face and her confidence training, he decided to tease Hinata a bit. He purposefully passed the brush over Hinata's nipples, causing Hinata to gasp lightly and her nipples to perk up. He further teases Hinata, passing the brush over her nipples, over her stomach and over her bellybutton. These acts cause Hinata to shiver, either in pleasure or due to coldness, no one knows. Watching her reaction from the corner of his eye, Naruto smirked, before continuing to paint the seals on her body, causing her to gasp and moan lightly at one point. By this moment, Naruto's boner was raging horribly, though Hinata, due to her lying position and Naruto sitting legs crossed beside her, she missed the sight. But being the professional that he is, he immediately cleared his mind of dirty thoughts, promising himself to get a 'therapy session' from Kurumi tonight.</P><P>After a while, the seals are complete, and Naruto flows chakra through them while saying "Seal!" all the seals then converged to a point centered at Hinata's bellybutton, except for the weapons supply seals that are located at her wrists for easy access.</P><P>"Okay, Hina-chan. The seals that I have placed on you are as I said before, the Hiraishin seal, the chakra absorption seal, supplies storage seal, the resistance and gravity seal. All this will help you both in training and out of it. The Hiraishin seal will allow me to come to your help no matter how far or how bad, just channel chakra into the seal and I will come. The chakra absorption seal is a bit weird. It is to train your chakra reserves by sucking all your chakra until you have civilian levels of chakra, and also absorbs the chakra that your chakra core produces to maintain that chakra level all the time and once a day, all the day's absorbed chakra will be entered back into your chakra coils, forcing them to expand. This is the fastest way for you to grow your chakra, and since these processes are automated, your chakra will keep growing, and growing and growing, causing you to have a huge chakra reserve in a short while. Though this will hurt during the expanding process, it can also help train pain resistance, and we will help you as well if it gets too bad. The supplies storage seals are self explanatory, though you will still need to be trained on how to take out only the item that you want. The resistance and gravity seals will increase the resistance and gravity around you, causing you to feel like you're wading through mud every day at every moment and stresses your body so that it builds more muscles and harder bones, good for physical training. Combine this seal with the chakra absorption seal, this will cause you to feel extremely tired every day, especially when I force you to use chakra. This will force your core to work harder, producing more chakra, though at first it will seem like you are going to die. If it gets too bad, we will help heal you, but you will still have the seals activated on you. Got that?"</P><P>Hinata, already feeling the weakening effects of the seals, only nodded, which she found out that even simple movement, would become a chore. Naruto then lifted her up to her bed, before leaving, and bringing out three futon for her. He then spread the futon on the floor, and places Hinata, still naked, on the futon, before lying down on the futon as well, and using one of it as a blanket. Hinata was blushing madly at this point, and only managed to stutter out "W-w-why?"</P><P>"Why? Why am I placing this futons? It's for you to sleep. Why are you and me naked? It's so that you can get used to it. We ARE husband and wife now Hinata, and if we are not used to seeing each other naked, how will we have children? You must get used to it fast, and I figured out that this would be the easiest way to increase your confidence fast."</P><P>Hinata just blushed even redder by this point, feeling too burdened by the seals to speak. The real Naruto, peeking out of her room, watched his clone sleeping while hugging Hinata while naked in an effort to increase her confidence. Naruto just snickered before going back to the master bedroom, where he was met with the scene of a very horny, very much naked and was quickly fingering her pussy on top of their bed, causing Naruto's dick to immediately harden to its maximum, and he immediately jumped on the bed, ready to make love to his first wife. And thanks to the seals they placed around the room, Hinata, who slept on the futon on the floor in the room next to them, does not have any problems sleeping due to the loud noises from the next room.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>Hinata was unable to sleep! Even just the prospect of sleeping naked with someone caused her to blush massively and faint, and now, she had Naruto, her new husband, sleeping beside her naked, while she was also naked! To top it off, he's a clingy sleeper, and is hugging her right now! His hands was around her neck with his head in the crook of her neck, causing his every breath to blow on her neckline, sending massive shivers into her body. Not just that, she can feel that his leg was close enough to hers, so close that she felt his member on her leg! Fainting does not help, that occurred a couple of times, and she can't move her body, they are still getting used to the seals, and her body felt more like molasses than human. This forces her to stay put, and watch the face of her new husband while they are sleeping together. His spiky blonde hair and whisker marked cheeks, combined with his calm, sleeping face, made Hinata felt glad that he was her husband. She then smiled, before seeing him wake up, the sky blue eyes that she loved staring back at her own Byakugan white eyes.</P><P>"So, Hina-chan, had a good night sleep?"</P><P>At this point, Hinata was only able to mumble incoherently, and suddenly Naruto said. "As long as you are still ashamed of both your body and yourself, we will be doing this every day, until you no longer felt ashamed of your body. I can see that you will grow up to be a beautiful person in the future, and the Hyuugas' loss, are our gain. Not just that, I can feel your spirit, and know that you can be a strong woman in the future, that can stand toe to toe with us, no matter how. Now, you best get up, we will begin your training. And remember that the training will be hard, but we will never cause you to be too critically injured. Now wake up you." And before Naruto walked out of the room he asked, "Did you feel that pain last night? That was your chakra coils being expanded. That will happen again and again every day, and you will get used to it over time."</P><P>Hinata then remembered that a searing pain that spread through her whole body from the inside last night, but due to the seals and Naruto clinging to her, she cannot even wriggle to reduce the pain that the forceful expansion of her chakra coils caused. And now, she felt that her chakra is back to a civilian's level, and she forced herself up. The resistance and gravity seals really made life difficult for her, and that really was problematic. She finally managed to reach the training ground behind the mansion, wearing a black shirt with black pants that she found laying beside the futon in her size. Naruto was already there, and she saw that a clone of Naruto's was already going into katas for some taijutsu style with Kushina following beside him, and Kurumi watching them all from the inside of the house.</P><P>Seeing that Hinata's attention was elsewhere, Naruto called her on it. "Hinata, focus on me, please." Hearing this, Hinata quickly turned towards Naruto's location, with a blush quickly forming on her face. Looking at this, Naruto sighed, before he begins to speak. "We really need to stop you from blushing too fast. Your face is whitish in colour, and even a little blush will be easy to spot. Anyway! First, I will need you to train your physical strength, while at the same time you will train your chakra. Now first, take a leaf from anywhere that you can see, and place it on your forehead, holding it only with chakra while jogging around the clan's compound. I will follow beside you at your pace, and will help you if you felt too tired or whatever. Until you can get used to the chakra, resistance and gravity seals, I will not start training you in anything else, except maybe on sealing. Now, start jogging."</P><P>Hinata nodded before grabbing a leaf from the ground, an action made harder due to the seals placed on her. Then, using her chakra, she stuck the leaf onto her forehead, and started jogging around the compound. Even during her first few steps, she can feel that her speed was extremely slow, and she looked as Naruto kept pace with her with just his walking speed, his huge strides easily coping with Hinata's slow speed. But just as Hinata was about to falter and give up during the first half an hour, Naruto, once again, appeared beside her, before holding her shoulders. "Good job, Hina-chan. I never expected you to be able to jog this long. The seals I placed on you are also self adjusting, and that means any adaptation you did will increase the seals levels, so that you will feel the same resistance. And you will feel more tired than ever, with your chakra being drained by the seal, and the chakra control training that I put you through. The weakness to this training is that your chakra control will be shot to hell, but that's nothing new. Anyway, once we entered the academy, I will use that 5 year time to train you in the Gentle Fist."</P><P>"B-b-but Nar-r-ruto-kun, h-h-how did you k-k-know the G-g-gentle f-fist s-stances?"</P><P>Naruto just chuckled. "Remember the Hyuugas chasing you before? I used my clones to capture them, and now, their traces have been wiped off the map completely. And I also ate their brains, giving me the complete knowledge of the Gentle Fist style, including the forbidden techniques like the Rotation, Eight Trigrams Sixty Four Palms, and the Air Palm. It may sound creepy at first, but I ate strong enemies' brains after I killed them because their knowledge would be invaluable. Also, what better way to show the wrongs of the Hyuuga's ways then to use the skill that they prided upon themselves to defeat them? Now, you need to train your physical body to endure the difficulties of training it and to improve yourself."</P><P>Hinata just nodded, and continued to jog while holding the leaf to her head with chakra, and in just ten minutes, she immediately collapsed to the ground from exhaustion. Watching this scene, Naruto just smiles, before using his purified youki to heal her back to full strength. Feeling the life energy coursing through her body, she was immediately revitalized, and she can even feel the pain that she felt due to her tearing muscles heal. This is a family she never stops being amazed at. She then continued the training course, doing the same thing over and over again until the evening. She cannot feel any improvements, but Naruto assures her that it's because the seals can auto adjust to any improvements that she made. He also says that once a week, they will turn off the seals and they will get herself used to her current speed without the seals.</P><P>That night, Hinata asked Naruto about why are they still going to get naked and sleep together. "N-n-naruto-kun, n-n-ot that I am ungrateful of w-w-what are y-you doing f-for me, b-b-ut can I a-ask you w-w-why are you s-s-sleeping w-w-ith me again?"</P><P>Chuckling again, Naruto answered "As I said last night Hina-chan, I want you to gain confidence due to your body and yourself fast. And from what I know, this will be the fastest way to do so. Besides, it will get you used to a man's body, and will not get you blushing madly in case a man shows his body to you, not that they can compare to me. You are naked as well, because I happen to like your budding body, and I know that you are going to be a beautiful wife later. The next stage is then for you to sleep together with both me and Kurumi, and most probably will be watching us having sex as well, so as to get you used to the idea of having sex and to prevent you from blowing your head up during the act. Also, it will be useful later when we start having threesomes." At this, Naruto starts to giggle perversely, with a blush on his face and a trickle of blood from his nose. By that time, Hinata has already fainted due to sheer shame from thinking of the act.</P><P>Then suddenly, she woke up again from the feeling of pain that came with the forceful expansion of her chakra coils, causing her to grit her teeth in pain, trying to bear then pain, if not for her own sake, then for the entire Uzumaki-Namikaze family that she was now a part of. But Naruto still woke up, and places his hands on her head and chest, trying to dim the pain for her. Feeling grateful to that, she just nodded, mouthed a 'thanks' to him before falling asleep again.</P><P>The next morning, Naruto created clones to oversee both Kushina and Hinata's training, saying that he wanted to go to town to buy a new mattress and bed, since "The old one won't fit us." The insinuation of his words did not go unnoticed by Kurumi and Hinata, with the former blushing with a smile and the latter immediately fainted on the ground. Chuckling, Naruto left them and his clones to their own devices, while he himself went into town to buy a much needed mattress and a new bed, since the old one broke apart last night due to his 'activities'. By the evening, he came back with a new bed and a new mattress, both within a sealing scroll that he had. Unsealing the bed within the large master bedroom, the new bed was custom made by Naruto himself as training in his seals and chakra nature abilities. Made using trees in the Forest of Death, the wood used are lumber from trees that was made by the Shodaime himself, causing them to be extremely tough and resilient, but to be sure, Naruto still placed toughness seals on the bed so that they will not break it during the awesome threesome that Naruto was sure to come. The mattress is as large as the bed, being six inches thick, nine foot long and twelve foot wide, causing it to have a rectangular shape. Naruto said that "A bit of bonus payment to the guy who makes the mattress, so that it can be finished today." And that night, Naruto and Kurumi christened the bed, with Hinata with a clone at the room beside theirs' none the wiser.</P><P>Days gone past quickly and the weekend arrived. Hinata now stood in front of Naruto, ready to train with the seals on her body removed. And once the seals on her body are deactivated, the surge of chakra throughout her body makes her feel more powerful than ever! Combined with the fact that her body actually felt as light as a feather, she felt like she can take on anything! But Naruto grounds her back to reality, and said to Hinata, "Hina-chan, I know that the power rush due to the sealed powers are making you feel very good, but you must know that that was not the only extent of training that you will go through. You will be able to be much faster and much stronger than you are right now. So, in order to speed up your training some more, I will teach you the Shadow Clone jutsu. This jutsu drains chakra, so much so that you will definitely feel tired after making one. But this will also force your chakra coils to grow even more, and will make you exponentially stronger later on. Now, this is the handsign for the Shadow Clone jutsu. I want you to make one, and she will go to Kurumi, who will train you in sealing or chakra control, probably chakra control. So go ahead and make one."</P><P>Hinata nodded, and with a shout of "Shadow Clone jutsu!" She created a clone, which left her lying on the ground, her chakra almost completely gone. But Naruto immediately went to her help, and restored her chakra using the life force of his purified youki. Afterwards, the clone was sent towards Kurumi, who proceeds to teach her chakra control, before Naruto starts to train Hinata with the starting katas of the Gentle Fist. This went on until the evening, where with Hinata's new stamina and chakra, she managed to last until the evening. By night time, she was so tired that she didn't even feel the seals reactivate and didn't even bother to blush about hers and Naruto's nakedness within their shared futon.</P><P>Within Hinata's mind, she kept comparing the difference between the way her father-no, <I>Hiashi-san</I> now-taught her and how Naruto taught her. Hiashi-san's way of teaching her requires absolute perfection, no deviation was allowed from the katas, and no errors were tolerated. She was often punished due to mistakes that she did during the practice sessions. Naruto however, allows her to move according to how her body moves, and has no problems with mistakes. In fact, he lets them go, and if the mistake can disrupt the entire flow of the katas, he stopped her, and gently shows her the right moves, before slowly going into the katas together with her. He even acknowledges and praises her when she gets the moves right, unlike Hiashi-san who admonishes her for every mistake and didn't even say anything when she gets them right. She knows that with his guidance, she can improve even more.</P><P>Another week passes, and she was no longer ashamed over their sleeping arrangements. She even stutters less nowadays. Sometimes, she even start hugging Naruto through their And during this weekend, Naruto had a special plan for Hinata. Hinata stood in the training grounds as always, except this time, she was facing Kushina. Feeling confused, Hinata asked Kushina. "Kushi-chan, what are you doing here?"</P><P>"Dad told me to spar against Hina-mama!" she answered with her usual cheery disposition.</P><P>The answer made Hinata froze. A moment later, she unfroze herself and asked Kushina again. "Kushi-chan... what do you mean by Hina-mama?"</P><P>"Well, you're dad's second wife, so that makes you my mother as well! My real mother will be Kuru-mama!"</P><P>Hearing her answer, Hinata almost cried. She calls me her mother! Before she shook her head, slapped her face and gets ready to spar with Kushina, not knowing that Naruto was watching from afar. Both of them started to fight with each other, with Hinata's palm strikes and Kushina's punches hitting each other. But Kushina notices something strange a bit later. Hinata's strikes, although they hit, didn't feel as hard or as painful as they looked. Sure dad told her that due to her constitution, all hits would not be too hard on her, but this seems like she was holding back immensely! Backtracking, she then said, "Hina-mama! Why are you holding back?</P><P>"H-h-holding b-back? W-what do you m-mean?"</P><P>"Your attacks are not hitting me! Sure that I have a tough skin due to my bloodline, but you shouldn't hold back like that!"</P><P>"I-i-I d-don't want to hurt you! I don't want to see any of my loved ones hurt!"</P><P>"So you don't want to see me hurt?"</P><P>"Yes!"</P><P>"Then you should not be afraid to attack her at full strength." Naruto, seemingly appearing from nowhere, said.</P><P>"B-b-but..."</P><P>"Hina-chan, listen to me. If you hold back during a spar against your loved ones, they will suffer in the future. They might think that they're good enough, but when they went into the real world, they'll found out that their strength are there just because you held back against them, which will probably cause them to die, if not worse. Would you want that? Would you want their death to be on your conscience? Would you want your beloved ones to die, just because you holding back falsify their confidence on their skills? Would you?"</P><P>At this point, Hinata started crying, and Kushina went back, watching what her father would do during this condition. Naruto then went to Hinata and hugged her while stroking her hair.</P><P>"Hina-chan, you are a kind and gentle person. Don't change that. However, there are times when you should leave your gentleness behind, and show the fierce protective spirit within you. I know that you are not weak, but being gentle at the wrong moment will be our downfall, no matter how strong you are. So please, Hina-chan. Learn to leave your kindness and not hold back during training and battles, for being kind during these situations are very bad, not just for you, but also for everyone around you."</P><P>Hinata just continued to cry while Naruto hugged her and gently held her until she stopped crying. "Are you ready to continue the spar, Hina-chan?"</P><P>Wiping her tears, she went back into her initial position, with Kushina ready to spar against her again. "Don't hold back anymore, Hina-mama!"</P><P>At an unheard signal, Hinata immediately rushed towards Kushina, dealing Gentle Fist blows towards her, finally not holding back after years of doing so, though she still flinched on every hit that she dealt towards Kushina. Naruto, all the time was shouting words of encouragement towards Hinata when Kurumi appeared beside him. "So where's the real Naruto?"</P><P>"Uh... the boss is sparring with the Sandaime now, and is planning to ask him to help remove Hinata's stutter completely later, though he already said that his plans are a secret."</P><P>The spar continued for a while until the evening, where Hinata was already at a level beyond tired, while Kushina looked barely winded. <I>"I sometimes envied their bloodline..."</I> thought Hinata. She was lying down on the grassy area while watching Kurumi sparred with her daughter. She saw that Kurumi does not hold back against Kushina, not one bit. Every hit was powerful, able to break bones on regular person. Every attack was lethal. She could swear that one of Kushina's hearts stopped just now!</P><P>Suddenly, the Sandaime appeared together with Naruto, who Hiraishined inside the compound, and went directly towards Hinata.</P><P>"Hinata."</P><P>"S-s-sandaime-sama! H-h-how are you?"</P><P>"It seems that you haven't removed the stutter as of yet." Hinata blushed at this. "Though it may seem cute at first, it will damage your reputation and will cause problems if not fixed. So, Naruto gave me a good idea. He told me to have some debate sessions with you every 2 or 3 days so that you can get used to talking to people to remove your stutter, and to increase your confidence."</P><P>"T-t-thanks, Sandaime-sama."</P><P>Both of them then watched the spar between Kurumi and Kushina, watching attack by attack hitting their targets. The sight causes Hinata to think that even if her own mother didn't hold back against her, why should her? And what Naruto said was true as well. Thus, a fire was ignited within herself to push herself harder than ever, so that Naruto will be proud of her. That night, she slept, hugging clone Naruto's body with her own petite body.</P><P>The next week, after a couple of debate sessions with the Sandaime, both Kurumi and Naruto saw that Hinata's stutter has gone almost completely, and seeing that she was already unashamed with sleeping with the clone , Naruto invited Hinata to sleep together with him and Kurumi.</P><P>"But I thought Naru-kun didn't sleep."</P><P>"He didn't. It's his meditation training time."</P><P>That night, for the first time, Hinata slept together with both Naruto and Kurumi, with Naruto in the middle, Kurumi on the left and Hinata on the right. Watching the two of them naked made Naruto horny and Hinata blushing, but at least Naruto can control himself to not jump Kurumi right away and Hinata didn't faint, which was a great milestone for her.</P><P>After another week, Hinata's chakra has grown immensely due to the training she was put through, and so does her stamina and speed. Her chakra was now at chuunin levels, and her speed was at jounin level, allowing her to learn the more advanced katas of the Gentle Fist from Naruto. Unknown to her, Naruto has been sending Henge'd Shadow Clones to the Hyuuga clan's compound to either watch their training, or to copy secret Hyuuga techniques and to update him of their current condition. From his spying effort, he found out that Hyuuga Neji was chosen as the new heir for the Hyuuga due to his prodigious skill within the Gentle Fist, and will be married to Hanabi when she comes of age. He kept this fact a secret from Hinata, especially when his clones caught Hanabi crying within her room about her banishment and the elder's failed plans and the subsequent disappearance of five Hyuuga clan Main Family members.</P><P>After another week, Hinata has improved by leaps and bounds. She no longer stutters, and is capable of debating with Hiruzen on various matters well. <I>"Guess the training that Naruto gave her really worked wonders. Though I need to ponder, what kind of training did Naruto put her through to make her improve this much in such a short time."</I> Hiruzen thought. She also no longer hold back when in spars, thus Naruto decides to go to the next stage of her training. "Hina-chan, tonight, you'll sleep with us again, right?"</P><P>"Yes. Why?"</P><P>"Nothing, just thinking of a surprise."</P><P>That night, Hinata was about to sleep while cuddling to Naruto again when suddenly, Naruto moved towards Kurumi and kissed her sensually, their tongue's waging a war with each other. This sight causes Hinata to gape while having a huge blush on her face. When Naruto starts kissing Kurumi's neckline while their hands are busy touching the other's body, Hinata felt herself get hotter for some reason unknown. She then gasped when Naruto started suckling on Kurumi's perk breasts, feeling her own stood up for some reason. And somehow, she finds herself not being able to remove her eyes from this scene in front of her. When the both of them got naked and Naruto's 8" dick was showing with Kurumi's own nicely shaven pussy, Hinata felt a weird heat rise from her loins, and had the feeling to rub it. When Naruto started to eat Kurumi out and Kurumi was letting out moans and growls of pleasure, Hinata was sure her breasts felt different. She then starts to rub them, and gasped at the sudden feeling of delicious pleasure that came from the simple act. After a while, Naruto started to penetrate Kurumi and Hinata, still watching this, felt the pull to rub her own pussy. Then Naruto started to piston out of Kurumi's pussy, with Kurumi screaming in pleasure, Hinata was busy rubbing her pussy, the weird, pleasurable feeling kept building up to a crescendo within her. And when Naruto and Kurumi climaxed, she came as well, spraying her maiden cum all over the bed. Huffing and panting, Kurumi approached Hinata and started licking her pussy, sending even more of the jolts of pleasure that she felt before towards her, while Naruto started suckling on her left A-cup breast while his other hand played with the other mound. The combinations of sensations are too much for Hinata, who came again with Kurumi greedily lapping the juices from her pussy. Licking her lips, she then said to Naruto, "Guess she had her first experience in orgasming."</P><P>"Yeah. And if all goes well, she will feel it even more before we even entered the academy, though I'm not sure whether we'll go into outright sex or not," said Naruto, while watching the flushed, panting face of Hinata.</P><P>Meanwhile within Hinata's mind, she was overcome with the greatest sensation she had ever felt in her life! Not just that she saw Naruto having sex with Kurumi, something also happened to her which causes her to... do what she just did! And it was great! Oh so great! And it is even more so when Kurumi did it with her tongue! She never felt better! Though it also causes her to become sleepy, and she can't hold it any longer...</P><P>Naruto and Kurumi just laughed when they saw that Hinata has fallen asleep after her first and second orgasm. They both then promised to continue doing so to her again and again, until she truly became a part of their family.</P><P>Another two week passed, and Hinata's confidence was sky high. The acts that she saw (and was being done on her) every night made her reasons to be ashamed all the time seems miniscule in comparison. Also, at one night, the two 'attacked' her, with them taking turns eating her out. The sheer pleasure from their acts made her fall into a blissful coma, causing Naruto to say to Kurumi that definitely, sex can change someone, even though it is just oral sex. They haven't taken the next step, because Hinata didn't allow it yet, still not comfortable with the idea of penetration, though she joins them sometimes during their sexual activities, though only a bit lightly. Nowadays, she even cuddled at night during her sleep, with Naruto just meditating and resting, though he didn't actually need to. This massive increase in confidence in Hinata causes her skills to rise as well, and combined with her newfound strength to not hold back during spars, causes her to improve massively, due to her training and seals applied on her.</P><P>And one week before the academy starts, the only Gentle Fist skill that she needs to learn are the forbidden and advanced ones, like the Rotation, Sixty Four Palms and the Air Palms. Her sparring with both Kurumi and Kushina had made her even stronger, and they also praised her increase in skills, with them discovering something important about the Astartes bloodline. Their chakra armour training, a method to create subdermal chakra armour to take any attacks, also causes their tenketsus to be invisible, though it is probably due to the sheer amount of chakra that they use as armour.</P><P>A week before the academy starts, Naruto talked to Hinata about her entrance into the academy. "Hina-chan, I suggest that you still have the markings of the Caged Bird seal on your forehead, so that any Hyuuga that saw you on the road will not be able to say that you have removed the seal. Besides, it will be a good way to trick them later on."</P><P>Hinata just nodded, which Naruto took as a sign of acceptance towards the idea, and immediately started to unseal his sealing set before making the markings of the Caged Bird seal on her forehead to trick any Hyuuga that she saw.</P><P>"Hina-chan, are you okay with the decision to enter the academy? You know that you didn't really have to, the skills that you've shown in front of the Sandaime and I should be enough for you to not need the academy to be a ninja."</P><P>"No, Naru-kun. Since you entered the academy because you didn't want to be fast tracked into the ninja system, and if me, as your wife, would do otherwise, then it would be hypocritical of me won't it?"</P><P>Naruto just sighed while having a smile on his face. His second wife's newfound determination and strength are something that cannot be seen on regular people, making him wonder how Hiashi not saw the strength that Hinata, despite her small stature and initially timid behaviour, have. An idiot will keep being and idiot, Naruto muses.</P><P>"Well, then go ahead and do whatever." But suddenly a massive wave of KI came from him, causing even Hinata to shake. "But if someone were to attack you when I can see it, that person is dead. Understood?"</P><P>"Don't worry, Naru-kun. I can protect myself now, thanks to your training. And if things go from bad to worse, I can just call you using the Hiraishin seal, remember?"</P><P>"Yeah, but I'm still worried. Even Kushi-chan is worried of you, of her Hina-mama, even when she didn't need to, knowing your strength."</P><P>"*giggles* You guys are a bunch of worrywarts. I will have no problems to go against them all. And I will keep activating the seals, if not just to train myself even when we're still learning in the academy."</P><P>"Well, let's go now." Naruto said, when Kurumi suddenly piped in. "Wait!" she said, running from the back of the house, before jumping towards Hinata and started kissing the air out of her. After an impromptu make out session in front of the teleport seal that causes Hinata to blush and Kurumi to say "I always know that Naru-koi had a god eye for a mate. Your lips are delicious!" and Naruto to gain an instant boner watching his two wives kissing the crap out of each other, Naruto, with Kushina on his shoulder and Hinata beside him, teleported to their fake apartment, and started to walk towards the academy, with the people, so much friendlier now due to Kushina's cuteness and Naruto's different looks, greeting them and waving at them.</P><P>-BREAK-</P><P>The chuunin, acting as a teacher of the academy class which has the most number of clan heirs this year, Umino Iruka, was having a very bad bay. He woke up, got shocked by static electricity at his toilet's door knob, found out that his coffee was out, he lost his favourite shoes, he was going to have new students within his class today and now, his class of mostly clan heirs are causing a massive ruckus within the class when he told them that there will be new students that skipped a year, and was approved by the Sandaime himself. His anger reached a peak, and with that, he exploded. Using his Big Head jutsu to increase the size of his head to massively comical proportions, he screamed towards the future ninjas. "SILENCE! ALL OF YOU! THE NEW STUDENT HASN'T EVEN ARRIVED YET AND ALL OF YOU HAVE BEEN SHOUTING ABOUT HIM! WAIT UNTIL HE ARRIVES AND-" his tirade was cut short by a knock from behind the sliding doors to the classroom. He then opened the doors, and his eyes widened hugely, before he faces the class.</P><P>"Everyone, I guess that the new students have arrived, and I will invite them in now."</P><P>With that, a huge hand grabbed the side of the door, before a person with red hair was forced to duck into the room, which people then saw that the red haired person was actually a kid sitting on the shoulders of a blonde giant with sky blue eyes and three whisker marks on his cheeks wearing an unzipped black jumpsuit with the Uzumaki spiral on its back, showing his tight black muscle shirt that shows his tough muscles, with a pair of black pants and covered black shoes. The red haired kid sitting on his head was a girl with blue eyes and three whisker marks as well on her face, while wearing a simple white shirt and blue combat pants with shoulder length hair. Behind them both, a small kid who looked the same age as the clan heirs followed them inside, her dark blue hair, pupilless white eyes and white skin contrasting against her black jacket, zipped unlike her husband's, hiding her budding body and makes her look even smaller than what she was, with her black pants and black covered shoes completing her all black assemble. All three of them than stood in front of the class, and after a moment, Naruto took the silence from the class as an invitation to introduce himself and his family towards the class.</P><P>"Hello everyone. My name is Uzumaki Naruto, this girl on my shoulder is my daughter, Uzumaki Kushina, and this girl beside me," he said while holding her shoulders and pulling her closer to him, "Is Uzumaki Hinata, my second wife. A pleasure to meet you all. Please take care of me." Naruto said while bowing, causing all two, even Kushina who was sitting on his shoulders to bow down.</P><P>The entire class was silent after this introduction, and after a couple of seconds, a reply was heard from everyone.</P><P>"WHAT!?"</P><P>-CHAPTER ENDS-</P><P>Whew! Finally the chapter ends! The academy starts now, with a timeskip in the future, either in the next chapter or the next two chaps. As always, read and review! renegadeofficer89, signing out.</P>
