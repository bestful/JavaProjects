He saw a pair of blue eyes that could rival even the sky's beauty and sun-kissed hair that illuminates the night. He had a lithe body with enough tan to make him attractive.</p><p>.</p><p>He should be happy. He should be rejoicing. But he cannot. On the day that the Akatsuki have been defeated, he must leave. He must go back to his home. His duty has been fulfilled, his promise to protect the blonde and Konohagakure as a promise to the Yondaime.</p><p>.</p><p>How he will miss him. For three years since he was able to be free of his sealing, their attraction grew. Until a year ago, they confessed of their love for the other…</p><p>.</p><p>They were happy. But now, no more…</p><p>.</p><p>He is a demon. And a demon cannot stay with a human lover lest he will drain the life out of the blonde. His demon powers will poison them all and he cannot have that. No, he will not accept that. His love for the blonde will not allow him. So, he must go.</p><p>.</p><p>At midnight, the demon left. Leaving behind a note:</p><p>.</p><p>Naruto,</p><p>.</p><p>My love, a gift for you</p><p>My soul, bound to you</p><p>My heart, tied with you</p><p>My time, I leave to you</p><p>.</p><p>I am sorry but I must go. Leave you to live the life that you wanted. You realized it already, don't you? You are getting sick because of me. You are getting weaker because my chakra poisons you. My presence alone weakens you. You will die if I don't go away.</p><p>.</p><p>It hurts, it hurts so much. I found love but I also found a void. I love you but I must leave you. Is this what love is? Sacrificing for your love? Letting them go?</p><p>.</p><p>If this is love, then I can be happy. I know you'll be strong. I know you will grow up.</p><p>.</p><p>Please don't forget.</p><p>The time a man tames the beast is when the beast begins to love his man.</p><p>.</p><p>Love,</p><p>Kyuubi</p>
