Leaving Konoha & Gaining a Friend</P><P>Naruto was
walking around. It's been 3 days since he became a shinobi, 3 days
since he defeated Mizuki, 3 days since he stole the forbidden scroll.
It's been 3 days since the incident. Most of all it's been 3 days
since he learnt of Kyuubi. (Some people only believe he learned the
Kage Bushin, what most people don't know is that he copied all the
techniques down & got a couple of scrolls.)</P><P><U>Flashback to
3 days ago</U></P><P><U>"Man,
that was too easy. Who knew the Hokage was a pervert?" Naruto
said to himself. He opened the forbidden scroll. He looked at the
first jutsu. "Kage Bushin? Ah man, bushin is my worse ninjustu.
All well...Hey I should copy all these down" Naruto said as he
then copied each justu down & any info on the side. He then got
to one that was a bloodseal. He put some blood on it & 2 scrolls
popped out. Each had his name on them. "Hmm...I wonder what
these are?" he said as he put them in his pocket for later.</U></P><P>After that
happened Iruka showed up & Mizuki told him everything. Naruto was
upset, but happy to gain a friend in Iruka. Iruka had gave Naruto his
hitei-ite. Naruto was place on Team 7 with Sakura & Sasuke. Their
Sensei was Kakashi. All they ever did was D-ranks. Mostly chasing a
devil cat named Tora that was the Daimayo's wife's cat (should be
counted as a S-rank). Tora likes Naruto however, so he never gets
scratched up.</P><P>*Later that
night*</P><P>Naruto was
sitting on his bed. He turned off his light then went to sleep.</P><P>~Mindscape~</P><P>Naruto woke up
to see he was in a sewer of some kind. He looked around all he could
see were pipes on the walls & ceiling. Water was on the floor and
it went to his ankles. He wasn't even wet. "What the hell? Where
am I?" he asked no one in particular. He then saw some red
chakra and followed it. He came upon a room with a cage. There was no
lock or anything. The only thing keeping it closed was a peace of
paper with the kanji for 'seal'. Naruto peered inside. Two huge red
slitted eyes opened up & looked at Naruto. "Uh...You must be
Kyuubi!" Naruto said.</P><P>Kyuubi nodded.
<B>"I've been waiting to meet you Uzumaki Naruto."</B>
"Uh...you have?" Naruto asked. <B>"Yes. You see I
attacked Konoha because someone named Orochimaru attacked me, I'm
sorry." </B>"Uh...I forgive you" Naruto said. <B>"In
fact, if you want I'll be your friend & train you!"</B>
"Really? Thanks!" Naruto said smiling. <B>"By the way,
I'm a girl."</B> Naruto gawked & Kyuubi snickered. "What's
your real name, then?" Naruto asked. <B>"Kidara."</B>
Naruto nodded and smiled.</P><P>~Real world,
next day~</P><P>Naruto was
walking by the council room when he heard something he didn't want to
hear. "We need to kill him Sarutobi! Naruto is a monster! He
needs to die!" said a council man. "No! He is the hero! He
will stay!" Sarutobi argued. Naruto looked down & left. <I>'If
they don't want me here, then I'll leave!'</I> Naruto thought. He
went to his apartment, wrote a letter to Sarutobi, packed up his
belongings, took the letter & put it on Sarutobi's desk, then
left the village.</P><P>~Sarutobi's
office~</P><P>Sarutobi walked
into his office as he sighed in frustration. <I>'Why can't they see
that Naruto-kun is not the Kyuubi! Hm...what's this?'</I> Sarutobi
thought as he opened the letter & read it.</P><P><I><U>Dear
Jii-san,</U></I></P><P><I><U>I'm sorry
to say, but I've left the village. I can't take it anymore. Please
don't make me a missing nin. I'm still loyal to Konoha. It's more
like I won't be living in the village, but will remain a shinobi. If
you need me, you can contact me. I'll tell you where I live once I'm
settled. </U></I></P><P><I><U>I may have
other village hitei-ite, but if that village & Konoha ever go to
war I will choose Konoha everytime! As long as I have precious people
in Konoha like you, Iruka-sensei, Teuchi-jii-san, Ayame-chan I will
protect Konoha. Tell Hinata-chan that I'm sorry & that I'll see
her again. By the way I meet Kyuubi. Turns out she attacked Konoha,
because Orochimaru attacked her. Yes, she. Kyuubi is a girl & a
good friend.</U></I></P><P><I><U>Love ya
always,</U></I></P><P><I><U>Naruto
Uzumaki</U></I></P><P><I><U>P.s. I'll
miss you.</U></I></P><P>Sarutobi fell
down with tears in his eyes. <I>'Don't worry Naruto-kun! You will not
be a nuke-nin. Kyuubi keep him safe'</I> Sarutobi thought while
silently crying. Team 7 walked in. "Hey Hokage-sama! Naruto's
sick so he won't be joining us" Kakashi said. "Kakashi,
he's not sick" Sarutobi thought.</P><P>Sakura &
Sasuke's eyebrows shot up. "Oh?" Kakashi asked. "He
left the village. He probably won't be coming back either"
Sarutobi said surprising them. "Sasuke, Sayuri has woken up.
She'll take Naruto's place" Sarutobi said. Sasuke was surprised.
His sister was alive & in a coma, now she's awakened? He nodded.</P>

He was now in wave walking around when he heard about Gato & what's he doing. He heard about Tazuna building a bridge to set them free. Naruto walked to Tazuna's house. He knocked on the door and heard a 'Come in'. He went in to see a family eating dinner. There was a old man, a young woman, and a boy. "Um, hello?" Naruto asked. The family looked at him.</p><p>Naruto walked over to the old man. "Are you Tazuna?" he asked. "Yea, so what?" the old man asked. "I could take care of Gato for you, if you like" Naruto said. "What can you do, your just a kid!" the woman said. "Um...maybe I am, but I am a shinobi" Naruto said. Everyone there sat in shock.</p><p>"Could you really get rid of Gato? I don't have anything to pay you with however" Tazuna said. "Yea I can. If I could stay here for a few days, that would be enough" Naruto said. Tazuna nodded. "Oh right. We haven't introduced ourselves. As you know I'm Tazuna. This is my daughter Tsunami & my grandson Inari" Tazuna said. "My name is Uzumaki Naruto" Naruto said. They nodded & Tsunami blushed. Tazuna & Inari caught it. Inari told Naruto everything that happened.</p><p>*The next day*</p><p>Naruto was walking aound town. He was looking for Gato's mansion when he found Gato with his thugs lounging around. "GATO!!" Naruto yelled causing all of them to look at him. "It's just a kid" said one thug. "Look again, baka. He's wearing one of those hitei-ite's. That kid's a shinobi!" said another thug. Before any could blink Naruto sliced Gato's head off with a kunai. "Leave wave & never come back!" Naruto growled out. The thugs screamed and left.</p><p>Naruto heard cheering so he looked up to see all of wave there. "Thank you, Naruto-kun! You saved us!" Tsunami said kissing his cheek making him blush. "Are you still building the bridge, Tazuna-san?" Naruto asked. Tazuna nodded. Naruto followed him to the bridge. He then used Tajuu Kage Bushin. The bridge was made in a few hours. The villagers named the bridge the 'Great Naruto Bridge' after their hero. That day Naruto became Wave's Hero.</p><p>~Tazuna's House~</p><p>Naruto was up stairs in the guestroom. He got out the scrolls and opened the first.</p><p><i><u>Dear Naruto-kun,</u></i></p><p><i><u>I hope the villagers treated you well. I also hope you opened this scroll before your dads. Anyway my name is Uzumaki Kushina. I was a anbu captain. I'm afraid I died in childbirth, sorry. I hope the villagers treated you right. I originally came from Uzu no Kuni. At the bottom of the scroll is a bloodseal holding some of my belongings. I will always love you. Don't let anything get you down. Fill your dreams & gain friends. Don't ever lose your precious people. By the way if you love orange & are a bit of a loud mouth you get it from me.</u></i></p><p><i><u>The Uzumaki's Kekkai Genkai is the Nentou Soshi. It allows the user read minds, speak telepathy, and have telekinesis. We can even locate people by their chakra or energy signatures. We can also break into a person's mental barrier. This bloodline is a upgrade of the demon eye, Jagan. It still hates being insulted however. It gives the user super strength, high chakra control, manipulation over shadows & poison, immunity to all poisons except your own. They can summon weapons from a dimension storage & they are the best kenjustu experts. The only difference is that your immune to all poisons, including your own & once you know the dimensional storage you can pull anything from it not just weapons. You get your high stamina from here. We can use the darkness flame element. Though it is rare to find in our clan. The last person who had it was 500 years ago.</u></i></p><p><i><u>Always live the way you want.</u></i></p><p><i><u>Love your mother,</u></i></p><p><i><u>Uzumaki Kushina, Konoha's Aka Shikyou</u></i></p><p><i><u>p.s. Please don't hate your father, he did what he had to do.</u></i></p><p>Naruto had tears in his eyes, but was confused by the last statement. He figured he find out when he reads his father's will. He put his blood on the bloodseal & a few things popped out. There was a beautifully made katana. It had a pure silver blade.</p><p>The hilt was black with crimson gems. The sheath was black & looked to have 9 tails wrapping around. It was called Maelstrom. There was also a kusari-gama, a scroll on the dimesional storage, & a few pictures of his mother. One in a jounin outfit, one as a kid, & one in a anbu outfit. He then opened his father's will.</p><p><i><u>Hey Kiddo,</u></i></p><p><i><u>I'm sorry for what I'm about to do, but there's no other way to defeat Kyuubi then seal it inside you. Please Forgive me. I want the village to treat you as a hero, but I bet they won't. Anyway, below is a bloodseal to hold a few of my belongings. Always protect your precious people & don't ever doubt your self. By the way if ya love pranks and/or ramen it comes from me. I'll always be watching you along with my Kushi-chan. I understand if you hate me.</u></i></p><p><i><u>The Namikaze Kekkai Genkai is the Chisoku Chakra. It let's us disappear in flashes/blurs. It gives us super speed, high stamina, & huge chakra reserves. Also our intellegence is off the charts, We can also break down seals by looking at it & have photographic memory.</u></i></p><p><i><u>Remember, Don't Ever doubt & make your own nindo.</u></i></p><p><i><u>Love your father, </u></i></p><p><i><u>Namikaze Minato, Konoha's Kiiro Senkou & Yondaime Hokage</u></i></p><p><i><u>p.s. Any extra seals I put on you like the one to hide your intellegence will disappear when you go to sleep after reading this letter. Don't forget your mother & I love you very much. You are also last of clan, so you get a harem.</u></i></p><p>Naruto now was completely in tears. His father was the very man who sealed Kidara in him. He doesn't hate him though. He put his blood on the seal & out popped a few of his father's belongings. There were a few pics of him. Some as a child, some jounin, some anbu, even some Hokage. There was even a pic of him & Kushina, and one of him, Kushina, & baby Naruto. There was his father's jutsu scroll & some 3-pronged kunai.</p><p><b>"Um...kit?"</b> Kidara said. <i>'Yea, Kidara?'</i> Naruto asked. <b>"I forgot to tell you that I gave you a bloodline. It's active too. In fact they all are."</b> <i>'What's it do?'</i> Naruto asked. <b>"It's called Kihakugan. It can copy bloodlines, contol all elements, control souls, manupilate shadows, do jutsu without handseals if used enough, heal instantly, & have enhanced senses. Also bloodlines are ineffective against you."</b> Naruto blinked. <i>'Cool!'</i> Naruto exclaimed to her. Kidara smiled from within her cage. Naruto then went to try the bloodline out. He somehow combined them all. He called it the Hakumeigan. After 3 days he left wave.</p><p>-</p><p>Kihakugan- Soul Eye</p><p>Hakumeigan- Twilight Eye</p><p>Chisoku Chakra- Speed Chakra</p><p>Nentou Soshi- Mind Element</p><p>Konoha's Kiiro Senkou- Konoha's Yellow Flash</p><p>Konoha's Aka Shikyou- Konoha's Red Death</p>

There were 5 men, a boy, & a girl. Two of the men were were brothers. <i>'Uh Oh'</i> Naruto though as he scratched his head in a sheepish manor. <b>"Hey, kit!" </b>Kidara called. <i>'Yea?'</i> Naruto asked. <b>"That girl. She's a jinchuuriki like you."</b></p><p>Naruto looked to the girl. <i>'Hey your right! But her seal's not as good. I better fix it. Thanks for showing me how to change a seal to the shiki fuin seal.'</i> <b>"No Problem."</b> (An: If someone already has a seal, then when Naruto changes it to Shiki Fuin he won't have to give up his soul to Shinigami.)</p><p>Naruto walked over to them. "Hey!" he called out. They looked at him. "What do you want, Gaki?" asked one of the men. The man had bandages around his lower half of his face. Naruto twitched. "I was just wondering what you guys are doing here?" Naruto asked. "It's none of your business!" said a shark-like man.</p><p>"Yea, besides your a Konoha nin. We're Kiri nins!" said the brothers. "Guys, he might be able to help" said the girl. She had a hunter-nin mask in her hand. The other man just drank his tea while the boy layed down. Naruto nodded. "Your a jinchuuriki, right miss?" Naruto asked the girl. She was shocked, but nodded. The first guy got up. "How do you know that, gaki?" he asked as he glared at Naruto. Naruto held up his hands in a surrender motion. "I'm also a jinchuuriki. I could fix her seal" he said. The girl was surprised but nodded. "Would you please fix the seal?" she asked.</p><p>Naruto nodded. "What are your names?" Naruto asked as he started to fix her seal. "Momochi Zabuza" said the guy with the bandages. "Hoshigaki Kisame" replied the shark-like guy. "Meizu" "Gozo" came the brothers's reply. "Kuroski Raiga" came the reply from the guy drinking. "I'm Ranmaru" came the boy's reply. "My name is Haku & I'm Gobi's Jinchuuriki" said the girl. Naruto nodded.</p><p>"I'm Namikaze Uzumaki Naruto. I'm Kyuubi's jinchuuriki" he said surprising them. "Namikaze? As in Namikaze Minato? The Kiiro Senkou?" Zabuza asked. "You knew my dad?" Naruto asked with a raised eyebrow shocking them all. "We faught together in war once, actually he would prank me whenever he could" Zabuza said. Naruto laughed. "Yea, I left Konoha because I couldn't take it anymore" Naruto said. They nodded. They told Naruto everything, like how they were going to kill the Mizukage for everything he ever did. Naruto agreed to help them.</p><p>*3 days later*</p><p>They were currently training. "Itai!" Naruto said when Zabuza hit him in the face with Kubiki Honcho. Kisame snickered & the demon brothers laughed. "If you don't dodge this or work properly I will give you a lovely funeral" Raiga said. Haku & Ranmaru watched on. Naruto raised a eyebrow. "I like to see you try" he said & dodged a lightning bolt.</p><p>* A month later*</p><p>The ex-kiri nins & Naruto were currently fighting the Mizukage. <i>'Forget this!' </i>Naruto thought as he impaled the Mizukage with Maelstrom. Everyone from Kiri were watching. "Hurray!" they said. "Would you like to be Mizukage?" one of the kiri shinobi asked Naruto. "Nah! Zabuza can be Mizukage!" Naruto said. The shinobi nodded. A few days later Naruto left kiri with a golden kiri hitei-ite & a kiss on the cheek from Haku. Zabuza sent a letter to the hokage.</p><p>~Kumo~</p><p>Naruto was walking around when he heard perverted giggling. He followed it to see a old man with long white hair peeping on the girls side of the hotspring. "PERVERT!!!!" Naruto screamed. The women screamed & beat up the old man. They then thanked Naruto & left.</p><p>A girl walked over to Naruto. She was one of the girls who were bathing. (She wears what she does in the anime) "Thanks for busting the perv. Name's Nii Yugito" she said. Her blond hair soaked & her slitted purple eyes sparkling. "No problem. Name's Namikaze Uzumaki Naruto" Naruto said. She nodded. They talked while walking to the Raikage's office.</p><p>Naruto found out that Yugito was a genin & the Raikage's daughter. He also found out that she was Nibi's Jinchuuriki & her life. She found out about him as well. When they walked into the raikage's office, a woman greeted them. She had blond hair & purple eyes. She looked like a older version of Yugito (by the way Yugito is 16).</p><p>"My name is Nii Hera. I heard you busted a pervert. Thank you" she said. "No problem, ma'am" he said as she smiled. She then gave him a gold kumo hitei-ite. Just then the perverted old man shushined in. "My apologies Raikage-sama, but may I see Naruto?" he asked. "Sure Jiraiya" she said. Naruto waved to Yugito then followed the man. Hera then sent a letter to the Hokage.</p><p>~Elsewhere~</p><p>Naruto & Jiraiya stopped in a training field. "Alright, how do you know me?" Naruto asked. "I am Jiraiya the toad sage. I was the one who trained the Yondaime." Naruto looked at him. "You trained my father?" he asked. Jiraiya was shocked, but nodded. "You know your heritage?" he asked.</p><p>Naruto nodded. "Um...by the way, I'm your godfather" Jiraiya said. "Where were you?!" Naruto yelled. "I'm sorry, I was keeping an eye on the Akatsuki. Please forgive me" Jiraiya said. Naruto sighed but nodded. Jiraiya then trained Naruto in fuinjutsu.</p><p>*A month later*</p><p>Naruto was walking around. He had fixed Yugito's seal. Yugito introduced him to Kirabi the Hachibi container who loves to rap. He was a genin as well. Naruto also fixed Kirabi's seal. Now he was in iwa. He had separated from Jiraiya last week. As he was walking he heard some sobbing. He turned the corner to see some people beating up a girl his age. "Hey! Stop that!" he called. The shinobi looked towards him.</p><p>They were iwa nuke-nins. "Why should we, brat?" the ninja asked. Naruto sighed. He then used Fuuton: Slicing Gale on the shinobi killing them. He walked over to the girl. "Hey, you okay?" he asked. She looked up & nodded.</p><p>She had orange hair with black streaks & gold eyes. She wore a black tanktop, anbu style pants, black shinobi sandals, & a black iwa hitei-ite on her forehead. (Her bangs look like Sasuke's) "Y-Yea. Thanks!" she said. "No problem. What's your name?" he asked her. "It's Kitada Kisa" she said.</p><p>Naruto nodded. "I'm Namikaze Uzumaki Naruto. Hey Kisa why did those guys hurt you?" he asked. "Well, I'm the Jinchuuriki of the Shichibi no Tora, the seven-tailed tiger. I am also the Tsuchikage's neice. No one in Iwa hates me for being a Jinchuuriki" she said. Naruto nodded.</p><p>"I'm the Jinchuuriki of Kyuubi & son of the Yondaime Hokage. Not that anyone cares" he told her making her laugh. They walked to the Tsuchikage's office. "Um...uncle?" Kisa called out. "Right here Kisa" the Tsuchikage said as he walked out. He had orange hair & gold eyes. He saw Naruto & raised an eyebrow. <i>'Hmm? He kinda looks like Minato'</i> the Tsuchikage thought.</p><p>Kisa looked at her uncle. "This is Naruto. He saved me from some nuke-nins. He's even my friend" she said. The Tsuchikage laughed. Naruto looked at him as did Kisa. "I see. My name is Kitada Koyuro. You must be Namikaze Minato's son" he said smirking. Naruto paled & backed up a little. Kisa was confused. "Yea I am. So what?" Naruto asked.</p><p>Koyuro smiled. "Nothing. I faught your father. You look just like him with whiskers. I'm guessing he sealed Kyuubi in you?" he asked. Naruto nodded. "Um...Who's Namikaze Minato?" Kisa asked. "Konoha's Kiiro Senkou" Koyuro said shocking her. "Don't worry Naruto-kun, I won't tell anyone. Your welcome by me. Here" he said throwing a gold Iwa hitei-ite at him.</p><p>Just then the door opened. "You called me, un?" said a voice. Kisa & Naruto looked to it to see a man with blond hair & blue eyes. He also had mouths on his hands. "Deidara-senpai!" Kisa called glomping the jounin. Deidara smirked. "Hello, Kisa. How have you been, un?" he ased. "Just fine. Oh this is Namikaze Uzumaki Naruto! He saved me!" she said.</p><p>Deidara looked at him. "You look like Minato" Deidara said. "Well, he is his son" Koyuro said. Deidara nodded he then got his mission & left. Just then the door opened & two women walked in. One had long golden blond hair & gold eyes. The other had black hair and black eyes.</p><p>She was holding a pig. "Hello Koyuro-sama. You requested me?" asked the blond. "Yes, I did. I was going to ask if you could train Kisa, but do you think you could train Kisa & Naruto?" Koyuro asked. Naruto was shocked. The blond nodded. Then Naruto, Kisa, the two women & the pig left. Koyuro sent a letter to the Hokage.</p><p>~Training area~</p><p>The blond moved. "Okay first let's introduce ourselves. I'm Tsunade, the Slug sannin" the blond said. "My name is Shizune. I'm Tsunade's apprentice. The pig is Ton-ton" said the black haired chick. "I'm Kisa. Jinchuuriki to Shichibi. Tsuchikage's neice" Kisa said as she bowed. "Namikaze Uzumaki Naruto. Kyuubi's Jinchuuriki & Yondaime Hokage's son" he said. Tsunade & Shizune were shocked. "We will be teaching you guys iijutsu" Shizune said. Naruto & Kisa nodded.</p><p>*5 hours later*</p><p>Naruto & Kisa were walking around. They just finished training for the day. "Ne, Naruto-kun. I want to introduce you to some people" she said. Naruto nodded. They walked to a compound. "This is the home of the Kamizuru Clan. Like the Aburame clan, they also use bugs. They just use bees more" Kisa said. "I see" he said. Just then 3 people walked up. 2 guys & a girl. One guy had blond hair & the other had black hair.</p><p>The girl had brown hair. "Ah, Kisa-chan? What do we owe this visit?" the girl asked. "I'm showing my friend around" Kisa said. The girl nodded. "I'm Kamizuru Suzumebachi" the girl said. "Kamizuru Jibachi" said the blond. "Kamizuru Kurobachi" said the black-haired guy. Naruto nodded. "Namikaze Uzumaki Naruto" he introduced. "Your the Kiiro Senkou's son?" Suzumebachi asked. "Hai" Naruto said. They nodded and showed him around. The bees liked him (then again so does the Aburame's bugs & Inuzuka's dogs.)</p><p>*A month later*</p><p>The training went by fast. Even Deidara trained them when he could. Well it was more like they had to dodge his bombs. Naruto even fixed Kisa's seal. He had separated from everyone & was walking around in Suna. Tsunade had given Naruto her necklace.</p><p>He walked to the park to see a red haired boy next to a blond girl. The boy had a gourd & the girl a fan. Naruto walked over to them, only to dodge the oncoming sand. "I'm guessing your the Ichibi no Shukaku's jinchuuriki?" Naruto asked him. The boy nodded then sent more sand.</p><p>Naruto suddenly did some hand seals then slammed his hand on the boy's seal. His hand glowed for a minute then died down. The boy tried to see if he could hear Shukaku, but he couldn't. He smiled which freaked the girl out. "What did you do?" the boy asked.</p><p>Naruto smiled. "I fixed your seal. You should now have complete control over the sand & be able to sleep" Naruto said shocking the duo. In the next minute Naruto was being hugged by the girl. She thanked him.</p><p>Naruto nodded. "What are your names anyway?" Naruto asked. "Subaku no Gaara" said the red head. "Subaku no Temari" said the blond. They headed to the Kazekage's office. Naruto had befriended Gaara & Temari. On the way there he meet their brother Kankuro.</p><p>After they told Kankuro who thanked Naruto & befriended him as well they continued their way. They told the Kazekage everything and he thanked Naruto. Naruto suggested he try to be a better parent & he agreed. He handed Naruto a gold hitei-ite. After the 4 left, the Kazekage (his name will be Kauro) sent a letter to the hokage.</p><p>~Hokage's office~</p><p>Sarutobi was looking through the mail when he saw letters from the Kages. He opened the one from the Mizukage first.</p><p><i><u>Hokage-sama,</u></i></p><p><i><u>My name is Momochi Zabuza. Our old Mizukage was a tyrant so we killed him. I have meet one of your shinobi. Uzumaki Naruto. He is now a honory Kiri member. He was the one to actually kill the Mizukage. He was even offered to become the Mizukage, but he refused. He knows his heritage, because he took the wills. He now goes by Namikaze Uzumaki Naruto. He told me about his bloodlines. Kisame & I taught him some water justu and kenjustu while Haku, my adopted daughter taught him some ice jutsu. Naruto had combined all 3 bloodlines and called it the Hakumeigan. By the way Haku was a jinchuuriki & Naruto fixed her seal. I'm writing this as a letter & to ask for a alliance. I have a feeling Naruto will end up marrying Haku.</u></i></p><p><i><u>Momochi Zabuza the Yondaime Mizukage</u></i></p><p>Then there was a section for the bloodlines. He then opened the Raikage's letter.</p><p><i><u>Hokage-sama,</u></i></p><p><i><u>How's it been? I've meet Namikaze Naruto. He is great friends with my daughter Yugito. She is the Nibi's jinchuuriki, but he fixed her seal. He also fixed Kirabi's seal. He is the Hachibi's container. I know he will probably marry my Yugi-chan. I was hoping for a alliance with Konoha. He had busted a pervert & is now a honory member. Hope to hear from you soon,</u></i></p><p><i><u>Nii Hera the Yondaime Raikage</u></i></p><p>Sarutobi smiled then opened the Tsuchikage's letter.</p><p><i><u>Hokage-sama,</u></i></p><p><i><u>It's been a while. Namikaze Naruto had saved my neice from some nuke-nins earlier this morning & befriended her. He even fixed her seal. Yes, I know his heritage as do a couple of my shinobi. We don't care however. I was hoping to have an alliance with you. Oh and Naruto is now a honory member. I asked someone earlier to train him & my neice. I really do think he will end up marrying Kisa. Write soon, old man.</u></i></p><p><i><u>Koyuro the Yondaime Tsuchikage</u></i></p><p>Sarutobi laughed then opened the Kazekage's letter.</p><p><i><u>Hokage-sama,</u></i></p><p><i><u>How are you? Namikaze Naruto meet my children & fixed Gaara's seal so he is now a honory member. He even befriended them. He then told me to change my ways & act like a father and not just a kage. I agreed. He is so much like his old man, its not funny. No doubt my daughter will end up married to him. Hope to see you sometime. I would like to redo the alliance between us.</u></i></p><p><i><u>Kauro the Yondaime Kazekage</u></i></p><p>Sarutobi smiled. He accepted all alliances & wrote the reply. 'You really outdid yourself Naruto'. He thought.</p><p>*A month later*</p><p>The group has been training, but Naruto had to leave. He meet Uchiha Itachi & Hidan of the Akatsuki. He had accidently copied Itachi's sharigan, but him & his children will get mangekyou after a year of mastering the sharigan. He also won't have the negative affects and will be able to use all mangekyou's, including eternal. His children are the same way, but they won't get the eternal.</p>

Note)</P><P>Chapter 4:
Visiting the Makai.</P><P>Naruto was
walking when suddenly a portal appeared below him. "Wha?"
he said before he fell into it & landed on a man's back. "OW!"
the man cried. "Sorry" Naruto said getting off the man.
Naruto looked to the man as he got up & was surprised at what he
saw. The man had long silver hair that goes to his back. Gold eyes. A
silver fox tail & silver fox ears.</P><P>He also was
wearing a toga of some kind. Naruto looked around to see plants that
looked dead, but was alive everywhere. The sky was red. "Where
am I?" he asked. "Makai, also known as the demon world"
said the fox man. Naruto looked at him with a raised eyebrow. He was
about to speak when another guy showed up.</P><P>He had black
spiky hair with a white starburst & crimson red eyes. He wore a
black cloak. He also had a white bandana covering his forehead. He
was smirking. "Seems like your attracting <I>human</I> trouble,
fox" the new guy said. "Shut it Pyro Pixie!" said the
fox.</P><P>Naruto just
sweatdropped. <I>'These guys are demons?'</I> Naruto thought. :Yes we
are: said a voice in his mind which he recognized as the guy's who
just showed up. <I>'What the fuck?! Get out of my mind!'</I> Naruto
mentally screamed. The guy just smirked. <I>"You really should
listen to him" </I>came a voice.</P><P>Everyone heard
it, but only Naruto and the fox man recognized it. "Kidara?"
the fox asked. Soon in a cloak of red chakra stood the girl in
question. She was in her human form. She had long red hair that goes
to her waist, gold eyes. She wore a fishnet bodysuit with a black
skirt. She also wore red trenchcoat. She wore black shinobi sandals,
& black fingerless gloves.</P><P>Naruto looked at
her. "How are you out of the seal?" he asked. "By
transporting you here, weakened the seal enough for me to temporary
leave but I need to stay near you, Naruto-kun" she said. Naruto
nodded then looked back to see the other two looking at him with
raised eyebrows. "What?" he asked. "Nothing" the
fox said. "So who are you guys? I'm Naruto Namikaze" Naruto
said. "Kidara" Kidara said. "Youko Kurama" said
the fox man. "Hiei Jaganashi" said the other guy.</P><P>Naruto nodded.
"Oh and Naruto?" Kidara said. "Yea, Kidara-chan?"
Naruto asked. Kidara blushed while Youko & Hiei smirked. "Youko's
my older brother" she said. Naruto stared at her then turned to
him who nodded saying it was true. Naruto fainted. They all laughed
and carried him to Youko's 's place. Youko carried him on his back.
They came upon the house & Youko walked in. Everyone stared at
him. Youko walked to his room & placed Naruto on his bed.</P><P>*6 hours later*</P><P>Naruto came out.
Everyone looked to him. "I feel like I have been hit by Zabuza's
blade in the face" he said. Kidara giggled. Naruto looked around
to see some new people. "I'm Naruto Namikaze" Naruto
introduced himself, seeing as Kidara already did. "Yusuke
Urameshi." came from a punkish teen. "Yukina Jaganashi"
came from a beautiful girl with ice blue hair & crimson eyes.
"Jin" came the reply of the wind demon.</P><P>"Touya"
came from the ice demon. "Chu" was the reply of the drunk
demon. "Rinku" came the child demon's reply. "Suzuka"
came the reply from the blond demon. "Shishiwakamaru" came
the reply from the blue haired demon. "Koenma" said the
Prince of the Spirit World. (He's in his teenage form.) "Botan"
came the reply of the kimono wearing grim reaper. Naruto nodded.</P><P>*A month later*</P><P>Naruto had been
training with them. He has mastered all the elements & got the
dragon of the darkness flame. His right arm now wrapped in bandages.
He went with Yusuke to the ningekai. "Hey Yusuke?" Naruto
called. "Yea?" Yusuke said. "Where are we going?"
Naruto asked. "To see a old teacher of mine, then to see my mom,
then my school" Yusuke said. "Oh. Okay" Naruto said as
they walked up a temple. Yukina greeted them. "Hello Yusuke,
Naruto-kun" she said. "Hey" Yusuke said. "Hello,
Yukina-chan" Naruto said as he & Yusuke walked in.</P><P>Inside was a old
woman. She looked up. "Oh great. The dimwit is here" she
said. Yukina giggled & Naruto laughed. "Yea, Yea. So
grandma, I would like to introduce you to Naruto Namikaze. Naruto
this is my former teacher Genkai" Yusuke said. Naruto bowed.
"Nice to meet you Genkai-sama" he said. Genkai nodded. 
They talked until Yusuke & Naruto decided to leave.</P><P>Yusuke &
Naruto were walking when they came upon a apartment. They walked in
to see Atsuko watching tv. "Wow. For once your not drunk"
Yusuke said. She looked at him. "YUSUKE!!!!!!" Atsuko said
hugging him. Yusuke twitched & Naruto snickered. "Who's
this?" she asked about Naruto. "My name is Naruto Namikaze
ma'am" he said. She smiled & got to know him a bit more.</P><P>Yusuke then
dragged him to his school. They walked straight to the class room.
The principal was giving a lecture. Kuwabara & Kayko were
listenening. "Wow. You actually not boring them today?"
Yusuke said. The class turned to him. "YUSUKE!" "URAMESHI!"
came from Yusuke & Kuwabara. The principal nodded.</P><P>Yusuke dragged
Naruto over to Kayko & Kuwabara. "This is my childhood
friend Kayko Yukimura" Yusuke said pointing to the girl. Kayko
nodded. Naruto smiled. "And this big oaf is Kazuma Kuwabara my
friend/rival. I call him Kuwabaka" Yusuke said pointing to said
oaf who glared at him. Naruto nodded. "I am Naruto Namikaze"
Naruto said.</P><P>*A month later*</P><P>Naruto had said
goodbye to everyone, including Kidara who is now free & staying
with her brother. Naruto got everyone's phone numbers. He then left
through a portal.</P>

Visiting the Sengoku Jidai</P><P>As he looked
around he noticed he was in a village, but no technology. He shrugged
and left. He was walking when he heard a scream. He ran to see a
group attacking a giant scorpion. There was a school girl, a tajiya,
a houshi, a kitsune kit, a nekomata, & a inu-hanyou.</P><P>He caught the
school girl just as she fell. "Thanks!" she said. "No
problem" he said. Then he told everyone to back away. They all
did, even thought the guy with silver hair grumbled while doing it.
"Fuuton: Daitoppa!" Naruto called out. The scorpion died.</P><P>"Thanks!"
came the voice of the tajiya. Naruto nodded. "No problem. Name's
Naruto Namikaze" he said. They nodded. "Kagome Higurashi"
said the school girl. "Sango" said the taijya. "Miroku"
said the houshi. "Shippo" said the kitsune kit. "Feh,
Inuyasha" said the Inu Hanyou. "This is Kirara" Sango
said pointing to the nekomata. Naruto nodded.</P><P>*A week later*</P><P>As they were
traveling a tornado came upon them. A wolf demon came out of the
tornado. "Yo!" the wolf demon said. "What do ya want
ya mangy wolf?" Inuyasha growled out. "I was just stopping
by because I smelled a new scent" the wolf said as he turned to
Naruto. "I'm Kouga. Leader of the Eastern Wolf Demon Tribe"
the wolf said. "My name is Naruto Namikaze" Naruto said.</P><P>Just then 3
other wolf demons shown up. There were two guys and a girl. One of
the guys had a mohawk & the other had gray hair with a bit of
black. Both guys had brown fur like Kouga, but the girl had white
fur. The girl had orange hair in pigtails, green eyes, & a purple
flower in her hair. "Kouga, why did ya leave us?" asked the
wolf with the mohawk. "Yea, Kouga?" said the other one.</P><P>The girl just
glared at him. "I picked up a new scent with mutt-face &
wanted to check it out" Kouga said. The three wolf demons then
turned to Naruto, who was now standing in front of Kagome. "I'm
Ginta" said the gray-haired wolf. "The name's Hakkaku"
said the mohawk wolf. "I am Ayame" said the female. "My
name is Naruto Namikaze" Naruto said. The three nodded as they
joined the group as did Kouga.</P><P>As the group
were walking a woman with straight black hair and brown eyes wearing
a miko garb came out. "Inuyasha? Who is this?" she asked
pointing to Naruto. "His name is Naruto Namikaze, Kikyo"
Kagome told her. Kikyo nodded. She then ended up traveling with them
while having her hate purified by Kagome. They soon came upon a group
of demonic children. All were familiar to the Inutachi. (Inuyasha,
Kagome, Miroku, Sango, Shippo, & Kirara)</P><P>The first was a
youkai with black hair in twin buns. She had red eyes. She was a
thunder demon. The rest were hanyou. The first hanyou had lavendar
hair & purple eyes. She was a bat hanyou. Another hanyou had blue
hair tied in a ponytail & gold eyes.</P><P>The little girl
had navy hair & blue eyes. The other girl had green hair &
green eyes. Then there were 3 boys. 2 boys looked like twins. One
with orange hair with green roots and orange eyes, the other with
green hair with orange roots and orange eyes. The little one had
silver hair and ember eyes.</P><P>"Hey guys!"
Kagome said running up to them. The kids looked up. "This is
Naruto Namikaze" Kagome said pointing to him. Naruto nodded.
"This is Souten" poining to the thunder demon. "Shiori"
pointing to the bat hanyou.</P><P>"Asagi"
pointing to the girl with blue hair. "Ai" pointing to the
little girl with navy hair. "Moegi" pointing to the other
girl. "Shion" pointing to the silver hair boy. "Roku"
pointing to the twin with green hair & orange roots. "and
Dai" pointing to the twin with orange hair & green roots.
The kids nodded.</P><P>*2 Weeks later*</P><P>The gang were
all traveling. They had said goodbye to the kids. Suddenly a youkai
with long silver hair, gold eyes, a blue crescent moon on his
forehead, 2 magenta stripes on each cheek appeared right in front of 
Naruto making him stop. He was wearing white & had two swords. He
was a inu youkai.</P><P>A little girl &
a toad youkai walked out. Behind them was a two headed dragon. The
girl ran up to Naruto. "Hi! Rin is Rin" she said. Naruto
smiled while his eyes showed amusement. "Hello Rin, I'm Naruto
Namikaze" he said. Rin nodded. "That's Master Jaken"
she said pointing to the toad youkai.</P><P>"Ah-Un"
she said pointing to the dragon. "and this is Lord Sesshomaru"
she said hugging the inu youkai's pant leg. "Hm...nice to meet
you" Naruto said. Sesshomaru studied him. He circled him then
smirked. "It seems this human is far better then you half breed"
Sesshomaru said to Inuyasha who glared at him. Sesshomaru then told
them they were going to be traveling with them. "Ah! Hell No!"
Inuyasha said.</P><P>Kagome sat him.
"He can join us!" she yelled. "AND I SAID FUCK NO!"
said Inuyasha before he collapsed from being hit in the head by
Naruto. "Hold your tongue" Naruto said. Kagome smiled at
him. Sesshomaru nodded to him.</P><P>*A Week later*</P><P>Naruto &
Kagome were in her era visiting. Naruto had just meet Kaede last
week. "Mom, I'm home! I brought a friend too!" Kagome
called out. Naruto introduced himself to Kagome's family who
introduced themselves. Souta was so surprised and happy to meet a
shinobi. The next day Naruto & Kagome went shopping for supplies.</P><P>While there
Naruto bought a Laptop with wireless internet & a cell phone. The
cell phone was black with a golden ten-tailed fox on it. Same as the
laptop. He also bought a black laptop with a red spiral surrounded in
blue flames. Naruto also tried Pizza & other foods. He bought
some clothes while he was at it. He even bought a laptop with
wireless internet & cellphones for his friends in the sengoku
jidai. He also bought 2 game systems of every kind and 2 of every
game. He even bought 2 plasma tv's & a sterio.</P><P>While they were
walking back to the shrine they meet up with Kagome's friends Eri,
Ayumi, & Yuka. Naruto also meet Hojo. When Hojo asked Kagome out,
Naruto told him that Kagome didn't like him like that.</P><P>*A month later*</P><P>The gang were
walking. Naruto had taught Kagome, Shippo, Rin, Sango, Miroku, Kikyo,
Ginta, Hakkaku, Ayame, & Kouga some jutsus. He also taught
everyone the tree climbing & water walking exercise. Naruto had
got a katana from Totosai called Arashi's Tempest.</P><P>He used one of
Kidara's fangs. Arashi's Tempest can turn into any weapon it clashes
with & gains their abilities. It has already clashed with
Tetsaiga, Tensaiga, Tokijin, Miroku's staff, Abi's trident, Kagome's
bow, & Sango's Hiraikotse.</P><P>They were
ambushed by Naraku. "kukukuku. What's this? New members? hmm...I
never seen you before, boy. What's your name?" Naraku asked
Naruto while Kagura, Kanna, Kohaku, & Hakudoushi faught the
others. "It's Naruto Namikaze" Naruto said. The battle then
started.</P><P>They faught for
a while. "Kaze no Kizu!" Inuyasha yelled. "Fuujin no
Mai" Kagura countered. Miroku tried his kazanna sucking in all
the demons. (Naruto got rid of the sumiyosho). Sango threw her
Hiraikotse at Hakudoushi killing him. Shippo & Rin knocked Kohaku
out.</P><P>Kagome destroyed
Kanna's mirror with her arrow. Sesshomaru, Kouga, Kikyo, & Ayame
faught Naraku's demons as well. Ginta & Hakkaku stayed beside
Kirara. Everyone then faught Naraku. The battle lasted for several
hours before they combined their attacks. (Kagura & Kanna are
unconcious).</P><P>"BAKURYUUHA!"
Inuyasha yelled.</P><P>"DRAGON
STRIKE!" Sesshomaru yelled</P><P>"SUITON:
SEIBUN HOUFUTSU NO JUTSU!" Kouga yelled</P><P>"GATSUUGA!"
Ginta & Hakkaku yelled</P><P>"KATON:
RYUKA NO JUTSU!" yelled Shippo</P><P>"SUITON:
KAIHOUDAN NO JUTSU!" yelled Kagome</P><P>"HANA
NINPOU, HYAKKA SEIHOU!" Rin yelled</P><P>"SUITON:
DAIBAKURA NO JUTSU!" Kikyo yelled</P><P>"HANA
NINPOU, HYAKKA RYOURAN!" Ayame yelled</P><P>"BUSHIN
BAKUHA!" Naruto yelled.</P><P>The attacks all
collided killing Naraku. Naruto hands the Shikon to Kagome.</P><P>*A month later*</P><P>Arashi's Tempest
turned out to be elemental resistant & could turn into a
kusari-gama, staff, scythe, zanpakuto, & zanbato. It has a pure
silver blade, black hilt with all kinds of gems; ruby, sapphire,
emerald, & amethyst. He had added Kagome's cell & home phone
to his cell as well as everyone else's. He left after saying
good-bye, falling into a portal. (He also added the people he meet
from the Yuyu Hakusho world's numbers)</P><P>-</P><P>Fuiton:

Visit to Midgar</P><P>Naruto was
walking around. He was in a place called Midgar. He walked to the 7th
Heaven. When he walked in he saw a group sitting around. He walked up
to the bar. "Hello miss" he said. "Hello" the
bartender said. "My name is Naruto Namikaze. Can you tell me who
you guys are?" he asked.</P><P>"Tifa
Lockhart" said the bartender. "Cloud Strife" said the
guy sitting next to him. "Barret Wallace" said a guy
sitting by the wall on the opposite side. "Yuffie Kisaragi"
said the girl sitting in a chair backwards. "Cid Highwind"
said the guy at the other end of the bar. "Vincent Valentine"
said the guy leaning on the wall.</P><P>"Cait Sith"
said the cat-creature. "Nanaki or as most call me Red Xiii"
said the wolf-like creature. Naruto nodded. "Uh...I'll just call
you Nanaki" he said. Nanaki nodded. (I always did like Nanaki
over Red Xiii). "I'm Aerith Gainsborough" said the girl
with the braid sitting on his other side. (Aerith did not die)</P><P>"Do you
think I could join you guys?" Naruto asked. "Sure"
Cloud said. They then headed out on a mission. They traveled for a
while when Avalanche heard a familair voice. "Well, Well. If it
isn't Strife and his little gang." Everyone looked up to see
five people.</P><P>Everyone, except
Naruto groaned. There were four guys and a girl. One guy had red hair
and red marks under his eyes. He was the one who spoke. Beside him
was a bald guy wearing shades. There was also a guy with black hair.
The girl was blonde. They all wore business suits. The last guy also
was blonde, but he wore a white coat. "Oh? Looks like you guys
got a new member" said the blonde.</P><P>They looked to
Naruto who had a raised eyebrow. "I'm Rufus Shinra" said
the blonde. "Reno" said the red head. "Rude" said
the guy with shades. "Tseng" said the other guy. "Elena"
said the female. "My name is Naruto Namikaze" Naruto said.
They nodded.</P><P>Reno smirked.
"You shouldn't hang with Strife and his gang. Especially those
worthless females!" Reno ranted. He continued to rant as the
girls got mad. The guys were especially mad, but the most surprising
was Naruto. He actually punched Reno. "What the fuck?!"
Reno shouted. "Don't insult my friends. Never insult my precious
people. Or you'll end up dead" Naruto said glaring.</P><P>Reno shivered
and backed up. "Can you kill a person?" Tseng asked. Naruto
smirked. "I am a trained shinobi" Naruto said making
everyone gasp. Yuffie got hearts in her eyes. They then faught. Cloud
& Vincent faught Rufus, Cid & Barret faught Tseng, Tifa &
Aeris faught Elena, Nanaki & Sith faught Rude, and Naruto &
Yuffie faught Reno. Rufus & the turks fled. Then everyone
continued to do the mission until it was complete.</P><P>*2 weeks later*</P><P>Avalanche was
currently resting when the door opened. Five people walked in. All
familiar to everyone, except Naruto putting them on edge. There were
four guys and one woman. One guy had shoulder-length hair and a
sword. Another guy had long hair that went to his back. He used guns
and was kinda girly. The other guy had short spiky hair and used
gauntlets. He seemed like a crybaby. They all wore skin tight black
suits.</P><P>The last guy had
very long hair. He used a very long sword. His outfit was black and
it had armor. He had one black wing. All had silver hair and green
eyes. The woman was beautiful. She had long translucent silver hair.
Her skin was blue. Her eyes is what attracted Naruto's attention. Her
right eye was red while her left was green. "What's this? A new
member?" said the guy with the wing.</P><P>Cloud clenched
his teeth. "Why are you guys here?" he asked. "We were
in the neighborhood so we thought we stop by" said the guy with
shoulder-length hair. "Who are you guys anyway?" asked
Naruto. "Right, forgive me. I'm known as Sephiroth. The
one-winged angel" said the guy with the wing smirking.</P><P>"I'm Kadaj"
said the guy with shoulder-length hair. "I am Yazoo" said
the girly guy. "Name's Loz" said the crybaby. "My name
is Jenova" said the woman. "Nice to meet you. My name is
Naruto Namikaze" Naruto said. Jenova and the boys nodded. Naruto
went out to spar with Sephiroth like he does with anyone when bored.</P><P>*A week later*</P><P>Avalanche were
resting in the base. Sephiroth, his remnants, Jenova, Rufus, &
the turks were currently visiting. Naruto had just kicked Reno's ass
again for insulting the girls then he used a lightning jutsu to
electocute him making everyone laugh because Reno's hair was standing
on end. Right now they are just relaxing when the door opened and
three girls walked in. Everyone, except Naruto were shocked. (Though
Sephiroth & Jenova didn't show it. The remnants were wide-eyed.)</P><P>The first girl
looked like a younger female version of Cloud. She had blond hair
that went to her back that was in a braid. Sky blue eyes that held
innocene. She wore a black tanktop, black skirt with ridges on the
bottom, black combat boots & a zanbato.</P><P>Another girl
looked exactly like Vincent with a outfit slightly different. She
wore a red shirt, black pants, black cape, & red fingerless
gloves. Her black hair was held by a red bandana & her eyes
shined crimson. She had silver shoes like Vincents & a silver
gauntlet (arm thing) like him too. (She's immortal too).</P><P>The last girl
wore a blue tanktop, black pants, and black shoes. Her red hair
pulled back in a ponytail & her green eyes held mischief. She had
those red marks like Reno under her eyes as well, in fact she looked
like a female Reno.</P><P>"Who are
you?" asked Naruto. "Star Strife. I'm Cloud's younger
sister" said the blond. "Rena. I'm Reno's twin" said
Reno's look-a-like. "I'm Vinslet Valentine. Vincent's twin"
said the female Vincent. "Who are you handsome?" Rena asked
Naruto. "Naruto Namikaze" he said. The girls nodded. Naruto
got to know them a bit more.</P><P>*a month later*</P><P>Naruto had meet
everyone and learned their attacks. Naruto was quite happy. He got
Arashi's Tempest to take the form of Sephiroth's Masamune. He soon
left after getting their phone numbers, he put their numbers on his
phone. He then disappeared in a portal. (He can turn his sword into
Cloud's sword, Kadaj's sword, Aeris's staff, and Cid's weapon).</P><P>-</P><P>By the way
Sephiroth & the remnants learned their lesson after getting their
ass kicked by Jenova who is a good guy so they are good guys now.
Maybe Semi-evil. Sephiroth and Naruto are sparing partners/almost
brother like. Naruto just kicks Reno's ass when ever he insults
someone for fun (unless he dislikes, hates, or has fun
mocking/teasing/making fun of them himself)</P>

Visit to Spira</P><P>Naruto was
walking around. He was currently in the thunder plains. As Naruto was
walking he heard a scream, the next he knew he was on the ground with
a beautiful blond girl on top of him clinging to him shaking.</P><P>Just then
another thunderbolt hit harder, making the girl cling harder. This
was the site that a group walked upon. There was a guy with orange
hair standing next to a calm black-haired woman. On the woman's other
side stood a man with black hair & he wore shades.</P><P>There was a
woman with short brown hair holding a staff. On her right was a blond
man. On her left was a blue lion-like creature. "Is she
alright?" asked the brown-haired girl softly. Naruto looked at
the blond girl. "I think so. My name is Naruto" he said.
"I'm Yuna the high summoner & these are my guardians"
said the brown-haired girl. Naruto nodded.</P><P>The blond man
nodded at him. "I'm Tidus" he said. Naruto nodded. "The
blue guy then spoke up. "Kimihari Ronso" was his short
reply. Naruto nodded. "My name is Lulu" said the
black-haired woman. Naruto nodded again. "Name's Wakka, ya!"
said the orange haired man. "I'm known as Auron" was the
guy in shades answer. Naruto just nodded. "My name is Rikku"
said the blond clinging to him.</P><P>Naruto smiled
then rubbed her back. "You okay now, Rikku?" he asked.
Rikku nodded. "So, Yuna. You said you were a high summoner? What
do you do, exactly?" he asked. Everyone stared at him in
confusion, except Auron. "What do you mean? Were you close to
Sin?" she asked. Naruto looked confused. "Who's sin?"
he asked.</P><P>"Sin is our
punishment. We are protecting Yuna to defeat Sin" Lulu said.
Naruto raised an eyebrow. "He kinda looks like a gaint whale"
Tidus said. Naruto chuckled. "No, I haven't been near sin. I'm
not even from this world, dimension whatever" he said surprising
them. "I thought so" said Auron. Naruto had joined them as
a guardian for Yuna.</P><P>*A week later*</P><P>Naruto had told
everyone he was a shinobi. He taught them some justus. Lulu got them
right away. He also taught everyone the tree climbing and water
walking exercise. Naruto had learned blitzball thanks to Wakka and
Tidus. He also learned Al Bhed thanks to Rikku. They found out that
he could summon as well so Yuna worked with him on that. He can
summon Valefor, Shiva, & Ifrit so far. He got Wakka not to hate
the al bhed, though no one knows how.</P><P>They were
currently walking when a man familiar to them showed up. "What
do you want?" Tidus asked rudely. The guy just raised a eyebrow
to him. "Yuna, it is time for you to marry me" said the
guy. Yuna hid behind Naruto who the guy just now seen. "Looks
like she doesn't want to" Naruto said. "Who are you?"
the guy asked rudely. "Shouldn't you introduce yourself before
asking another there name?" Naruto said. "hmph! I am
Seymour" the guy said. "Naruto" Naruto replied.</P><P>Just then a
monster attacked. Naruto summoned valefor surprising Seymour. "You
can summon?" Seymour asked while paling which everyone noticed
though only Auron knew why. "hnkao" Naruto said in al bhed
to annoy Seymour which worked making everyone laugh. (I don't know Al
Bhed really. So I'm just going to type something random when he or
someone else speaks it. Then i'll put these (as translations) By the
way he said yes)</P><P>Seymour's
eyebrow twitched. Naruto smirked. Then turned to Rikku and started to
talk to her.</P><P>Nar: kyama hith
eiso masik? (Is this guy really strong?)</P><P>Rik: na...mein
uyam (um...some what)</P><P>Nar: -sweatdrop-
Oui meik eyu lithe oui? (You don't know do you?)</P><P>Rik: -scratches
head in a sheepish manner- giua, nejo meiu (sorry, but no)</P><P>They looked to
see everyone staring at them. Only Yuna & Auron understood them.
Auron was sweatdropping while Yuna giggled. "What?" Naruto
and Rikku asked in unison making everyone sweatdrop, Auron stare, and
Yuna giggle harder. Seymour's eyebrow twitched even harder. Naruto
smirked. "Iuo feau mysi pei" he said. (Your blood vessal is
going to pop if you keep doing that)</P><P>Yuna giggled
even more, Rikku laughed, Auron shook his head, Seymour's eyebrow
twitched, and everyone else sweatdropped.. Seymour left and Naruto
laughed as well. "What did you say to him that last time?"
Tidus asked. "That his blood vessal was going to pop if his
eyebrow kept twitching" Naruto said cheerfully making Tidus and
Wakka laugh. Lulu sigh. Kimahri just been himself. They then
continued on there way.</P><P>*A week later*</P><P>Naruto had
spared with everyone. He can now turn Arashi's Tempest (or AT for
short) into Yuna's staff, Tidus's sword, Auron's sword, and more. He
taught them some more jutsus. He helped Rikku get over her fear. They
are currently riding Chocobo's across the plain when a chocobo eater
attacked Naruto and his chocobo. Naruto cut it in half by turning AT
into the Masamune.</P><P>*A month later*</P><P>They were
currently fighting Sin. Yuna kept summoning everyone, except the
final aeon. Everyone kept attacking. Just as Yuna was about to summon
the final aeon she saw it pass her. She looked behind her to see
Naruto who just summoned it. The aeon and Sin faught, but the aeon
overpowered it. They saw Jecht, Tidus's dad who said good-bye.</P><P>They all turned
to see Naruto, thinking he died (except Auron) only to their surprise
to see he's alright. "What?" Naruto asked. (By the way
Tidus found out about the dying from summoning the final aeon before
Naruto joined up.) "You should of died, Naruto. Anyone who
summons it is suppossed to die" Tidus said. Naruto just stared
at him then they all turned to Auron who was chuckling. "That
would be true if Naruto wasn't the summoner from the prophecy"
Auron said confusing them.</P><P>Yuna gasped.
They turned to her. "The legendary summoner is Naruto?" she
asked. Auron nodded. Everyone stared at them. Yuna explained. "There
is a prophecy that states a legendary summoner will come from far
away. They will be able to stop Sin for good by summoning the final
aeon. They won't die from it however. Thus saving all of Spira.
That's why Seymour paled when he saw Naruto summon. Naruto doesn't
look like he's from here. His accent is totally different as is his
personality. Plus he never went through the trials. Seymour knew
this. He knew Naruto was the legendary summoner!" Yuna said.</P><P>They all stared
at her wide-eyed then turned to Naruto who was scratching his head.
"I had no idea of any of this" he said making them all
sweatdrop. They then separated since Tidus didn't have to sacrifice
himself. He was like a older brother to Yuna. Naruto said good-bye
then left through a portal again.</P>

Home</P><P>Naruto was
walking around in Forget-Me-Not Valley. Anyway he was walking around
when he bumped into someone. "Eh? Sorry" Naruto apologized.
"Your not from around here are you?" asked the guy he
bumped into. "No, I'm traveling until I can find a home. Why?"
Naruto asked. "You can stay at the farm. No one wants it. By the
way, my name is Takakura" said the man. "Naruto"
Naruto said.</P><P>Naruto then went
to look at the farm. He liked it and decided to stay. He named the
farm Fireleaf after his home village and country. He got a dog which
he named Fang. He named his cat Kyo. He then went around and
introduced himself. He stopped by the inn first. Four people were
outside. Two males and two females. One male and female had black
hair. The other female had red hair and the other male was blond.</P><P>Naruto walked up
to them. "Hello" he said. They turned to him. "My name
is Naruto. I run the farm" he said. They nodded. "Welcome
dear. I am Ruby and this is my husband Tim. We run the inn" said
the black haired female as she pointed to the black haired male. Tim
nodded. "I am their son, Rock" said the blond. "I am a
traveler staying at the inn. My name is Nami" said the red head.</P><P>Naruto nodded
then smiled as he went to introduce himself more. He introduced
himself to Dr. Hardy next. Then Grant and Kate. Then Wally, Chris,
and Hugh. Then he meet Griffin and Muffy. He then went up to the
manor and meet Sebastian, Romana, and Lumina. Before he left he heard
a girl's voice and followed it where he meet the Witch Princess.</P><P>As he was
leaving he went to the tower where he meet Kassey and Patrick. Then
he meet Cody. After that he meet Daryl and Leia. Then he meet
Gustafa. Then he crossed the bridge where he meet Vesta, Marlin, and
Celia. He then went to the waterfall where he meet Carter and Flora.
Then Galen and Nina. As he headed home he meet Murrey. The next
morning he meet the Harvest Goddess.</P><P>He then took a
walk where he meet Van and Thomas, the mayor of mineral town. He meet
Trent, Cliff, Rick, and Gray later. Then he meet Ann, Elli, Popuri,
Karen, and Mary. At night he meet the female thief, Skye. (Yes Skye
is female in my story.) Skye wouldn't quit flirting with him, but
left before she was caught. He meet the bachelors and bachelorettes
from Mineral Town because they were visiting. Later that week he meet
Keria.</P><P>He bought 100 of
each kind of seed from Vesta. He became best friends with Nami,
Gustafa, and Skye. He later got a horse which he named Kumori. In
summer he meet Kai and Gotz. He asked Gotz to upgrade his house to
the final level. He bought a barn & chicken coop. He bought a cow
named Bessie, a sheep named Raul, a chicken named Chika, a rooster
named Ruise, and a duck named Ela. During winter he meet MukuMuku.</P><P>In the second
year he meet Barney and Mimi. He was very happy. He went to mineral
town and bought the farm as well as the vacation houses. He trains
everyday. He has every tool and animal as well as item. He doesn't
use the tools though. He gave Nami lots of money so she wouldn't have
to leave. He became the richest person in the world. He bought tons
of clothes. He has all buildings. His farm is very good. Sometimes
Skye stays at his place.</P><P>In the 3rd year
he got the bear Da-chan. A chihuaha from Carter which he calls
Chihua. Kidara had showed up once and turned him into a youkai. He's
the new Juubi. He pretty much has a good life. Though he does miss
his friends. If anyone wants to learn the shinobi they can come to
him to learn. He put his black laptop on the desk & his cell
phone is always on him. He even has a phone in his room.</P><P>He did upgrade
the farm to make it a 3 story house. It has 50 bedrooms, not
including the master bedroom. He stays in the master bedroom. It also
has a kitchen, indoor hotspring, dojo, exercise area, pretty much
everything. Even a theatre. There's even a game room that has one of
the plasma's tv. The laptop with the spiral in flames is in here. The
lobby has a couch, 2 recliners, a table, and a regular tv. The dining
room has a large enough table to fit 75 people. There's a game
library in the game room, a movie library in the theatre, and a
regular library that actually has books of every kind. The master
bedroom has a mini kitchen, mini game room, a walk-in closet, a
beautiful bathroom (by the way there are about 30 bathrooms.) It
truly is cozy. He even has the refridgerator stocked in both kitchens
as well as the cabinets. There's a game library in the mini game room
as well as a flat screen tv. The other plasma is in his room along
with the other laptop and sterio. He was truly at peace. He sent a
letter to the hokage through a summon.</P><P>~Hokage's
office~</P><P>Sarutobi was
searching through papers, when he spotted a letter. He opened it and
read.</P><P><I><U>Dear
Jii-san, </U></I></P><P><I><U>How have
you been these last 3 years? I have finally settled down in a village
called Forget-Me-Not Valley. There are no shinobi here, though I will
sometimes teach it. Kidara has went to stay with her brother in
Makai. I meet many people & new friends. I live on a farm. You
should visit sometime. Kidara came by earlier this year & turned
me into a youkai. </U></I></P><P><I><U>I'm a
bijuu now. I'm the Juubi no Kitsune, the ten-tailed fox. I'm world
known as 'Kitsune Tenshi'. In my bijuu form I have ten-tails, in my
human form I only have 1. Now my friends call me 'Foxy' to every one
else in the village I'm 'Fox Boy'. I hope to see ya again! By the way
I know I have to have a harem, especially because of my Kekkai
Genkai. </U></I></P><P><I><U>From the
unpredictable shinobi,</U></I></P><P><I><U>Naruto
Uzumaki Namikaze, Konoha's Kitsune Tenshi.</U></I></P><P><I><U>p.s. Use
Kage Bushin for the paperwork.</U></I></P><P>Sarutobi was
dumbfounded. "WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?!?!" he yelled
then hit his head on the desk about twenty times. He smiled then used
the jutsu while reading Icha Icha. (Couldn't resist!) Meanwhile
somewhere else someone was thinking on paying a old friend a visit
during the chunin exams.</P>
