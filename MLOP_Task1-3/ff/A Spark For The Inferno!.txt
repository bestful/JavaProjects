He could tell by the smell.</p><p>He dusted the imaginary dust of himself and felt something urge him to follow the water.</p><p>As he was walking,he started hearing something but he wasn't sure what..This made him walk faster and faster.</p><p>Suddenly ,the sound became much clearer..It was crying..Someone was Crying..At this time he wasn't walking..He was running at full speed.</p><p>Then he reached a huuuge room in which there was a Jail with a kanji for seal on figured someone was inside this came closer and touched the bars and suddenly the light's turned on.</p><p>Who he saw inside,was probably,no scratch that,SHE was THE prettiest girl he had ever seen in his life. She could be described as the very epitome of Crimson Haired beaty. She had long red hair that filled half the jail . She has a chest that wasn't necessarily huge but she wasn't exactly flat chested either.(Don't expect a detailed report about how she looks..Naruto's only fice for gods sake!He doesn't have an idea of cup-sizes and it will stay that way,you perverts!).The only thing that marred her beauty was the fact her eyes were blood shot from crying..for who knows how long..After a few good minutes past with Naruto enjoying the scenery,he gathered all his courage and asked.</p><p>„Umm..Are you alright?"</p><p>„KYA!"The girl was scared speechless. Naruto ,on the other hand , couldn't help but scream *KAWAII* inside of his had another good five minutes of staring at each other,the girl spoke first this time.</p><p>„Why are you here?""</p><p>„I don't exactly know WHERE i am?"Naruto asked,confused.</p><p>„Were inside of your Mind!Idiot!"</p><p>„Inside of my Mind?You mean inside of my head or something?"He asked while rubbing the back of his head, dumbly.</p><p>„Something like that but never mind that for I want to know is how you got here?"</p><p>„I don't know!...Well..Now that I think about it…I was killed!"</p><p>„Yea,right..If you were dead then you wouldn't be HERE..and neither would I."</p><p>„What the heck is that supposed to mean?What are you?My girl self or something?"</p><p>The girl just stared at him for a moment,dumbfounded.A thought hit him then.</p><p>„You..You have no idea who or what you are,do you?"</p><p>Then the girl started crying again…</p><p>„Ah!Wai..I didn't mean anything bad by that ok?"</p><p>„N-N-no…It's..It's alright..It's true..I have no idea of how i got here,who I am or what I am.."</p><p>„Then how about WE make YOU into someone,somewhat?"</p><p>„What do you mean?"</p><p>Silence…</p><p>„Umm…How about we start by naming you?"</p><p>„…..Okay…any suggestions?"</p><p>„How about…Ak-Kurama."He blinked twice.</p><p>„Um what?I don't think Ak-Kurama is a name…"</p><p>„No well…I wanted to say Akiko.."</p><p>„But?"</p><p>„Something told me your name was Kurama…"</p><p>„I see….I mean…I have no idea what you're talking about..But I guess my name is Kurama then..I suppose its okay..since I am a fox."</p><p>„A fox?What're you tal-…"Naruto was about to ask her the obvious but then behind her he saw NINE long red tails and a duo of fox ears on her mentally slapped himself for not noticing.</p><p>But then a scary thought hit him.</p><p>„You..You..YOU'RE THE NINE TAILED FOX!"</p><p>„Obviously…"</p><p>Naruto was shell-shocked at the monotonous reply…But then he remembered her saying how she had no memories at all..</p><p>„You..You don't remember anything…Aw geez…I'll just tell you the story then."</p><p>„A STORY!YEEY I love stories!..wait..about what?"</p><p>„You."He said in a dangerously cold monotone.</p><p>The girl's face instantly paled.</p><p>He sighed..And then started to tell her of herself..Of the fox and the many lives it took and how the Yondaime supposedly killed the story the first question was obviously this.</p><p>„But…if he KILLED me..Then How come I'm still alive?"</p><p>Naruto thought long and hard about then it hit him.</p><p>„I heard something a while ago..what was it abut again..SEALING!Yeah..that..I think that the Yondaime didn't kill you but he sealed you into something..or somebody..or.."</p><p>„..you.."</p><p>„yeah.."</p><p>The duo just stared at each other…Hoping the other would start screaming first so the they could follow in without shame..Soon Naruto broke the staring contest.</p><p>„Meh..whatever.."</p><p>The girl was,yet again,dumbfounded.</p><p>„How can you just say *whatever* and forget about it!"</p><p>„Whaaat?If we worry about it too much were both going to become from what i've heard,that shortens your life."</p><p>„Alright,good point but still.."</p><p>„…Well..I don't hate him for sealing me in you..I now have one of the prettiest girl's i've ever seen ,living in my head and I can proudly say that she is no fantasy!"</p><p>Kurama blushed so hard it would make a tomato jealous. Naruto just smirked.</p><p>„Hey,it never came to me but I never introduced myself…My name is Naru-„He started but the girl cut him off.</p><p>„No need for that..I've seen what has been happening to you all your life..I know everything about you…..Naruto..-kun.."</p><p>Now it was Naruto's time to blush.</p><p>„Uhm well..That's good to know i guess..By the way, Kurama-chan,do you have any idea how do I get back to the real world?"</p><p>The girl shook her head in negative but soon after a light bulb pooped on her head.</p><p>„Maybe you just have to think of an exit?This is YOUR MIND after all."</p><p>„Hmm..Maybe you're right."</p><p>He then did just that and all of a sudden door reminded him of the door to his opened it and saw the ceiling of his apartment.</p><p>„Well this is certainly interesting…."</p><p>„Yes,quite so."</p><p>Naruto then looked like he was deep in was his mind as she said..That means he could probably change it as well..He didn't want his pretty friend living inside of a sewer.</p><p>He closed his eyes hard and thought of something benefiting Kurama and the fact she was a fox…A FOREST!Yeah that had to be it!He thought long and hard of what a forest should look felt the ground he was standing on shift and change beneath , he heard Kurama gasp quite loudly.</p><p>He opened his eyes only to see something stunning.</p><p>It was a with green,tress,flower fields,animals that looked alive,there was a soft breeze which actually made the trees leave's place was completely made out of imagination and solely for that reason it was more beautiful than anything he had ever seen There was also a huge waterfall that was falling from the sky..literally…Okay so the place had its own touch of supernatural in it..but hey it was made out of THOUGHT so that isn't all that surprising.</p><p>„It's..This is..Absolutely..Amazing.."She unconsciously reached a hand out as if to grasp something but recoiled after electricity struck her as she grabbed the end of her jail.</p><p>Naruto got a pained look on him after seeing this and without another word he started to focus on her jail.</p><p>He tried to find a solution to let her have as much freedom as possible but not break the seal because he had no idea of what that certain action might do..So after some thinking he finally found a solution..Kurama will forever hate him for it tho...</p><p>The Jail disappeared ,true ,true but a collar appeared on Kurama's neck..On the collar it said : Naruto's Pet…</p><p>„P-P-P-PERVERT!"She screamed only to get a perverted grin in turn.</p><p>„Consider this,rent."</p><p>„Tsk!...fine.."</p><p>„Aww,don't be so angry Ku-chan!That collar looks good on you by the way."</p><p>She was blushing quite madly right now.</p><p>Naruto was about to go back to reality but he was sure he wanted to come back for nothing then to tease the poor girl. He wanted to be able to talk to her while he wasn't here too.</p><p>As if called for,a microphone appeared on the girls collar which was the answer of his second wish he guesses but he go nothing of the first.</p><p>„Well,see you later,Kurama-chan!If you want to talk to me i suppose you can try using that microphone on your collar."He waved and stepped into the portal, disappearing completely.</p><p>The last thing the both of them thought before falling asleep was.<i>"Maybe this isn't as bad as I thought."</i></p><p>„<i><b>BACK TO THE CRUEL EVIL KNOWN AS REALITY!"</b></i>Naruto shouted!</p><p><i><b>(DON'T MIND ME IM A LINE BREAK)</b></i></p><p>Naruto woke up inside of his own apartment like the door inside his head showed. On his desk was a letter and a basket of flowers near his bed.</p><p>He tried to stand up but found himself unable to and fell face down to the floor. He could hear Kurama laughing pretty loudly in his head and then he remembered he could shut of their line of connection whenever he wanted to.</p><p>„<i>NOOO!PLEASE DON'T!"</i>screamed Kurama.</p><p>„Then stop laughing."</p><p>There was no answer but he could see her nod.</p><p>When he finally stabilized himself , he grabbed the letter of his said :</p><p>„<i>Naruto , how are you feeling?</i></p><p><i>This is your favorite old man speaking here,</i></p><p><i>Come see me when you're healed…I have something for you so come to my office as soon as you can okay?</i></p><p><i>And no, it's not a birthsday present..I know you hate has something to do with you becoming a ninja!Exciting, isn't it?</i></p><p><i>Well..As you can see..I'm not that good at writing letters..Ah screw it!</i></p><p><i>Naruto,get better soon ,okay?Please…I wish nothing more but for you to be happy..but I cant do this alone..Please promise me you will stop pranking villagers and this has nothing to do with my paperwork!</i></p><p><i>Love always ,Your Jiji."</i></p><p>Naruto both sweat dropped and tear dropped while reading the letter.</p><p>He got a good look in the mirror and saw that he was in his underwear…It was kind of embarrassing now since he has a girl living in his head…No rather…He now KNOWS he has a girl living in his head.</p><p>„<i>Touche."Kurama's voice echoed in his head.</i></p><p>„<i>Whatever…"</i></p><p>„Well I might as well change and go visit Jiji.."</p><p><i><b>(DON'T MIND ME IM A LINE BREAK)</b></i></p><p><i><b>The Hokage's Office (No shit sherlock?)</b></i></p><p>„Oya Jiji, you wanted to see me?"</p><p>„Naruto!Yes I did want to see you but first; are you alright?"</p><p>„Yeah,I'm just fi..Nah I'm better than ever actually."</p><p>„Oooh?And why might that be?"</p><p>„Because today I'm going to get some questions answered."</p><p>„Which questions?"</p><p>„I..met the Kyuubi."</p><p>The Hokage looked at him dumbfounded.</p><p>„It..it..did it hurt you?"</p><p>„First of all..It's a SHE..and no she didn't hurt me…Sit down Jiji i know I can trust you so let me tell you the full story."</p><p>„Thank you, Naruto."</p><p><i><b>(DON'T MIND ME IM A LINE BREAK)</b></i></p><p><i><b>God know's how many hours later…What time is it anyway?</b></i></p><p>„Well..That's quite a story…So she lost her memories..but she remembers being controlled by red eyes…"</p><p>„Well..I can see that right now…Kyuubi is basically a very pretty girl living in your head…And you actually have proof she exists…"</p><p>„Jealous much ,Jiji?"Smirked Naruto.</p><p>„What?Of course not!...I remember you wanting some questions answered an-„</p><p>„Who was my father and who was my mother?"</p><p>„I ..You have to promise me you wont go into the middle of the village and scream who your parents are."</p><p>„Hmm..So My dad really is the Yondaime.."</p><p>The Hokage , once again , found himself dumbfounded and O_Oing the little boy.</p><p>Naruto sighed…"It's not that hard to figure out..The Yondaime was known as a honorable man so I guessed if he sealed the kyuubi into someone it would be his own child…He wouldn't have the hearth to ask another for such a sacrifice…And I bet he probably wanted me to be a hero or something…Too bad the villagers don't agree with him then, no?"</p><p>„…It would seem that you are much smarter than you look , Naruto…"</p><p>„Yeah well now that I have a girl living in my head that can actually talk to me I'm only going to get smarter.."</p><p>„True true."</p><p>„And..what about my mom?"</p><p>„She was Kushina Uzumaki , also known as the Red Death of Konoha and the only ninja capable of giving your father a run for his money.
