to surrender and come with us to Knonha for your URK!" the
hunter-nin dropped dead with a clean slice through the neck delivered
by a 6 foot man wearing a white trench coat with crimson flames along
the bottom with the Kanji for 'Kyuubi' on the back, standard
shinobi pants and a plain white t-shirt. His hair was blond and spiky
atop his head although as his ponytail went down his hair was
straighter said ponytail reached in between his shoulder blades. His
weapon was a 4-foot long katana with a half foot hilt which was
wrapped in crimson leather and ended in a small but brilliant ruby.
The blade itself was blood red and had an image of a nine-tailed fox
running up the blade on both sides and seemed to absorb the blood
that got on it. After the man finished getting rid of the body he
went back to polishing his blade witch is why he stopped at this
river in the first place.*sigh*'they just get weaker and weaker
don't they Kyu-chan?' thought Naruto</P><P>In
his mind his demon smiled and said 'you're just getting stronger
Naruto-kun'</P><P>'Naruto-<I>kun</I>?
When did that happen?' asked Naruto with a smirk although he was
secretly thrilled. The reason for this is that some point Naruto fell
in love with Kyuubi and he really hoped that she felt the same.</P><P>'oh
shut up you' she said looking away with a blush. Now the reason for
the blush was because sometime around the same time as Naruto she
fell in love with him but being the proud demon she was she simply
couldn't tell him and was convinced he didn't feel the same way
about her and because of this she simply resigned herself to be
lonely and sad without him.(clichéd I know but hey it works)</P><P>With a smile at her
response he got up and sheathed his blade and set of for the next
town witch was a few days away while humming a tune.</P><P>That
night…</P><P>Naruto
was in the middle of some dream about ramen and other random things
like the nature of the universe and whatnot when he heard crying
coming form his mindscape curious he went to his mindscape and began
looking for the source of the crying sound. He was getting close to
Kyuubi's cage when he realized that the sound was familiar in a
way. With that thought in mind he sped up and found Kyuubi was the
one crying and was about to ask her what was wrong when she started
talking</P><P>'I
love Naruto-kun but I know he doesn't love me I mean what kind of
person loves a demon? I've been alone so long…' at this she
broke down crying again</P><P>At
that last comment Naruto rushed forward and despite the advice of
every seal master he had ever met went stragit in between the bars
and hugged Kyuubi. Kyuubi was in shock that he was hugging her and
then dread took over.</P><P>'N-Naruto
how much did you h-hear?' she asked dreading the answer</P><P>'I
heard everything Kyu-chan' Naruto responded still hugging her</P><P>'o-okay
t-then I-I'll just-muph!' Kyuubi couldn't continue because she
found herself kissing Naruto-and enjoying every second of it but as
soon as she started kissing back he broke the kiss and said 'I love
you Kyu-chan always will' while looking into her deep red eyes.
This time Kyuubi kissed Naruto for a few minutes and afterwards
snuggled into his chest while he wrapped his arms around her.</P><P>Neither of them knew how
long they stayed like this they only knew that they would always
remember it especially what happened next.</P><P>'CRACK'
came from the seal</P><P>They
both turned their heads slowly to look at the seal which had a crack
down the middle and looked back at each other.</P><P>'fuck'
they simultaneously thought before being engulfed in a bright white
light</P><P>A/N
OF IMPORTANCE</P><P>I
know sappy as hell right well don't worry lots of fighting next
chapter (yay violence) now some of you may be wondering what Kyuubi
looks like right? Well she is 5'11" has deep red eyes and dark
crimson hair that she just lets fall down to her waist. She also has
a perfect hourglass figure and her breasts are as big as Hinatas in
shippuden.</P><P>Next
is the fact that THIS WILL NOT BE A HAREM and buy all that is
everything <I><U><B>..YOAI.</B></U></I></P><P>Period.
Now for every body who thought there would be a lemon sorry but
couldn't do it wouldn't fit/flow right but that's what the next
chapter is for, no?</P><P>POLL:BLOODLINE</P><P>Superhuman-does
just what it sounds like he becomes super in every way ;-]</P><P>Doujutsu-which
one?</P><P>Original-tell
me what it does and how it looks</P><P>Fallen
Angel-when activated user gains black angel wings eyes turns black,
iris turns red, pupil is electric blue. All chakra has potency
increased also turns black, eyes have Sharingan an effect minus the
copying, wings allow supersonic flight without chakra creates a
visible 'maelstrom' effect due to chakra potency jump. When used
in conjunction with Kyuubi wings turn a deep crimson as does his
chakra. Bloodline abilities are also increased due Kyuubi's natural
chakra already being so potent. Bloodline used in conjunction with
Naruto's sword Kyuubi allows for devastating long range attacks.
Comes in 3 levels each increasing in power.</P><P>Obviously
I put a lot of effort into coming up with 'Fallen Angel' but it
is an awesome original bloodline. If you wish to use it you can but
credit me with coming up with it. So vote via Review AND AWAY WE
GO!!!</P><P>later</P>
