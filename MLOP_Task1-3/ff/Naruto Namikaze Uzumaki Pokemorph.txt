Dark-Magician-41. I'm changing it to a harem so sorry to all of you
NaruHina fans, but she will still be in the harem</P><P>Naruto Uzumaki was putting the
finishing touches on one of the many scrolls he brought to copy down
a few jutsu from the forbidden scroll he just stole along with a few
other scrolls. He knew that Mizuki was using him to get the said
scroll from the old man Hokage and decided to use this opportunity to
not only test a jutsu he was working on but also get true help with
controlling his chakra.</P><P>The Naruto here is not like the one we
have read about in the Manga. He is actually a lot smarter then he
look and acts. He had over heard a few Jounin talking about how the
best way to defeat at opponent was to have them underestimating them.
From that day forward his dobe mask had been worn. He even somewhat
fooled the Hokage with it.</P><P>"Now what else to copy." He said as
he finished copying seals/instructions and started looking the scroll
over again.</P><P>As he got near to the end he saw a
blood seal. He had read about many different types of seal when he
sneaked into the library since he could not go in the normal way
since the old hag of a librarian hated him. He read what was above
and around the seal.</P><P><I>Dear reader;</I></P><P><I>This seal is to hold the seal the
Uzumaki clan used to transform their members into a humanoid version
of the ancient and unfortunately extinct pokemon race. Before they
became the beast we know of today there were at least 493 of the
strange and magnificent animals. The only way to keep them alive so
to speak was for them to fuse with a special clan of humans that are
known today as the Uzumaki clan. While anyone can become a pokemorph
only the Uzumaki clan can truly harness the unlimited potential that
the ancient animals were know for. If you do decide to use these
seals be careful because you may not like what you've become or you
may lose control of your self.</I></P><P>Naruto was curious and decided to use
this seal but first he needed to get the scrolls he borrowed and
those used to copy some jutsu to his house. Remembering the first
jutsu, Kage Bushin, he looked over that part of the scroll for the
seal and formed it. Soon ten Naruto's appeared and he had them all
take the scrolls to his house is secret. Now that was taken care of,
he turned back to looking over the blood seal. Biting his thumb to
draw blood he smeared it over the seal and with a small bang a few
scrolls appeared where the seal was.</P><P>This surprised Naruto and guess his
real last name was Uzumaki; not just something he figured the old man
cooked up. Rolling up the big scroll he set it to the side before
opening the one of the smaller scroll. He hit the jackpot then and
there as he saw the seal to the pokemorph ability. While it stated
how the seal is made it also detailed that if anyone other then the
Uzumaki clan can not defeat their inner pokemon they would be in a
coma for a year and would not be able to do it again. If they were an
Uzumaki the pokemon would only look thru their hearts to see if they
were worthy.</P><P>Naruto began to really hope his last
name was Uzumaki and began to make the seal on the ground with an
extra large bottle of ink he had with him. It took an hour but he
finally finished the seal. He was just finishing the inner parts of
the seal standing in the middle where it was the only place a person
could stand and was just about to pump chakra into it when he heard
something in the bushes.</P><P>He looked and saw Iruka sensei yelling
at him, "NARUTO; WHAT IN THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOUR DOING?!?!"</P><P>Reverting back to his mask Naruto
stupidly shouted out, "I'm just doing what you told Mizuki to
tell me!!!" 'That's right, when you get caught; blaming someone
else is the way to go. And in this case it the right person.'</P><P>"Huh?" Iruka said intelligently,
"What did I tell him to tell you?"</P><P>"You said that if I learned one jutsu
from that scroll," He pointed to the forbidden scroll, "Then I
could become a Genin!!!"</P><P>"Why would Mizukiâ€¦" Just as he
was thinking out loud, he was nailed to the wall of the shed in that
clearing by kunai.</P><P>"What going on???" Naruto asked
before looking at where the kunai came from and saw Mizuki on a
branch with two huge shuriken on his back.</P><P>"Arigato Iruka. Without you I would
have never found him in time." Mizuki said before looking at the
blond, "Hand me the scroll Naruto and you will pass."</P><P>"DON'T NARUTO!!!" Iruka cried out
from the wall, "HE ONLY WANT'S THE SCROLL FOR HIMSELF!!!"</P><P>Mizuki scoffed before asking, "Do you
know why everyone hates you?"</P><P>"DON'T MIZUKI, THAT'S
FORBIDEN!!!" Iruka cried out as Naruto, who wondered what Mizuki
was talking about, asked hesitantly.</P><P>"W-why does everyone hate me?"</P><P>Ignoring the shouting Iruka he said,
"It's related to the law that deals with you."</P><P>"W-what law?"</P><P>"DON'T!!!" Iruka cried out hoping
to stop Mizuki.</P><P>"The law says that no one can tell
you that you are the reincarnation of the Kyuubi No Kitsune that
killed all those people when you attacked fourteen years ago!!!"</P><P>"NANI?!?!" Naruto shouted and
accidentally started pushing in chakra into the seal which began to
glow.</P><P>Soon it shot up into the air like a
gold beacon into the night. Iruka shouted out Naruto's name fearing
for his student's life.</P><p align='center'><B>Inside the seal</B></P><P>Naruto closed his eyes as the light
blinded his eyes soon as it dimmed a bit he looked and saw that he
was in a cave of some kind standing an ledge with water all around
it.</P><P>"Where am I?" He asked as he looked
around.</P><P>"'You are in the cerulean cave, or
a mental replica of it.'" He heard from somewhere and turned
around to see a strange creature behind him.</P><P>The creature looked like a human with a
few cat features. Its fur was grayish-purple with a purple underbelly
and long thick tail. Its legs were bowed a bit and his arms while
thin were pretty muscular if Naruto could guess. His upper chest
looked more like body armor then a regular chest including the
shoulders which Naruto guessed was extra bones. His head was like a
triangle or a baseball diamond with short crooked cat ears on top of
his head and deep purple eyes that seemed to look into your soul.</P><P>There was also, Naruto was a bit
hesitant at explaining this, tube or spine coming from the base of
his neck up to just above where the head and neck met. The creature
also had three digits on each of his hands and feet. While Naruto did
read a lot during the day he was able to sneak into the library and
"borrow" a couple of books, he did not know what manner of
creature this was.</P><P>"'I am not a creature as you would
put it.'" The thing said without moving his mouth making
Naruto's jaw drop, '"I am a Mewtwo, a genetically enhanced and
created Psychic Pokemon."'</P><P>(Talking with telepathy will be like
this "'word"')</P><P>After putting his jaw back on Naruto
asked, "So you're a pokemon?"</P><P>"Yes I am," Mewtwo said, "Do you
not know about us? You are an Uzumaki from your mother's side if I
am right."</P><P>"I don't know." Naruto said
sadly, "I never knew my family. Even thought Hokage-ojiisan says he
doesn't know who my parents are I think he knows but won't tell
me for my protection or something."</P><P>'"I see,"' Mewtwo said with a
bit of emotion, '"I believe I do know who your parents are but at
the moment we do not have a lot of time so I will give you a brief
lesson about being a pokemorph and your family on the Uzumaki side."</P><P>Clearing his throat he started, '"Over
two thousand years ago, my kind called pokemon, were abundant all
around the earth with a few animals that you have today. But an evil
organization called Team Rocket wanted to have the entire world's
pokemon for them selves. They created a virus that would force
pokemon to obey any team rocket member. Unfortunately they
accidentally released it into the world prematurely where it mutated
into a deadly virus that killed pokemon."</P><P>Naruto gasped as Mewtwo sadly
continued, '"The thirty four legendary pokemon, including myself
wanted to find a way to keep pokemon alive and begged a human named
Ash Ketchum to help. Unfortunately the only way that he could find to
save the pokemon race was to open a rift into another world where the
virus could not follow and sent us there."'</P><P>'"Over a hundred Years ago someone
found out about us we while we could not live in this world because
the barrier between our worlds to protect us from the now dead virus
was still around and kept us on the world we migrated to, he found a
way to fuse human and pokemon together, he was the first pokemorph
and the first Uzumaki to gain this ability."'</P><P>'"When human and pokemon fused
their minds connected and the pokemon became a sort of mental
companion giving the human its abilities and powers in exchange for
being aloud to bind with the human. Unfortunately there was a side
effect which caused two thirds of the ninja's chakra to be diverted
to the powers he held as a pokemorph."'</P><P>"What about my mother?" Naruto
asked and Mewtwo was going to answer but he tilted his head to the
side as if listening to something the boy could not hear.</P><P>'"I would love to tell you but
there is not much time left before your transformation is finished.
You do not have to worry about your chakra much because of the Kyuubi
giving you chakra levels of a Hokage which will not be at a Genin's
or Chunin's level. I will tell you more when you go to sleep later.
NOW GO!!!"</P><P>Before Naruto could say more he felt
himself being flung into the air and bright light blinding him.</P><p align='center'><B>Outside the seal</B></P><P>The two Chunin teachers kept their eyes
covered as they waited for the light show to calm down. As soon as it
did they looked and gasped at what they saw. In the middle of where
the seal was stood Naruto but changed, a lot. Naruto's body changed
to look like a cat a bit with long arms and legs, which were a bit
bowed, lean with the muscles now similar to steel cords. Actually his
body was very lean with light purple fun covering his entire body
with not a trace of blond anywhere.</P><P>From his stomach to under his legs was
dark purple with thick bullwhip like tail at the base of his spine
just above his ass also dark purple. His lost his regular human ear
and gained small crooked cat like ears instead with his face now
similar to a baseball diamond or a triangle. He also gained a tube
similar to the original Mewtwo's with the only thing not changed
was his bright blue eyes with oval pupils and three light whisker
marks.</P><P>His orange clothing was ripped apart
some with the bike shorts and his black shirt underneath it unharmed.
The shirt was tight enough to show the same body armor like chest
made form bone yet loose enough to not hinder Naruto in the least
bit. Naruto looked up and smirked a bit seeing his teachers look of
surprised on their faces.</P><P>"I WAS RIGHT!!!" Mizuki shouted
gleefully, "YOU ARE A MONSTER!!!"</P><P>He started laughing maniacally but was
cut off when Naruto spoke up.</P><P>"Mizuki no Baka. First you says that
I am the Kyuubi reincarnated, which is not true, and now you're
saying that I'm a monster. Make up your damn mind!!!"</P><P>The pissed Mizuki off. Grabbing one of
the huge shuriken on his back and threw it at Naruto. The pokemorph
just smirked before he raised hand towards the shuriken. Iruka
started to warn his student about the shuriken when both the boy and
the flying blade started glowing blue.</P><P>"<B>Confusion,</B>" Naruto said
simply as shuriken kept on spinning but stayed in midair.</P><P>With a simple flick of his wrist he
sent the shuriken back to its owner, just a bit faster then it had
left Mizuki's hand. The silver haired man barely dodged out of the
way before the shuriken embedded itself into the tree he was in.</P><P>"You missed!!!" Mizuki taunted
Naruto and was shut up when a fist mysteriously appeared in front of
him.</P><P>"<B>Teleport,</B>" He disappeared
like a mirage in the desert and reappeared behind the flying Mizuki
twisting around to allow his tail to slam into the faux teacher's
back.</P><P>He did this a few more times testing
him self to see what he could do. After a while he had to stop. While
he was not physically tired, mentally was a whole other story.</P><P>"<B>Disable,</B>" He said as the
man slowly got up and froze in mid movement as if the whole world
stopped.</P><P>Iruka was stunned shitless seeing his
supposedly dead last student kick a Chunin level ninja's ass and
didn't even look winded. He was shocked back to reality when Naruto
slowly yet delicately pulled out the kunai holding him to the shed
wall.</P><P>"Are you alright Iruka-sensei?"
Naruto asked in a slightly deeper voice.</P><P>"I guess," Iruka said hissing
slightly as his student laid him on the ground, "What happened to
you?"</P><P>"I guess you could say that I used an
advance Henge that literally changed my DNA into what you see before
you now." Naruto said stunning Iruka more.</P><P>"Who would you know this?"</P><P>Naruto smirked as he said, "I was not
as dumb as I made myself to look like, now I have at least IQ of
5,000, give or take a few points."</P><P>That almost put Iruka into a coma but
stopped when Naruto turned to look at Mizuki who was still frozen.</P><P>"We'll talk more later sensei.
Right now I need to take out the trash."</P><P>Naruto stood in front of his sensei and
snapped his fingers dispelling the technique and allowing Mizuki to
woozily stand up.</P><P>"For your crimes against Konoha,
you're getting a cod size beating. <B>Psychic!!!</B>" Naruto
started glowing again as a few trees surrounding the clearing.</P><P>With a great rip they tore out of the
ground and began hovering above Mizuki who started screaming like a
little girl. The Pokemorph began to pound Mizuki with the trees
leaving the poor (Bullshit) man into a bloody pulp. After he had his
fun Naruto let go of the tree and they fell to the ground, right on
Mizuki making a bigger mess.</P><P>"Well, that's that." Naruto said
dusting off his hands, he then heard Iuka groaning and his eyes went
wide, "IRUKA-SENSEI" He said and turned towards him.</P><P>Iruka slowly got to his feet and with a
chuckle waved off his worrying student, "I'm okay Naruto but I
have something for you."</P><P>Naruto tilted his head to the side
making him look cute with his cat like features.</P><P>"Close your eyes for a second."</P><P>Naruto mentally shrugged and did just
that. He felt Iruka's hand go around his neck with some kind of
cloth and tied it off. When Iruka pulled his hands back he asked
Naruto to open his eyes. The first thing he saw was that Iruka was
not wearing his hitai-ate and put two and two together.</P><P>"Congratulations!!! You pass!!!"</P><P>Naruto's eyes watered before he
jumped on the hurting man hugging with all his might.</P><P>"HEY WATCH IT I'M STILL HURTING!!!"</P><p align='center'><B>Two weeks later</B></P><P>Two weeks have passed since the new
Genin have passed their exam into the Shinobi World. A few of them
were talking adamantly as they tried to figure out who they were
going to be paired up with. All of Sasuke's fan girls were hoping
and praying that they would be paired up with the dark heart throb.
Only one girl out of all of them was sad.</P><P>Hinata Hyuuga was extremely sad since
she found out that Naruto did not pass the test yet again and she
will not be on his team ever. She tried to find him to comfort him in
some way but he was strangely absent. Before anyone knew it the door
at the front of the classroom opened up and Naruto in his new form
walked in, thou the kids did not know it.</P><P>He was wearing dark blue jean shorts
with a black short sleeved shirt and a vest like trench coat over the
entire thing. He also had armor on his fore arms and shins. He also
had custom made Shinobi sandals on his feet and his Hitai-ate around
his neck.</P><P>As soon as he was about to walk up the
stairs to a seat he heard a loud "KAWAIII!!!" and before he knew
it all the girls in the classroom glomped him rubbing his ears and
his tail.</P><P>"Gack!!!" Naruto cried out as he
was unknowingly to the girl slowly choking.</P><P>Iruka came into the room just in time
to see the kid he thought of as a son under a pile of girl with only
his head showing which was slowly turning blue. He quickly got them
of to allow the boy turned pokemorph to breath and made the girl
whine in sadness.</P><P>"Who's the freak?" Kiba said
after Naruto regained his breath.</P><P>Naruto turned to Iruka and smirked,
"Told you they would not figure it out."</P><P>The teacher sighed before saying, "I
guess I owe you ten bowls of ramen later Naruto."</P><P>"NARUTO!!!" Every one there shouted
in shock with Hinata fainting in happiness seeing her love passed.</P><P>"What happened?" Ino, the biggest
gossip in Konoha asked wondering how the short orange haired boy
changed into a cute human like animal.</P><P>Iruka and Naruto told a tale that
Sarutobi cooked up about how Mizuki switched the paper test for a
Chunin level test, gave Iruka flawed kunai to give to Naruto, and
used a seal to disrupt Naruto's chakra enough to make him fail the
bushin test. When they wanted proof that Naruto could use the bushin,
he successfully created one thanks both to his lower Chakra storage
and a few Chakra control exercises. He also told them how he
accidentally ground out about his parents and gained his new form.</P><P>Soon after they finished Naruto walked
up the stairs passing a seat next to Sakura shocking everyone and
sitting next to Hinata instead. The shy girl was shocked; not only
with Naruto's transformation but also how easily he passed Sakura
who was suppose to be his crush. Iruka was the only one not
surprised. He had gotten to know the real Naruto over the last two
weeks and learned than he thought Sakura as an older sister. An
annoying older sister, because of her crush on Sasuke but a sister
none the less.</P><P>After everyone settled down, Iruka
started his yearly speech on what his graduates will face, before
separating them into teams.</P><p align='center'><B>Next Chapter</B></P><P>Next chapter Naruto learns who his
teammates are and goes crazy over it.</P><P>Naruto: "WHY AM I PAIRED UP WITH THE
TEME?!?!"</P><P>After seeing her new teacher he goes to
his new home and gets the surprise of his life.</P><P>Hinata: "I LOVE YOU NARUTO!!!"</P><P>Will Naruto return Hinata's love or
will Hinata get her heart broken?</P><P>Naruto: "Hinataâ€¦"</P><P>FIND OUT NEXT TIME!!!"</P><P>Naruto and Iruka: "FRIEND OR FOE?!?!
or HINATA'S LOVE!!!"</P><P>Mewtwo: '"Don't break her heart
kid."'</P>

Naruto</B></P><P>After giving the speech on what they
would face, Iruka started assigning teams.</P><P>" Team 7 will hold the students
Sasuke Uchiha..." he started.</P><P><I>" Please don't let me be on the
team with the teme," </I>Naruto thought.</P><P><I>" Please let me be with
Sasuke-kun," </I>Sakura thought while blushing.</P><P>" Naruto Uzumaki..." he said,
but was cut off by a loud yell.</P><P>"WHY AM I PAIRED WITH THE
TEME?!?!" Naruto yelled.</P><P>" Be quiet Naruto," he said.</P><P>" BUT...BUT..." Naruto
muttered, but loud enough for everyone to hear.</P><P>" NARUTO SHUT UP!" he yelled
making Naruto be quiet on the snap.</P><P>" Now the last one is Sakura
Haruno," he said making all the girls (except Hinata) let out
angry moans.</P><P>" Now the other teams stay here
and wait for your jounin to show up," he said and left.</P><P>Naruto and the other teams sat there
for an hour waiting for their senseis, but for some reason they
didn't show up so they all decided to talk to each other while they
wait. Naruto was sitting there when all of a sudden a lot of girls
came up to him and started asking him if his ears and tail are real,
but he just decided to ignore them until they started yelling at him
in his ears making him jump up with a shiver going down his back and
then he finally asked," What?"</P><P>" Are those cat ears and the cat
tail real?" Ino asked.</P><P>" Why do you want to know?"
he asked.</P><P>" Because...JUST TELL ME!"
she yelled.</P><P>" Leave me alone I don't need to
tell you," he said in a cold tone.</P><P>" JUST TELL US NARUTO-BAKA!"
yelled Sakura who threw a punch at Naruto, but he just moved his head
back and said <B>Psychic.</B></P><P>" What I can't move. What are you
doing?" she asked in a angry tone.</P><P>" Now now Sakura, be angry won't
make this any less embarrasing for you," he said while getting
out of his seat and walked down to the teacher's desk in the front of
the classroom.</P><P>" Let me go so I can't be the crap
out of you," she said.</P><P><B>" Know who you're talking to,"</B>
Naruto said causing everyone to cringe in fear;even Sasuke.</P><P>" I'm s-sorry," she said and
then she fell to the ground.</P><P>" If you want me I'll be out
training," he said while walking towards the door.</P><P>"But we're suppose to stay here,"
they said.</P><P>" I'm guessing that our senseis
won't be here for another hour," he said.</P><P>" How do you know that?"
asked Ino.</P><P>" Because when I was on my way
here I saw the jounins drinking sake so I'm guessing there be out for
another hour," he said," See ya."</P><P><I>On the Training Grounds</I></P><P>" Hey Mewtwo come out," said
Naruto.</P><P><B>" No,"</B> Mewtwo said.</P><P>" Why not?" asked Naruto.</P><P><B>" Because I've been helping you
for 2 weeks and got nothing in return,"</B> he said.</P><P>" Fine I'll get you one of those
Icha Icha Paradise books," he said.</P><P><B>Mewtwo started blushing," Okay
I'll train if you get me one of those,"</B> he said.</P><P><I>" Just like I thought a big
pervert,"</I> Naruto thought.</P><P><B>" I can hear you,"</B>
Mewtwo said.</P><P>" Whatever lets train. Summon!"
he yelled bringing out Mewtwo.</P><P>Naruto ran at Mewtwo and used Kage
Bunshin making 2 more Narutos who then used <B>Psychic</B> to make
Mewtwo stay in his place, but Mewtwo just broke out of it and then
used <B>Confusion </B>to make them attack Naruto. The Narutos ran at
him and was about to punch him, but Naruto used<B> Teleport </B>to
dodge them and get behind Mewtwo, but Mewtwo used <B>Psychic</B> to
trap Naruto and then he threw him into a tree. Naruto got back up and
felt himself healing thinks to the Kyuubi's chakra. Naruto ran at
Mewtwo and was about to hit him, but he just used <B>Shadow Ball</B>
to hit him with it, but the Naruto just poofed away. Mewtwo looked
around trying to find him when all of a sudden he felt an increase
source of chakra, but couldn't find it.</P><P><B>" Come out Naruto,"</B>
said Mewtwo.</P><P><B>" Shadow Ball!"</B> Naruto
yelled, but couldn't see where it was coming from until he felt the
ground shake a little so he realized Naruto was under him so he
jumped into the air and hit the <B>Shadow Ball</B> with his own
making it go away.</P><P><B>" Ha take that you baka! Now
come out so I can take you down like last time!"</B> Mewtwo
yelled to Naruto.</P><P>" Okay...<B>Teleport</B>," he
said making Mewtwo look around to try and find him, but he decided to
look up to see if he was there and then the next thing he knew he was
on the ground.</P><P>" Ha take that perverted Pokemon!"
he yelled to Mewtwo.</P><P><B>" Oh shut up you baka,"</B>
said Mewtwo in annoyance.</P><P>" Hey do you know how to make me
look like me again?" asked Naruto.</P><P><B>" Of course, but you will still
have the cat ears and cat tail,"</B> Mewtwo said.</P><P>" Oh come on its because of those
stupid things that I got hugged to death," Naruto said in an
angry tone.</P><P><B>" Oh well;now it's almost time
to meet your sensei so I'm leaving and also don't complain about
having those ears and that tail on you because if you do I shall hurt
you,"</B> Mewtwo said which achieved in making Naruto scared.</P><P>" Well at least I don't look like
some weirdo well except for the tail and the ears I look like old me
and also the baby fat is gone," he said while he teleported back
to the academy.</P><P><I>" Ninja Academy</I></P><P>" Hi guys," Naruto said which
made almost everyone in the class jump up and scream.</P><P>" What the crap Naruto," said
Kiba.</P><P>" What it's not my fault most of
you are scaredy cats," said Naruto who was showing off his foxy
grin making all the girls in the classroom blush.</P><P>" Well it's almost time, I give
another minute before they come in," he said.</P><P>Just like Naruto said the jounin came
in right on que.</P><P>" Sorry for being late we kinda
had a party this morning and might've gotten drunk," Kurenai
said.</P><P>" Whatever," said Naruto.</P><P>" Oh team 7 Kakashi can't be here
because something happened at the bar and he won't be able to see you
for a week," said Kurenai.</P><P>" Okay see you later," said
Naruto as he walked out of the room.</P><P>" Hey Sasuke want to go a date,"
asked Sakura.</P><P>" No I have more important things
to do than go out on a date," he said.</P><P>Sasuke walked away leaving a very sad
Sakura standing there.</P><P><I>At Naruto's house</I></P><P>" Geez today was boring,"
said Naruto to himself.</P><P><B>" Well you didn't get to meet
your sensei today,"</B> said Mewtwo.</P><P>" That's tr-" started Naruto
when he heard someone knocking at his door.</P><P>" Coming!" yelled Naruto.</P><P>Naruto opened the door and saw Hinata
standing there.</P><P>" Hi Hinata what do you want?"
asked Naruto.</P><P>" I LOVE YOU NARUTO!" she
yelled.</P><P>Now Naruto knew Hinata liked him after
gaining Alakazam's intelligence, but he never knew that she would
come and tell him.</P><P>" I don't know what to say,"
he said.</P><P>" I'm sorry for saying that know I
just wanted you to know how I feel," she said about to run away
when all of a sudden Naruto caught her.</P><P>" Hinata I don't know what to say,
but I'll say you are one of my precious people and yes I will go out
with you," he said making Hinata faint with happiness.</P><P>" Well I better take back to her
house and then go to sleep," he said while he picked her up,
carried her bridal style, and took her back to her home. Little did
he know he was being watched.</P><P><B>" He has grown,"</B> one
said.</P><P><B>" Yes, but he doesn't have
enough power yet," </B>the other said.</P><P><B>" Well lets see how strong he
is in the Land of Waves,"</B> the first one said and then they
left.</P><P>A/N Sorry I had to make it short, but I
kinda ran out of ideas</P><P>Well; Who are these guys and what do
they want with Naruto.</P><P><B>Next Chapter</B></P><P><B>Naruto meets his sensei</B></P><P>Naruto: " What took you so long,"</P><P>Then Naruto goes on his first C-rank

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><B>Naruto
Namikaze Uzumaki</B></P><P><B> Pokemorph</B></P><P><B> Chapter 3</B></P><P><B>Naruto Meets His
Sensei</B></P><P>Naruto was asleep when all of a sudden
he woke up in a sewer-like place.</P><P>" Where am I?" asked Naruto.</P><P><B>" You are in your mind,"</B>
said a familiar voice.</P><P>" Is that you, Mewtwo?" asked
Naruto.</P><P><B>" Yes I am and its time you
meet Kyuubi,"</B> he said.</P><P>" Okay," Naruto said walking
with Mewtwo to a huge cage with a tag with a kanji for the word
'seal' on it.</P><P><B>" HELLO I'M THE GREAT KYUUBI no
KITSUNE!!!" </B> yelled Kyuubi.</P><P>" Hello I'm Naruto Uzumaki,"
said Naruto calmly.</P><P><B>" You're not afraid of me?"</B>
asked Kyuubi.</P><P>" Not really because I know you
have been helping me since I was a kid and if you wanted me dead you
would have tricked me when I was a kid to get you out," he said.</P><P><B>" Well you're right I don't
want you dead," said Kyuubi.</B></P><P>" I need to ask you something,"
said Naruto.</P><P><B>" What is it," Kyuubi
asked.</B></P><P>" Are you a boy or a girl?"
asked Naruto.</P><P><B>" A girl. Wait let me change
into something more comfortable,"</B> she said and then she
transformed into a 6 foot tall blood red haired woman. She was
wearing a red kimono that looked to be too small for her and she had
long slender legs and a bust that was even bigger than Tsunade's.</P><P>Naruto was staring at her and blushing
with some blood coming out of his nose and he also muttered "
Beautiful " which thanks to Kyuubi's advanced hearing she heard
and blushed faintly.</P><P><B>" Well is this better?"
</B>she asked which got a nod from Naruto who was still staring at
her which made her giggle.</P><P>" Well Kyu-chan I need to go and
wake up," he said without realizing he added the chan suffix to
her name, but she realized it and blushed.</P><P><B>" Wait Naru-kun I need to give
you something,"</B> she said and adding the kun suffix made
Naruto blush.</P><P>" What is it?" he asked.</P><P><B>" I'm going to give you the
scroll to summon kitsunes and also I'm going to give you another
pokemon,"</B> she said shocking Naruto and Mewtwo.</P><P>" Which one is it?!" asked
Naruto.</P><P><B>" Its a Ninetales,"</B>
she said.</P><P>" Thanks, but can I get that
summoning scroll?" he asked.</P><P><B>" Okay here you go,"</B>
she said and then threw it to him.</P><P>" Cool so how do I do this?"
he asked which made Kyuubi and Mewtwo both facevault.</P><P><B>" You sign your name on it with
blood,"</B> she said.</P><P>" Okay," he said and quickly
signed it and gave it back to Kyuubi, " Thank you for letting me
sign this." he said and then walked through the bars and hugged
Kyuubi making her blush and also since she is so much taller than him
his face went into her chest.</P><P><B>" Your welcome Naru-kun,"</B>
she said.</P><P>Naruto stopped hugging her and then
went over to the Ninetails and started petting it making it happy so
he then fused with it and quickly grew 9 tails with flame red tips on
the ends of them, two fox ears that are a mix of gold and yellow, red
eyes with black slits for each one, his hair is wilder than before,
his nails are sharper than before, and his whiskers are thicker than
before. Kyuubi started to unconsciously lick her lips and her eyes
had lust in them.</P><P>" No offense Mewtwo, but I like
this form better than yours," Naruto said and started laughing
which made Mewtwo mad.</P><P>" Hey Kyuubi," said Naruto.</P><P><B>" Yes Naru-kun?" </B>asked
Naruto.</P><P>" Do you want to get out of the
seal?" he asked.</P><P><B>" Yes!!! Of course!!!"</B>
she yelled.</P><P>" Well I know how-," he
started, but was cut off when Kyuubi jumped on him and started
hugging him... hard.</P><P><B>" Thank you, thank you, thank
you,"</B> she started saying.</P><P>" Can you let go of me?" he
asked suffocating.</P><P><B>" Sorry,"</B> she said.</P><P>" Okay like I was saying all we
need to do to get you out is have you bite my neck and let me bite
yours and we both send chakra to each other overpowering the seal on
you and you'll be out. Now the only thing that is about this is that
you will be under my control, but trust me I won't take control of
you at all," Naruto said quickly breathing in air after saying
that.</P><P><B>" I'll do it, I'll do it!"
</B>she yelled and started hugging him again.</P><P>" Okay lets do it!" he yelled
quickly getting out of the death hug and then she bit his neck and he
bit hers and they both started channeling chakra into each other.
They both started to feel the seal weaken so Naruto stopped and tried
to get away, but Kyuubi held him still and started licking where she
bit until she noticed what she was doing, let go, and started
blushing... Hinata style.</P><P><B>" Sorry,"</B> she said.</P><P>" It's okay," he said also
blushing.</P><P>They looked at their necks and saw that
they had a tattoo of nine tails connected to each other and made it
look like a necklace.</P><P>" Well lets go," he said.</P><P><B>" Yeah,"</B> she said.</P><P>All of a sudden they were thrusted out
of his mind and back into his newly transformed body.</P><P>He woke up and saw Kyuubi laying next
to him and also sleeping so he tried to wake her up, but it didn't
work so he kissed her on the forehead waking her up and also making
him blush.</P><P>" Well I know how to wake you up
now," he said.</P><P><B>( Since she's in human form her
voice isn't going to sound demonic)</B></P><P>" Yeah well it's okay, but next
time you can do it on the lips," she said teasingly and then
started to laugh seeing Naruto blush.</P><P>" Well I need to get dressed and I
also need to go see my sensei," he said putting on his clothes.</P><P>" Can I come to I don't want to be
here by myself without you," she said blushing faintly. <I>Kyuubi
has gotten a crush on Naruto since he actually met her and got her
out of the seal. Also that new seal that Naruto and her made had made
her want to be closer her to him.</I></P><P>" Well lets go!" yelled
Naruto.</P><P>" Okay lets go," she said.</P><P><I>At the Academy</I></P><P>" Where were you Naruto!"
yelled Sakura.</P><P>" At my house traing with
Kyu-chan," he said.</P><P>" Who's Kyu-chan and why would she
live with you. You're just a dobe!" yelled Sakura.</P><P>" I'm Kyu-chan and you better not
bother or mock Naru-kun if you know what's good for you," Kyuubi
said.</P><P>Sakura and Sasuke both look towards
where the voice came from and saw one of the most beautiful women
ever. Sasuke saw her and decided that she should be with her and not
the dobe.</P><P>" Hi beautiful why don't you get
with me and not this dobe," said Sasuke about to touch her when
all of a sudden his hand was caught by something.</P><P><B>" If you dare touch her I will
break all of your bones!"</B> said Naruto with a demonic voice.</P><P>" Leave me alone dobe, I can do
what ever I want I'm an Uchiha," said Sasuke getting his hand
away from Naruto and trying to touch her again when all of a sudden
he found himself in a hole in the wall.</P><P><B>" What did I say you teme!"</B>
yelled Naruto in a demonic voice again.</P><P>" How dare you do that to Sasuke
dobe," said Sakura about to punch him, but all of a sudden
Naruto said <B>" Psychic"</B> making her stand still.</P><P>" Shut up Sakura and to think I
thought of you as a sister, but you're just like Sasuke. You think
you're better than me just because I made low grades, but have you
ever thought that I was hiding my true self?" asked Naruto.</P><P>" I know you weren't because you
are a dobe," said Sakura still stuck in Psychic.</P><P>" Okay then Kyu-chan do you mind
to send her into the wall with Sasuke?" asked Naruto.</P><P>" Okay Naru-chan," she said
and quickly kicked her into the hole with Sasuke.</P><P>" Hi guys," said Kakashi.</P><P>" Hi sensei," said Naruto.</P><P>" Where's the other two?"
asked Kakashi.</P><P>" Over there," he said
pointing to the hole.</P><P>" Owww," they both said
getting out of the hole.</P><P>" Now lets meet at the roof,"
he said.</P><P>" Kyu-chan hold on to me," he
said and then she hugged him.</P><P>" This good enough?" she
asked.</P><P>" Yeah. <B>Teleport</B>," he
said and Sasuke and Sakura were standing there amazed and angry.</P><P><I>" Why that dobe gets a hottie
and those powers. I'm going to get her thanks to the council and I'm
going to get that power when I get the Sharigan,"</I> he thought
smirking.</P><P><I>" That dobe thinking he's
stronger than us well we're stronger and when I prove how strong I am
Sasuke is going to be in love with me,"</I> thought Sakura with
hearts in her eyes and an evil grin on her face.</P><P><I>On the roof top</I></P><P>" Well now that we're here tell me
about yourselves," Kakashi said.</P><P>" Why don't you tell us about
you?" asked Sakura.</P><P>" Fine, My name is Kakashi Hatake 
I have a lot of likes and a lot of dislikes, I have a lot of hobbies,
and I never thought of a dream. So you first pinky," he said and
everyone thought that they just got his name.</P><P>" I like (looks at Sasuke), My
hobbies are (looks at Sasuke), my dreams for the future are ( looks
at Sasuke), and I hate Naruto and Ino pig!" she yelled.</P><P><I>" Great a fangirl,"</I>
thought Kakashi.</P><P>" You next emo kid," said
Kakashi.</P><P>" I have a lot of likes, I hate
that dobe, I have a lot of hobbies, and my dreams for the future is
to restore my clan and kill a certain man," he said.</P><P><I>" Great an emo avenger,"</I>
thought Kakashi.</P><P><I>" Great a gay emo avenger,"</I>
thought Naruto and Kyuubi.</P><P><I>" I hope I can help him with
the first thing,"</I> thought Sakura.</P><P>" Okay you blondie," said
Kakashi making the others mad because Naruto didn't get a stupid
name.</P><P>" I like Kyu-chan( making Kyuubi
blush and Sasuke growl), Hinata-chan, Jiji-san, Iruka-sensei, and
ramen, I hate pinky over there, the emo kid, people who kill for fun,
push other people who are weaker for fun, and leave their teammates
by themself on missions, my hobbies include hanging out with Kyu-chan
and training, and my dream is to protect my precious people and
become the Hokage," said Naruto getting an approving smile from
Kakashi which no one could see.</P><P>" Also Naruto who is this?"
asked Kakashi looking at Kyuubi.</P><P>" This is Kyuu-chan," said
Naruto.</P><P>" Also are those tails and ears
real?" he asked.</P><P>" Yes," Naruto said.</P><P>" Okay well meet me at training
ground seven for your test," he said.</P><P>" Wait I thought we already had
our tests?" asked Sakura.</P><P>" Those were just to see if you
had the skills to become a genin, but we have to have a test to see
if we can work as a team," Naruto said getting confused looks
from Sasuke and Sakura, but a surprised look from Kakashi.</P><P>" What he said and also don't eat
breakfast or you'll throw up," said Kakashi getting shocked
looks from Sasuke and Sakura," Dismissed except for Naruto I
want to take you to see the Hokage," said Kakashi.</P><P>" Okay lets go Kyu-chan," he
said getting up and then Kyuubi hugged him,<B> " Teleport"</B></P><P>Naruto and Kyuubi disappeared from
sight getting more surprised looks from the three except for Sasuke
who had an angry look on his face.</P><P><I>" I will get that power,"</I>
thought Sasuke.</P><P>A/N Sorry I didn't get to the Waves

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>A/N Yeah I bet you're pissed at me for not updating this fic in a long time, but to tell you the truth I kinda forgot I had this so yeah, hehe. I also have changed my mind about a few things you will find out later. So lets get started.<p>I do not own Naruto nor Pokemon<p>Sarutobi sighed as he continued to fight his paperwork. " Man this freaking sucks! I wish something interesting would happen!" Sarutobi yelled to the heavens. Suddenly Naruto, Kyuubi, and Kakashi appeared. " Thank you," Sarutobi whispered.<p>" Sorry for barging in on you Hokage-sama," Kakashi told him after bowing. Naruto and Kyuubi looked at him, flashed the same kind of smile, and said," Hey old man." Both Sarutobi and Kakashi sweatdropped at this before Sarutobi noticed Naruto's and Kyuubi's fox features.<p>" Naruto-kun what happened to you? And who's this?" Sarutobi asked him with a serious look on his face. Naruto and Kyuubi (ironically) had slight scared faces. " Well old man. This is the Kyuubi no Kitsune and before you get freakin scared and call the ANBU, she's very nice. The reason I'm like this is because of my family's bloodline which I found out about the other day when I stole the Sacred Scroll. I think it's time you tell me who my parents are, don't you think the same, <B>old man</B>," Naruto said while growling at them and while fire surrounds him.<p>Sarutobi was literally shaking in his chair from the face Naruto was giving him. He knew he was stronger then Naruto, but the face he was getting, it just creeped him out.<p>After calming down, Sarutobi looked at Naruto and told him to sit down as well as Kyuubi to do the same. Naruto sat down and Kyuubi sat down on his lap ignoring his protests. Sarutobi took out his pipe and sat down. He told Kakashi that he wanted to tell Naruto alone. Kakashi nodded his head and left, but he was still wondering why Kyuubi got to stay.<p>" Okay Naruto-kun, your father is Minato Namikaze, the 4th Hokage," he stopped as he saw Naruto's shocked face before continuing," and your mother is Kushina Uzumaki, she was the previous container for the Kyuubi." Naruto stared at Kyuubi shocked and looked like he was about to say something, but he shut his mouth and nodded towards Sarutobi telling him to continue.<p>" Okay, to tell you the truth your mother is still alive," Sarutobi told him. Naruto jumped up in shock, accidently knocking Kyuubi off him, and yelled," SHE IS? WHERE IS SHE? WHY ISN'T SHE STILL HERE?" Sarutobi got out of his chair, walked over to Naruto, and rubbed his back.<p>" Calm down Naruto. Help Kyuubi back up, sit down, and listen okay," Sarutobi told him. Naruto nodded, bent down, apologized to Kyuubi, then sat down, and listened.<p>" We found her at the sight where she was going to give birth to you. She didn't have you in the hospital because the seal keeping Kyuubi in is weakened during childbirth. After healing her and taking her where you were. She was happy to see that you were alive until she saw your whiskermarks. She instantly thought Kyuubi had possessed you and left Konoha. I'm sorry Naruto," Sarutobi told him.</P><P>Naruto looked down at the ground and started to cry. After seeing this, Kyuubi quickly pulled him into a hug and rocked him back and forth hoping to calm him down. After settling down, Naruto looked back up at Sarutobi and asked," Old man do you think my dad would still love me if he had survived?" Sarutobi smiled and told him," Yes, in fact, Minato told me to tell the village to treat you as a hero, so I am 100% positive he would love you."<p>Naruto smiled and nodded to Sarutobi as he stood back up. " I'm going home now old man," Naruto told him. He grabbed Kyuubi and started saying, "<B>Tele-</B>" before being cut off by Sarutobi. " Naruto! Before I forget, here this is the key belonging to the Uzumaki compound here in Konoha."<p>Naruto, having studied the Uzumaki clan after finding out his heritage, looked at Sarutobi and asked him," Wait they never had a compound here, they didn't even live in Konoha, they lived in Uzushiogakure before it was destroyed. I know some of them lived here like Mito Uzumaki, the husband of the 1st Hokage, but I know that there wasn't enough Uzumakis here to make a compound."<p>" I know Naruto, but, since Konoha and Uzushiogakure were on such good terms, we let them build a compound here just in case something did happen to Uzushiogakure. After it was destroyed only 10-15 Uzumakis came here, the others went to other villages. I do not know what happened to the other Uzumakis that lived here, but since they arent here and you are a Uzumaki, it belongs to you," Sarutobi told him while giving him a fatherly smile.<p>Naruto smiled and jumped over the desk and gave Sarutobi a hug. After finishing the hug, Naruto and Kyuubi got ready to teleport again. " Okay lets try this again.<B> Teleport.</B> Oh yeah old man use the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu to finish pa-" Naruto got cut off after he completely vanished.<p>Sarutobi just stared at where he stood and said," Thank you Naruto-kun!" before making 5 bunshin and pulled out a copy of Icha Icha and giggled at it.<p>Back with Naruto<p>After arriving at his apartment, him and Kyuubi grabbing everything, and then teleporting over to the Uzumaki Compound. " This place is huge," Kyuubi said. Naruto just nodded dumbly with wide eyes. They finally shook their heads, opened the gate, and walked in.<p>Naruto and Kyuubi looked around and Naruto saw that the largest house was in the middle of the compound. " That is so mine!" Naruto yelled happily as he ran into it like a little kid. Kyuubi just sighed before smiling and walking in after him.<p>Naruto ran up the stairs, which they were a lot of, and saw that the master bedroom was on the top. He ran in, packed his stuff away, grabbed a piece of paper out of nowhere, wrote on it, and stuck it to the door. Naruto laughed as he jumped onto the bed. " Man this is so soft!" Naruto yelled as he felt his eyelids grow heavy before finally falling asleep.<p>Kyuubi finally got to the top and saw the little piece of paper he stuck to the door. It said, <I>" Naruto's Room!"</I> with a little chibi him giving a piece sign under the words. " That baka," Kyuubi said to herself before walking down the stairs to find her own room.<p><I>3 hours later<p></I>Naruto shot up in his bed and rubbed his eyes as well as yawned. " *yawn* where am I...oh yeah. What time is it?" he asked himself. He looked over at the clock and saw that it said 11:30 p.m. " I'm going for a walk," he said outloud.<p>He ran down the stairs and saw that Kyuubi was sleeping in the room under his. " Awwww she's more cute then beautiful hehe," Naruto smirked as he said this and kept running.<p>After reaching the bottom, he opened the gates and walked out. He walked down the streets of Konoha, ignoring the stares full of hate directed at him. Suddenly a guy stood in front of him. " I...Im going to *hiccup*...kill you demon!" Naruto just sighed as he realized that this guy was drunk. He was thinking of what to do when he suddenly heard a voice in his head. <I>" Do flamethrower"</I><p>Naruto just shrugged and yelled," <B>Flamethrower!"</B> Suddenly a huge gust of fire shot out of his mouth and almost hit the poor guy, but it kept going and smashed into a building. " Ah!" the drunken guy yelled as he ran away as did everybody else.<p>Smoke came out of Naruto's mouth. Naruto...well Naruto was running around fanning at his mouth and yelling," Water! Water! I need water!"<p>Unknown to him, a silhouette of a monster had jumped out of the way of the flamethrower. " Interesting, that kid almost hit me, even if he didn't know that he was about to. I know that kid would not use a move like that just out on the street since I've been following him and it doesnt seem that he noticed me so why the hell did he shoot that thing at me?" the thing said before disappearing out of the village.<p>Naruto finally got a glass of water from a random guy on the street and was on his way back to the Uzumaki compound. " Damn it! I'm lost!" Naruto yelled angrily as he kicked a pebble. Suddenly he heard someone grunt in pain a few feet away from him.<p>He ran over to the person and saw that the guy was unconscious with a pebble lying next to his head causing Naruto to sweatdrop. " I can't believe I knocked someone out with a pebble," Naruto mumbled as he rubbed the back of his head.<p>He continued walking around when he bumped into someone. " Ooof sorry...wait Hinata? Hi!" Naruto yelled happily. He looked at her and noticed that there was something different about her. " Hello Naruto-kun," she said back, not even stuttering, stunning him.<p>" I just now realized when do you want to go out on our date?" Naruto asked her with his foxy smile. " I'm sorry, but I was mistaken when I told you I love you, I actually love someone else after thinking about it," Hinata told him.<p>Naruto felt part of him was broken after hearing this. Yes he also had feelings for Hinata, not as strong as hers, but still kinda strong, but after hearing this...he just feels like he lost something important.<p>Hinata looked at him with a sad look before walking away.<p>And! cut.<BR>Phew I thought I was just going to stop at some parts of this chapter, but I was able to get through.<p>Yeah I bet you're shocked. Hinata is out of the harem and please don't complain if you have seen my profile you know that I dont like NaruHina. I just started out with it because the guy I adopted this from wanted it to be NaruHina, but I have decided...I just dont think I can add Hinata in the harem so I'm sorry.<p>Yeah also I'm changing the harem. I haven't decided about who all is going to be in it. So you can leave reviews saying who you want to be in it. I will also allow Kushina to be in it, but only if I get enough reviews asking for her.<p>I will also add female versions of characters if you want. So yeah<p>Ja Ne</P>
