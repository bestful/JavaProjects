It was around noon and no one was here, one of the chunin guarding the gate was about to poke himself in the eye with a kunai till he saw something traveling at high speeds tworeds the gate. When it got closer he saw some of the features on the now identified human male with platinum white hair and black sunglasses on, (think blade) with a black travelers cloak, and a black half face mask. The chunin instantly went on alert signaling the other chunin with a subtle head movement. A few seconds later the white haired man stopped in front of the two alerted chunin.</p><p>"Halt! State your name a reason for visiting Konoha!" asked the now intimidated chunin. Now you may ask why he's intimidated well he's around 5"6' and this man is around, from what he can see 6"2' maybe 3' and muscular compared to his lanky build.</p><p>The man look at him clearly amused even through his facemask you can see that. "My name is."</p><p>'Hmm what should I go by hime?' Thought the man inwardly until he felt her respond and felt the blush on her cheeks from the nickname. "My name is Kazama Arishi I am here to see lady Hokage." Stated the now named Arishi. The chunin told him to wait there while he went to call an ANBU to escort him to the Hokage tower. The chunin came back a few minutes later with Two ANBU, one with a Bear mask and one with a Neko mask. Arishi went with them to the Tower sighing as he did so.</p><p>At the same time in the tower in question we find the Fifth Hokage right at work with her assistant Shizune standing at her side watching her mentor with a sad gleam in her eyes.</p><p>'She still hasn't gotten over it. I don't think any of us really did' Shizune thought sadly to herself. It's been five years since Naruto went on the training trip with Jiraiya and four years since he went missing from said training trip. And two years since the search stopped and Naruto presumed dead. A week after Naruto disappeared. Jiraiya contacted Tsunade to inform her of what happened to her little brother. To say she was worried was an understatement she was haveing a panic attack. She sent teams 8, 10 and Gai's in order to help Jiraiya with the search the teams came back a few weeks later with nothing. Jiraiya was determined to find him he used as many resources he had to find him two years later he came back looking utterly defeated with nothing of Naruto. It was as if he just vanished into thin air.</p><p>When Jiraiya came back with nothing Tsunade practically shut down she stopped drinking and didn't even leave her house. When she came back she looked horrible her eyes were red and had bags under them her closes looked unclean and she also hadn't showered in days. Simply she was a mess, it took her a few months but with Shizune helping her along the way she had gotten sort of back to herself accept this time all she did was work and hand out missions go home and lay in bed and cry. It was the best Shizune could ask for under the circumstances and even that took two years to get.</p><p>Soon there was a knock at the door breaking Shizune from her thoughts. "Come in." said Tsunade with and irritated voice. The door opened showing two ANBU and a white haired man. "What is it?" damanded the irritated Hokage.</p><p>"Hokage-sama this man wishes to speak with you." said the Neko ANBU Gesturing to the white haired man.</p><p>"Yes thank you, your dismissed." Said the still irritated Hokage. The two ANBU nodded and poofed out of the offic all the while Tsunade looking intently at the man who wanted to speak with her. Once the door was shut while still looking intently at him she asked "Who are you and what do you want."<p>The man just chuckled and said with a mock hurt voice "I'm hurt Baa-Chan that you don't remember me. Well I guess not many would I have been gone for five years."</p>
