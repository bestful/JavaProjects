his boss is a female. She dated her and they became close. After
learning that about his new girlfriend's real gender through one of
the co workers, and despite their warnings that he should keep
distance from her, he continued his relationship with her. But after
learning that Naruto had no interest in him at all, he tried
something drastic. Never did he realized that it would lead to more
heart breaks and lots of suffering. SasuNaru KyuuNaru</p><P>o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</p><p>Sasuke scowled at
the letter in his hands. He is a perfect individual. He is smart,
talented and hardworking. He was the valedictorian in his elementary
times and the summa cum laude in his college acing his way through
honor and glory without even dropping a sweat. Sasuke is a man who
values pride above all others and thats what caused his displeasure.
<p></p><p>It was two weeks
ago when he looked through the classified Ads in a newspaper and
found a decent job at the Kyuubi Industries. It is a popular company
which dominated the food supplies as well as metal poduction in the
world which made it an unmatched and unchallenged company when it
comes to its income and global influence.</p><p>The company was
looking for a set of individuals who are capable of performing
different tasks for the company. The role you receive depends on your
abilities. And Sasuke, is a kind of man who deserves to gain the
highest rank possible. But now what? The company did accept him.
However, there is one problem. He was accepted as a secretary for
their vice president. Though the position is quite high, it wounded
his pride to be accepted in a job, that is way too low in his
standards.</p><P><p>As much as he
hated the job, he realized he no longer had a choice since he himself
pleaded with his father to be set free. And now, his father wouldn't
accept him in the Uchiha household anymore. Glaring at the letter, he
finally stuffed it in his pocket and put on his jacket.</p><p>o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-<p>Sasuke
found himself standing in front of a twenty-storey building that had
the most advanced technology installed. After putting on a smug
expression in his face, he stood in front of the door and
automatically, the door opened and he was ushered inside by a
mechanical guard. Minutes later, he found himself sitting in a chair
facing a man with a bored and lazy expression on his face.<p>Sasuke
coughed to gain attention and the man, which was halfway to sleeping
directed his attention to him.<p>"Oh yes. I trust that you
are Uchiha Sasuke. I am Shikamaru, this company's overall in charge.
And as a man in such position, it is my duty to give you your
assignment. If you..."<p></p><p>Before the man
could finish, Sasuke interrupted him, impatient to get on with his
work. "Listen, I don't care who you are or what your duties are.
I want to know what is it that I should do and who my employer is."</p><p>The man
muttered a "Troublesome" under his breath and turned to
Sasuke.</p><p>"Alright.
You are to assist Uzumaki Naruto-sama, the vice president of this
company. You're job is quite simple. Just follow whatever it is that
your boss demands and you'll be fine. Your pay is quite good, about
10,000 dollar every month so I expect no complaints from the boss
about some attitude problems or any kind of disobedience.The boss is
waiting for you in the 19th floor. Just find the vice president's
office and you can get started. You may leave as soon as you want."</p><p>With a push of
a button, the mechanical guard led Sasuke to the 19th floor and left
him alone to find the Vice President.<p></p><p>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-<p>Sasuke
opened a big door and found a chair's back facing him. A high-pitched
feminine voice told him to sit and he did what he was told.</p><p>"Uchiha
Sasuke?"<p></p><p>"Yes
Uzumaki-sama."</p><p>"There's
no need to be formal with me. Just Naruto is fine. I trust that
Shikamaru had briefed you with your duties and roles under me. Am I
right?</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Then you
may start right away. First, you need to arrange these files and take
it to the data processing room. And..." As the chair turned,
Sasuke saw the most gorgeous girl he ever saw. As his boss continued
to talk, the voice no longer reached his ears as he stared at the
stunning girl in front of him. He watched, stunning blue eyes that
seems to glow with life, sweet and innocent face; pink kissable lips;
three weird whisker marks on each cheeks, adorable golden hair and
sweet angelic voice. The girl was the most beautiful creature he had
ever met and right there, Sasuke know he had fallen in love with his
boss.</p><P>o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-</p><P>Message: Well, thats
all for the prologue. I am trying an AU And OOC. Don't worry, if you
are confused, everything will be explained as the story progressed.
See you next time!</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Sasuke woke up in his
appointed room. Since yesterday, he was assigned to a room inside the
company to keep his mind on his tasks and to eliminate any
distractions.<p></p><p>Switching to
sitting position, he yawned indicating lack of sleep.<p></p><p>Since he met his
boss, that beautiful, innocent face always invaded his thoughts. He
can no longer concentrate on sleeping and arranging his boss'
schedule as he pictured that woman, underneath him, screaming his
name and moaning as he thrust in and out, wait... What was he
thinking? Sasuke slapped himself for that thought. It wasn't a common
practice for an Uchiha to let love get in the way of his perfect
image. And Sasuke realized that his love had affected his job.<p></p><p>Trying to get the
images out of his mind, he regained his perfect expression, but he
know that not sooner than this, those images would continue to haunt
him. Sighing, he stood up and made his way to the bathroom to have a
nice cold shower to eliminate his raging erection.<p></p><p>After putting on
his newly acquired uniform, he made his way towards Naruto's office
and knocked.<p></p><p>"Come in."
That's just what Sasuke need to hear and he pushed the 'open' button
to the door. After making his way in, he saw Naruto in the most
revealing outfit he ever saw. Short, above the knee skirt but it
still have some formal look into it. Sasuke let his eyes wander and
stare at those thighs that captivated his attention. As his eyes
travelled to the upper region, he frowned at the long jacket. But
what caught his attention was that there is no bulge between her
chest. Sasuke then thought that she might be just a flat-chested
woman and he shrugged thinking that her perfection still outweighs
her flaws. Sasuke stared some more at the curves of her body then a
voice caught his attention.</p><p>"Sasuke?"
His boss is now staring at him and an expression of realization lit
up his face. "Oh, I am sorry for the revealing outfit. But our
boss or best known as the president, wanted every girl to be in this
kind of uniform. I would love to change this but its not my place to
complain" She blushed a little but just gave him a grin to hide
her embarassment.</p><p>Sasuke snapped
out of his daze. "Oh, no its fine Naruto. I don't mind."<p></p><p>"Really?"
Naruto beamed at him with a widest grin Sasuke could find. Sasuke
frowned at that. Yesterday, she was acting strict and professional,
now she was treating him like a friend. Is this woman bipolar or
something? But he need not wonder anymore as Naruto realized the look
on Sasuke's face.<p></p><p>"Sasuke? What
is it?"<p></p><p>"Uhm... Its
just I am wondering why you are such in a cheerful mood today maam."</p><p>"Hehehe, I
am just in a good mood today. I got a good pounding last night.
Hehehe... And don't call me maam! I told you Naruto is fine, teme!"<p></p><p>"Teme! Is that
a new nickname? You aren't such a creative person dobe!" Sasuke
smirked at the reaction he received. Naruto glared at him.<p></p><p>"Now you
ruined my mood. You have to buy me some ramen." Then Naruto
pouted. That wonderful pout that sent Sasuke to another dreamland as
he stared imagining many different things they could do. Sasuke then
snapped out of it when he heard Naruto yelled in joy.<p></p><p>"Yatta! Now
you can buy me some special ramen. Ramen are expensive food you know.
And they always cheer me up. Now come on, its a day off for the both
of us. I am Kyuubi-sama wont mind!" Naruto declared as she
dragged Sasuke towards the company's cafeteria.</p><p>"Kyuubi-sama?"
Sasuke asked, feeling a bit stupid for asking the question. Of course
he know who that is but he have nothing more to say and it feels rude
for him not to reply to her. As much as he hated to admit it,
Uchiha's are not a good convertionalist people.</p><p>"You don't
know kyuubi-sama? Why, he's the company's owner and president. He is
very wise, strong, and caring. He is also understanding too, and fun
most of the time. So you should be lucky you work under such kind
employer.</p><p>"Ahh...
Thanks for that, I guess." Sasuke just allowed himself to get
dragged by Naruto still wondering what Naruto meant by pounding and
why Naruto seems to know much about kyuubi when it was said that no
workers of the company ever leave their offices.</p><P>o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</p><P>Messages: I am sorry
for the short-ness of this one. Just think of it as some sort of
teaser. XD. But I promise I'll update with longer ones next week. So
please have patience with this one.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Message: I am sorry I only updated at
this time. But don't worry, now that school is over, I can
concentrate in writing.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-</P><P>Sasuke sat in the data processing room
waiting for the company reports. Naruto said that Kyuubi is on an
important business conference and 'she' had the duty to act as the
president for the month. Naruto is supposed to review the company's
stats for the previous year so 'she' could come up with good plans
for improvement and regulation revisions. Sasuke was about to stand
up to send the documents to his boss when he heard a group of people
talking and laughing.</P><P>Curiosity got the better of him and he
came nearer to the chatting group.</P><P>"Now that kyuubi-sama's gone, we can
have all the breaks we could." A rather obnoxious voice said
jokingly.</P><P>"With this place's security, it would
be easy for us to get caught, but its just a good thing that we have
Shikamaru with us. He's a genius when it comes to this place's
security and cameras." The group laughed at this when a lazy voice
replied.</P><P>"Still, Naruto-sama is not someone we
should take lightly. After all, he is the vice president of this
company. It would be too troublesome to get caught. We should lower
our voices. I think someone is coming."</P><P>"Don't worry dude, Naruto, as they
say, is a deadlast. He wont know what we're doing. And even if he
did, I believed he would let us off easily. Unlike Kyuubi-sama, he is
kind and understanding, right?" Said a loud, cheerful voice. While
the group nodded in understanding.</P><P>While Sasuke was listening, he couldn't
help but think why they are referring to her is he, and what the hell
are they doing? They are talking bad things about his dobe behind his
back, in his own company. At this realization, Sasuke's blood started
to boil and he walked faster towards the group, slightly annoyed at
the way they talked about his beloved.</P><P>Sasuke saw Shikamaru and the rest
sitting around a chair eating doughnuts and having some fun chatting
about various topics, that sounded unimportant to a person such as
Sasuke.</P><P>"Oi, Sasuke-kun! You gave us quite a
scare, thank god it's only you. Come over, I'll introduce you to the
group." The voice came from someone familiar and Sasuke realized it
is the one who he dreaded since elementary school. The pink hair was
enough to make his hair stand and his skin crawl.</P><P>Sasuke merely nodded at her and took a
seat in one of the vacant chairs.</P><P>"Sasuke-kun, this is the entire staff
of Kyuubi industries. There aren't many workers as they are replaced
by robots and machines. Anyway, My job here is to see that things in
this place is in order. I am also in charge in health and well-being
of the staff. And this is Kiba, the company's machine and robotic
manager, Gaara, the overall in charge of the facilities and shipments
of products, Shikamaru, the company's overall in charge. You can say,
he is next to the vice-president in terms of power and authority. I
don't know how he get to that position though, as he is so lazy."
-At this the group laughed, while Sakura continued, when Shikamaru
said "Troublesome"- "This is Ino, the chairperson for the Data
processing room. She is the one who handles anything that includes
thinking and analysis. This is Neji, in charge of the company's eyes
and ears. It is his job to report anything that may affect the
company's performance for the better or worse. But lucky for us, Neji
is the one who likes relaxation, so he wouldn't report our favorite
past ties. -she giggled at this before she continued- And Lastly,
these are the repair team, Rock Lee, Choji, Temari, Kankuro and
Tenten. Should there be a virus outbreak or mechanical malfunctions
in different sections of the company, it is their duty to restore the
system back and ensure that the damage is minimal and repairable. But
since the company's technology is highly advanced, the rest of us
don't have much work to do."</P><P>"Though I pity you that you have to
work under a person such as Naruto. He is loud, obnoxious, annoying,
and disagreeable. -she giggled and continued- But, I know you can do
it Sasuke-kun. After all, you are talented, smart and hardworking!
Unlike Naruto, who is just a nuisance to this company. I cant
understand why Kyuubi-sama accepted such failure in our company."</P><P>Sasuke had a bored expression
throughout Sakura's speech, but the last sentence get to his nerve,
enough to make him see red. How dare she insulted his love.</P><P>Without thinking rationally, which
most Uchihas shouldn't do before doing anything, Sasuke rushed
towards Sakura and slammed her against a wall.</P><P>"What did you just say?" Sasuke
asked angrily, losing his cool. Sakura looked at Sasuke with confused
expression.</P><P>"Sasuke-kun? Why are you angry all of
a sudden?" Add to the fuel is the way Sakura's voice sounded, oh so
innocent, like she had no idea what she just said, or its just a
second nature to her when insulting Naruto.</P><P>Sasuke, in his rage, raised his hand
ready to slap Sakura, when Neji grabbed his wrist. "What is your
problem Uchiha? You have been here for barely a minute and you are
already causing a problem. Is that mere insult enough anger you? I
thought Uchihas have better self-control than this."</P><P>Sasuke released Sakura and turned to
face Neji. "Just an insult? What do you think will she feel if she
heard what you are saying?" His eyes narrowed in anger.</P><P>"Hmp. Why do you care? Do you have
some sort of feelings for him? I am warning you Uchiha, don't get too
close to that person or you'll regret it later."</P><P>Sasuke charged at Neji and punched him.
"You do not own the right to order me around Neji! You hae
forgotten that I only answer to Naruto and her alone. I care because
what you are doing is wrong! Heh, what am I doing with these idiots.
I have better things to do than argue with weak-minded fools like
you!."</P><P>At this, Neji lost his cool and before
Sasuke could leave, Neji grabbed his hand and said angrily to him.
"Just because you are his secretary you do not have the right to
say those things to us! If you have some feelings for him, just
remember this, don't get too close to him or you'll surely regret
it." After saying this, Neji regained his composure and let go of
Sasuke's hand, who gladly left the scene without saying a word.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-</P><P>As Sasuke was walking towards Naruto's
office, Sasuke's head was spinning. The recent discussions had had
his head thinking about various topics that had him running in circle
with no answers. For instance, his head was thinking about the team's
dislike about Naruto, why they are talking about her with such hate
and ridicule, though Naruto isn't so wise about stuffs and is an
idiot and annoying at certain times, he cant help but think why they
are so hostile to Naruto. Were they just jealous of his position? Or
do they had some unpleasant experiences with her? And another thing
is why did Neji tell him not to get too close to Naruto. Its not like
that Naruto is a dangerous person. Quite on the contrary, she is a
nice person, a little annoying, but amusing and not someone who judge
people by their popularity and social status. In fact, he couldn't
find something that he could hate in Naruto. Another thing that
bothers him the most is why are they referring to her as a he. But he
decided not to dwell on that. What puzzled him the most was Neji's
last words. Why would he stay away from Naruto? The only reason Neji
said this is Naruto could be a dangerous person or Neji just have
some feelings for Naruto and that he didn't want others to get in the
way.</P><P>Sasuke chose the latter. Feeling rather
displeased that someone else loved his beloved fox, he knocked on the
door that led to Naruto's office. When he was told to come in, he
placed the papers on top of Naruto's desk.</P><P>Naruto faced him. Sensing Sasuke's
anger, he told Sasuke to sit down. "So, Sasuke, how was our day?
What happened to you? Why wear such a displeasing expression?"
Naruto jokingly asked.</P><P>Sasuke just sighed and said jokingly,
"I had a grand reunion with the staff."</P><P>"Oh really? You must had a good time.
They are all hired by Kyuubi-sama and thorough scrutinized their
records and backgrounds himself so I am sure you'll get along with
them well."</P><P>"You have no idea." <I>You're one
to talk like that. It seems that this President isn't so great after
all. Hiring ill-mannered staffs. Che! </I>-Sasuke
thought as Naruto continued to talk-</P><P>"So Sasuke, I'm
about to finish organizing the data you brought. How about some
ramen? You know, to take some break. Facing papers and datas all day
sure is tiring." Naruto grinned at him.</P><P>Sasuke was about to
decline but he couldn't resist Naruto. Times with Naruto always made
him comfortable. Trying to act emotionless, but he failed anyway, as
seeing Naruto happy always warmed his heart, he replied:</P><P>"It doesn't look
like I have much of a choice. Ok then, let's get going." Hearing
this, Naruto pumped his fist on the air and dragged Sasuke along the
cafeteria. Oh yeah, this day have been extremely stressing. Sasuke
only hopes that everything will go fine tomorrow.</P><P>Sasuke just smiled
to himself. Knowing that these next days, life would be brighter for
him.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-</P><P>Message:</P><P>Well, I finally
updated. I am so sorry I haven't updated in a while. But I promise
that next chapter would be better than this. Well, see you all!</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>2 weeks had passed and life had been
very much the same. Sasuke still fantasizing about a certain dobe,
and pondering about his current situation. The past 2 weeks were
uneventful. He never did run into one of the staff, and for that, he
was grateful. All he did was spend time in Naruto's office, talk to
his boss and have ramen with her. It was rather boring, but Sasuke
didn't mind anyway. As long as he could spend the day with his
beloved, everything would be okay.</P><P>Sasuke was still thinking about the
past events, when his boss called him to her office. He happily
obeyed and excitedly entered Naruto's office.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</P><P>Sasuke entered Naruto's office and
looked at Naruto expectantly waiting for orders.</P><P>"Sasuke? I am glad you're here. I
have somethings that has to be done. Kyuubi-sama is about to return
and he detest laziness and unfinished tasks. Help me with categorize
these documents." Naruto then pointed to a pile of paper on his
desk.</P><P>These papers belong to the company's
influential status in the world. While these here belong to the
company's stock and product reports. The third pile of paper is
uncategorized. Arrange them to their respective places. When you're
done, organize the chart and reports in the box and place them inside
an individual envelope." Naruto stated hurriedly before returning
back to her own work.</P><P>Sasuke was surprised at how Naruto
seems to be worried about her work. At times like these, they would
have been at the cafeteria eating ramen and chatting about the
company and its achievements.</P><P>A few moments later, he became too busy
with his work that he decided to drop the subject and not to dwell on
it too much. He continued to do his work in an orderly manner,
determined to be able to do his task, flawlessly.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</P><P>Hours had passed and Sasuke was nearly
done with his work, when he heard Naruto's phone ring...</P><P>"Hello? Yes, this is Uzumaki Naruto
of the Kyuubi Industries." Sasuke noted that the other line was
speaking when Naruto stopped to listen. Then all of the sudden,
Naruto's face was painted with worry and grief.</P><P>"What? Where? OK! I'll go right
away." For what seemed an eternity, Naruto finally placed the phone
on his table and Sasuke noticed a distressed look on Naruto's face.
"Naruto?" Sasuke decided to ask.</P><P>But he wasn't answered as Naruto shed a
tear or two and quickly wiped it away.</P><P>With trembling voice, she ordered,
"Sasuke, tidy things up. I have important things to do. Hurry!"
Judging the sound of his voice, it is clear that Naruto is upset over
something. But the question is, what? Unable to contain his
curiosity, Sasuke asked.</P><P>"Naruto? What happened? Who was
that?" Naruto looked at him, slightly upset.</P><P>"That's none of your business Sasuke.
Now clean this area faster, we need to go now."</P><P>"Yes Maam!" Sasuke did the job
faster than he expected and in a few minutes, he was done and found
himself following a distressed Naruto.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</P><P>Sasuke haven't realized what was
happening. All he know is that he was organizing the data and chart
reports that Naruto ordered him, and the next thing he know is that
he was dragged and now sitting in a speeding car.</P><P>As the car sped, Sasuke noted Naruto's
worried look. It is as though he fear he would lose something so
important in his life. Sasuke's thoughts continued to dwell on
solving whatever it is that caused his lover to be this distressed.</P><P>Naruto was tapping his finger
impatiently. Never in his life had he felt this nervous. Before he
became successful, his life had been a living hell and so it is only
natural for him to be distressed and be nervous about something bad
happening to him. But, the phone call had changed everything. This is
something serious. Even more serious than his life in danger.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</P><P>Finally, after a seemingly long trip,
they reached a corner and the car stopped in front of a big and
expensive-looking hospital. Without waiting for another second,
Naruto jumped out of the car and dragged Sasuke as he rushed to the
reception desk.</P><P>"Can I help you with something?"</P><P>"I'm looking for someone" Naruto
presented his I.D.</P><P>"I'm sorry Uzumaki-sama. I didn't
recognized you. You look really nervous. I suppose you would panic
after what you heard, but don't worry, we have taken care of
everything."</P><P>Naruto breathe a sigh of relieve.</P><P>"Can I visit him?"</P><P>"Of course, Uzumaki-sama. Be careful
though. He is still recovering. But I am sure he wont mind your
presence." The girl gave him a wink, while Naruto blushed a little.</P><P>Sasuke, has witnessed everything that
took place and by the look of Naruto's reaction, he was sure that,
that someone who was hospitalized must be someone who is really
important to the dobe and Sasuke will find out who and what his
relationship to Naruto is.</P><P>"Sasuke, you can just stay here. I'll
go and visit a friend. Wait for me ok?" Sasuke just smiled and
nodded, a plan already forming on his head.</P><P>Naruto walked away while Sasuke
followed him secretly.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</P><P>Naruto entered a well-furnished room
and runs inside. "Kyuu-sama!!"</P><P>A light stirring could be heard and the
figure in the bed rose to a sitting position. He is a stunning man.
With mysterious green eyes that could lure you in, the kind that
could seemingly suck your soul, never to let you go, his angular
jaws added to his strong and majestic appearance as well as his
untamed black hair with red highlight that made him look like a god
on Earth.</P><P>The figure smiled fondly at Naruto.
"Naru-chan, why are you here? I thought you were working."</P><P>"Kyuubi-sama! I was so worried about
you! When I heard about the accident, I came here right away."</P><P>The man just laughed and stroke
Naruto's hair. "You worry too much."</P><P>"What can I do? Without you at my
side I wont definitely survive." Naruto gave him a grin while
Kyuubi just pulled him closer to him. "You're being sappy Naruto.
You're always too professional about almost everything. Had my 2
week-absence affected you that much? AND Besides, I am the great
Kyuubi! I cant die easily." Kyuubi smirked at him while Naruto
blushed madly.</P><P>"Ba-bastard. We're talking about a
plane crash here. You are so lucky to be alive. I am so worried. I
don't know if I could ever see you again!! I was so worried about
you, you know." And Naruto started to cry , too happy to see his
love still alive.</P><P>Kyuubi hugged him tight and smiled to
himself knowing that the boy in front of him is genuinely in love
with him. "Naruto, don't worry, I am here now. And I would never
leave you again. How about I make it up to you hm?"</P><P>Naruto looked at kyuubi expectantly and
said, "Really?"</P><P>"Yup, Whatever you want, you get it."</P><P>"Hmm..." Naruto seem to be deep in
thought. Then he positioned himself on top of Kyuubi. "Let me top
you, for one week" Naruto said with a smirk on his face.</P><P>Kyuubi reddened at the site of his
lover dancing so erotically on top of him. "Wait, Naru-chan,
someone might walk in and see us..."</P><P>"Oh, but you never were worried about
that before, kyuubi-sama." Naruto whispered seductively as he
slipped a hand to reach for Kyuubi's crotch. Kyuubi moaned, unable to
control himself any longer, he pulled his angel in for a hungry,
needy kiss.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o</P><P>From a corner, just outside the room, a
certain Uchiha seethed with anger. "Soon dobe, you'll realize that
you belong to me. I don't know how long have you two been seeing with
each other, but I will no longer stand here and do nothing. And with
that, a new plan on Sasuke's head begin to form, as he returned to
his seat, waiting for his boss to return.</P><P>-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-</P><P>Ok, I hope you liked that chapter. I am
here to explain the whole situations to make it clearer to the
readers. Kyuubi was in a plane crash when he was returning home to
meet his beloved Naru-chan. He was miraculously rescued by a rescue
team and hospitalized in the Kyuubi Industries' Medical branch, and
he told the nurses to inform his beloved. Well, more things will be
clearer as the story progressed.</P>
