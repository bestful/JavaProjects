Rocchio Classification
In machine learning, a nearest centroid classifier or nearest prototype classifier is a classification model that assigns to observations the label of the class of training samples whose mean (centroid) is closest to the observation.

When applied to text classification using tf*idf vectors to represent documents, the nearest centroid classifier is known as the Rocchio classifier because of its similarity to the Rocchio algorithm for relevance feedback.[1]

An extended version of the nearest centroid classifier has found applications in the medical domain, specifically classification of tumors.[2]

Algorithm
Training procedure: given labeled training samples {\displaystyle \textstyle \{({\vec {x}}_{1},y_{1}),\dots ,({\vec {x}}_{n},y_{n})\}} \textstyle\{(\vec{x}_1, y_1), \dots, (\vec{x}_n, y_n)\} with class labels {\displaystyle y_{i}\in \mathbf {Y} } y_i \in \mathbf{Y}, compute the per-class centroids {\displaystyle \textstyle {\vec {\mu _{l}}}={\frac {1}{|C_{l}|}}{\underset {i\in C_{l}}{\sum }}{\vec {x}}_{i}} \textstyle\vec{\mu_l} = \frac{1}{|C_l|}\underset{i \in C_l}{\sum} \vec{x}_i where {\displaystyle C_{l}} C_{l} is the set of indices of samples belonging to class {\displaystyle l\in \mathbf {Y} } l \in \mathbf{Y}.
Prediction function: the class assigned to an observation {\displaystyle {\vec {x}}} {\vec {x}} is {\displaystyle {\hat {y}}={\arg \min }_{l\in \mathbf {Y} }\|{\vec {\mu }}_{l}-{\vec {x}}\|} \hat{y} = {\arg\min}_{l \in \mathbf{Y}} \|\vec{\mu}_l - \vec{x}\|.
