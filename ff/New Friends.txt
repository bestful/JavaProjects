But he was a very lonely kid. He had few friends and a lot of people didn't like him. He had a hard time in school since he was young. A lot of the kids in school would make fun of him or pick on him for reasons he just didn't know and still doesn't.</p><p>But things have gotten better. He made some friends but the he only got to see them in school or on few occasions.</p><p>But today his life was about to become very strange. We currently find him sitting at home alone watching tv bored out of his mind.</p><p>"Man its so fucking boring around here." he said as his phone began to ring.</p><p>"Hold the fuck up I'm coming dammit. Hello.</p><p>"Guess who."</p><p>"Shane I know its you."</p><p>"Not just him buddy."</p><p>"Hey Montrel whats up."</p><p>"Aw nothin man just chillin playing pokemon on my Nintendo DS."</p><p>"Figures.

I'll see if I can make it. Shane said.</p><p>"Montrel?"</p><p>"I'm not sure myself I have baseball practice this Saturday."</p><p>"Oh well I can't stay I'm getting ready to go outside." Julian said.</p><p><b>In the Naruto world</b></p><p>Naruto Uzumaki was having a great time at his favorite ramen stand chatting away with Ayame. Sitting next to him was his friend Kiba and Akamaru.</p><p>"Hey Naruto?"</p><p>"Huh what is it?"</p><p>"I was wondering if you could help me with something?"</p><p>"Sure Kiba. Anything just name it."</p><p>"Well there's this girl I want to ask out and I just don't have the guts to do it."</p><p>"So girl problems eh."</p><p>"Well just do like what I do with Sakura. Just ask." Naruto said simply.</p><p>"But I can't just ask. What if she says no?" Kiba reaplied.</p><p>"Kiba... I ask Sakura all the time and get rejected but I never give up. Just ask her no matter what you think the answer is."</p><p>"Alright I'll try."</p><p>"By the way who is this girl."</p><p>"I... Its Hinata." Kiba replied with a blush causing Naruto to choke on his ramen.</p><p>"Hi...Hinata!!?"</p><p>"Don't worry I'm pretty sure she'll say yes."</p><p>"Really are you sure?"</p><p>"Yeah."</p><p>"Well I'll go ask her."</p><p>"Alright man. Good luck." Naruto said as Kiba payed for his meal and ran off.</p><p>"Thanks man. I'll see you latter." Kiba shouted over his shoulder.</p><p><b>In the Bleach world.</b></p><p>Ichigo Kurosaki was training with Urahara in the training field under his shop.</p><p>"Hey Ichigo how's about we take a break."</p><p>"Sure why not I'm getting a little tired myself I think I'll hit the hotsprings.</p><p>"Alright but don't stay to long I don't want to find a lobster when I come back."</p><p>"Yeah yeah whatever."</p><p>"Four minutes later."</p><p>"Man these hotsprings are great. You know I should really ask Urahara what's in this water."</p><p>"Hey Ichigo you look pretty relaxed."</p><p>"Gah!!!!!!!" Yoruichi!! When the hell did you get here?!!"</p><p>"I got here just now. Why?"</p><p>"Well you could have at least waited till I got out of the hotsprings."</p><p>"I know but I thought that you being down here all alone would be lonely. So since the water seems so nice I think I'll join you."</p><p>"What!!!? N..n...n....no don't come in please I'm just fine I'm not lonely at all."</p><p>"Aww come on Ichigo loosen up a little. Quit being so stiff and shy it's not like you haven't seen me naked before."</p><p>"But still. Just because you've flashed me a <i>"couple"</i> times doesn't mean you do it every time you see me." Ichigo said looking away.</p><p>"Aww poor poor Ichigo. Are you afraid of me?</p><p>"........"</p><p>"Don't worry. I won't bite.... unless you want me to". Yoruichi whispered huskily as she licked the his cheek which caused him to pass out on the spot.</p><p>"huhuhuh poor Ichigo. He's so innocent." She said as she picked him up put on there clothes and shuppoed them out of the training area.</p><p><b>In the Sonic world</b> (Keepin this one short and fast just like Sonic)</p><p>"Hey Knuckles what up?"</p><p>"Sonic what are you doing here?"</p><p>"Well ya know same old same old. Just traveling the world at Sonic speed and decided to stop in and say hi."</p><p>"SOOONIC."</p><p>" Dammit. Well. Gotta go." And with those words he was off in flash.</p><p>"You can't out run me and my love for you." Shouted Amy as she continued pursute of her one sided love.</p><p><b>In Dragon Ball Z world</b></p><p>Goku was training with Gohan because he's really out of shape.</p><p>"Gohan thats enough for the day." Goku said to his son.</p><p>"Alright dad."</p><p>"Man Gohan your really out of it. I wasn't even trying and your worn out."</p><p>"Well you know with mom on me after the cell games I had to stop training so I lost some skill."</p><p>"Yeah but man what about after we defeated Majin Buu. I mean all of that power couldn't have just disappeared right."</p><p>"Yeah well I'm sure it's still there I just have to get back in my stride and it will come out over time."</p><p>"I hope so. Because remember what I said after the cell game's. If anything happened to me you are the only one who can and has the power to protect earth so I'm going to be training you and Goten a lot more from now on to at least get your powers to where they were before and then we can work on getting your higher power levels back after that ok."</p><p>"Understood father so I take it you want me to take some personal time off to train by myself and get back in shape.</p><p>"Yep you got it. Oh and tell Goten to bring Trunks next time and see if he can't get Trunks into convincing Vegeta into coming."</p><p>"Ok I'll tell him but why do you want Trunks and Vegeta?"</p><p>"Because I want Goten and Trunks to fuse so we can work on there fusion technique. And what better way than to train someone who's fused with someone else who's fused."</p><p>"So your going to train Gotenks as Gogeta huh?"</p><p>"Yep." Well I'm starving lets go see what the girls made. Goku said flying off towards home.</p><p>Chuckling. "Dad never changes." Gohan thought as he watched his dad fly off wheres he followed soon after.</p><p><b>Back in the real world</b></p><p>"Man I've been out here for two hours. It's really no fun when you don't have any friends to do anything with." Julian said to himself as he rode his bike around the duck pond.</p><p>"Well might as well head back since nothing exciting is going to happen."</p><p>10 minutes latter Julian was putting his bike back up when he just had the feeling he wasn't alone. Now he has these feelings a lot and whenever he feels like there's another presence there usually is someone there. But this presence felt... wrong out of place he just couldn't place his finger on it.</p><p>"Someones in my house. It isn't mom because I her car isn't here." He said to himself.</p><p>He cautiously made his way to the door that lead to there kitchen from the garage. As he slowly opened the door he had his right hand reaching for the copy sword of Zangetsu in its shikai form on his back since he never went anywhere without it.</p><p>"Man I am so glad I got this thing." He thought to himself.</p><p>When he finally got the door open and took the first few steps inside he defiantly knew he wasn't alone.</p><p>"Someones defiantly here. HEY I know your there you might as well come out... NOW!!!"</p><p>As he said those words two people came from into the hallway from the back rooms. They were tall and wore masks over there faces but still looked to be in their early twenties and looked like they were strong to. One had a hand gun and a shot gun on his back. The other had a Axe. To say he was scared was an understatement. These guys came fully prepared to kill and were fully armed and all he had was a 52 inch sword.</p><p>"WHO ARE YOU. AND WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE!!!"</p><p>"Whatever we want. Now beat it before I decide to kill ya." The guy with the guns said.</p><p>"Joey why don't we just kill him anyway? We don't want anyone to find out we broke in here. And besides..... the kid doesn't look like much anyway. One shot should do just fine." Said the other.</p><p>"Yeah your right. Sorry kid nothing personal but your going to have to die now." The man now confirmed as Joey said in a non-shallot tone.</p><p>"Da hell I am." Julian said defiantly even though he was scared shitless.</p><p>"Just do it and get it over with so we can leave with the stuff." The other said.</p><p>"Fine Marcus. Damn always rushin somebody." Joey said as he lifted the hand gun and aim it at Julian at the other end of the hall.</p><p>Said boy was so nervous and scared that he couldn't move.</p><p>"Move, move dammit MOVE. He ranted in his mind.</p><p>Out of shear reflex he ducked down low just as the bullet went past his head and dashed into the open garage behind him.</p><p>"Dammit I need to surprise them if I want to win or just stay alive."</p><p>Just as Joey was going to go after him Marcus stopped him.</p><p>"What now? Joey asked</p><p>"Your weapons make to much noise I'll finish him." Marcus said as he went to follow the boy.</p><p>"Fine just hurry back I can't carry all of this stuff by myself."</p><p>Mean while Julian was in the back room catching his breath when he heard the garage door open and close. He curiously looked to find the man with the Axe looking his way as if waiting for him.</p><p>"You can come from back there I know its the only place you can hide."</p><p>"Damn I have to get him in open space if I want to beat this one. Fine I'm coming out. But he didn't come the way Marcus thought he was he came from around the other side which caught him off guard. He went to swing the Axe for the boys head only to find it blocked by a huge ass sword. Julian then pushed his Axe away from him and went for a horizontal slash only to have it blocked. He tried adding pressure but he just wasn't strong enough and got pushed back. He jumped back a few feet as Marcus came at him bringing the Axe strait down. Julian was able to jump to the side at the last minute and used his momentum to push off of the wall and punch Marcus in the face cracking his mask.</p><p>"Damn the kid hits hard but he's just that a kid." And with that thought he charged again swinging his Axe wildly though the air trying to hit the boy. Just as he dodged another hit Julian ducked under the swing and tried to sweep his feet which he dodged. Julian lost his balance trying to get up and stumbled back. Marcus saw this and went to attack and grazed his chest leaving a deep but not too deep cut causing Julian to holler in pain.</p><p>Enough was enough Julian was tired bleeding and angry. So he decided to use a move he saw Hollow Ichigo do on <i>bleach</i>. Marcus watched amused that the kid lasted this long but it was over. Just as he started to stalk forward the kid raised his head and the sword in his hand. What Julian did was he took the cloth of Zangetsu and started spinning it wildly. And swung it straid across hitting Marcus in his arm making him drop the Axe. Happy with his work he quickly yanked the sword back almost cutting his arm clean off and grabbed the sword in his right hand and ran towards him and stabbed strait through his heart killing him instantly.</p><p>"One... down... one to go." Julian panted to himself.</p><p>"Man whats taking him so long. I better go see whats up." Joey said to himself.</p><p>"Hey ugly looking for your friend?" Julian said from the door.</p><p>"What the hell did you do to him?!!!!" Marcus shouted as he saw the fresh blood on the sword and his body.</p><p>"What do you think I killed him. And your next Julian said as he charged right down the hall to the man.</p><p>Said man already had his gun pointed and started to unload seven bullets on him. Some hit some missed but the boy didn't stop and stabbed him in the stomach causing him to cough up blood onto the boy's face.</p><p>Julian was in a world of pain he didn't even think existed. He just got shot four times and it hurt like hell. He knew if he didn't get help soon he would die from blood loss. He raised his right foot and kicked the man off of his sword and fell to his knee's gasping for air. He got up and went to walk away when he heard a voice.</p><p>"H..Hey Kid."</p><p>Julian slowly turned around to find Joey had his gun pointed at him. He raised his sword to block the bullet as it was the only thing he could do as Joey pulled the trigger. The bullet went through the sword almost splitting it in two but leaving a hole with two cracks going up and down. Julian suddenly felt his world becoming black as he looked down to see he had been shot in the heart. He looked up to see Joey with slumped to the ground dead figuring that if he was going he was going to take someone with him.</p><p>"Damn looks like it ends here huh?" Julian thought to himself as he fell face first on the floor never once letting go of his sword. "Looks like I won't be able to make my dream come true.... I'm sorry everyone I love you all." And with that thought his world went black.</p><p>When he woke up he was surrounded by nothing but white. "So this is what death feels like huh. Eh not as bad as I thought."</p><p>"Julian" A young womans voice called.</p><p>He spun around to see a beautiful young woman standing in front of him. "Who.... Who are you?"</p><p>"Who me..... I'm the one you call God."</p><hr><p>There thats chapter one don't worry everyone will be meeting each other soon so don't fret. It is 4:04 on a school morning and I have to be up in an hour so I hope your all happy.</p><p>Please review. Thanks.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;">New Friends</p><p style="text-align:center;">Cross over</p><p style="text-align:center;">Naruto x Bleach x DBZ x Sonic</p><p style="text-align:center;">Chapter two</p><p>Hey everyone I don't know a lot of Japanese so if I use some words wrong let me know but I'm going to try to add a little more Japanese words for the fans. So anyway enjoy.</p><p>To say Julian was surprised was an understatement. In front of him stood a beautiful young woman mid twenties shapely body and she was wearing a all white Kimono with a gold sash that showed off her curves and just enough skin to keep you guessing. She had long brown flowing hair that went past her shoulders to about mid back and beautiful brown eyes that looked like they were looking into the very core of his existence. All in all she was Hot.</p><p>Kami on the other hand was looking at him with a tinge of pink on her cheeks it was the first time someone dared to check her out so she was a little embarrassed and also a little upset with herself for blushing because she being checked out and by a kid no less. So she decided to play with him a little in her own special way.</p><p>Julian was sitting there gaping at the beautiful woman in front of him like a fish out of water until he heard giggling. "How do I look?" Kami asked striking a sexy pose showing off her perfectly luscious D-cup breasts and she got just the reaction she was hoping for...... he passed out.</p><p>10 minutes later. Julian started waking up.</p><p>"Ugh. What happened?"</p><p>"You passed out." Kami said.</p><p>"Who are you?" Julian asked again.</p><p>"This question again. I'm Kami." She responded.</p><p>"Yo.....Your Kami?!" Julian asked completely shocked.</p><p>"Yeah I'm Kami." Kami answered. "Who did you think I was."</p><p>"I don't know I thought I was dreaming. So I take it I'm in heaven then."</p><p>"No. Your not in heaven... Yet anyway. Your more like between worlds right now."</p><p>"So I take it your going to guide me the rest of the way personally or are you here to send me to hell."</p><p>"No and No I'm not here to bring you to heaven but I'm also not here to send you to hell. As a matter of fact why would you even think that last part. If you were going to go to hell we wouldn't be here having this conversation." Kami said.</p><p>"So what are you going to do with me then?"</p><p>Sighing she got up from sitting spot a few feet away from him and walk over to him and sat next to him. "Listen closely what I'm going to do is send you back to earth."</p><p>"Your sending me back to earth? Why? I died." He asked confused.</p><p>"One reason I'm sending you back is because it wasn't your time yet." She said.</p><p>"So I get to see my friends and family again?" Julian asked.</p><p>"Yeah." Kami responded.</p><p>"Sweet!!!" He shouted while jumping up and down. Kami just looked at him and smiled. "Well are you ready to go back?" Kami asked.</p><p>"You bet I am."</p><p>"Well then close your eye's." He did as he was told but he wanted to ask her one last thing. "Hey Kami."</p><p>"Yeah." She responded. "I wanted to know if I could uhhhh..... be able to grant my own wishes." He asked a little nervous.</p><p>Kami could only look at him like he had grown a second head. She has heard a lot of people ask for stuff but they were mostly for things like power or money and she's heard people ask for a wish or two but never has she heard anyone ask if they can grant there own wishes. "Well this is new. Your the first person to request something like that. No one has ever asked to be able to grant there own wishes." She said to him. "Well I will grant you this one request." She said which made him smile. "Thank you Kami-chan. He responded which made her blush again.</p><p>"Alright now close your eyes." she told him which he complied.</p><p>Julian didn't know what was going to happen then he felt something soft pressed against his lips. He opened his eyes to see Kami kissing him. Then he started to feel light headed and could feel himself fading. Kami pulled away a few seconds later and looked at him and smiled with a deep ting of pink on her cheeks. "See you later Ju-kun." Was the last thing he heard her say before his world went black.</p><p><b>Back on earth</b></p><p>"Dammit what the hell was he thinking fighting those two. He should have known this is real life not a movie or a cartoon." Julian's brother said to his mom.</p><p>"I think he knew. But it was self defense." His mom said with tears in her eyes.</p><p>After about an hour of Julian getting shot his mom came home to find cops surrounding her house. When she asked what was going on and officers told her that the found her son shot and called that he was dead. Afterwards they were getting ready to take his body when they noticed he had a slight pulse. No one knows how or why he was still alive but he was immediately rushed to the hospital to the delight of his mom and the rest of his family and friends. Now we find his mom brother and several of his friends in the hospital room two days later.</p><p>"Hey guys I'm going to go home right now. I'll be back later." Julian's friend Shane said to everyone. "Yeah. I think I need to leave for now too." Montrel also said.</p><p>"Alright. Thank you all for coming so suddenly. You guys really are his true friends." his mom said.</p><p>"I think I'll stay a little longer." his other friend Jharrda. But just as the others were about to leave. "uuuggghhh. What happened? I feel as if I've been run through by a bull." Julian said as he slowly sat up to look to check his surroundings. Everyone froze in place and looked at him with wide eyes. "What." he said which made Jharrda very mad yet happy at the same time. "WHAT. You've been shot through the heart been unconsciousness and on the verge of death for nearly three days and all you can say is WHAT!! Do you have any Idea how worried everyone has been about you dumbass!!!" Jharrda shouted.</p><p>"Alright alright I get it everyone missed me you don't have to shout in my face dammit." Julian retorted.</p><p>"I can shout to whoever the hell I want to and right now I want to shout at you for being a fucking idiot. What the Fuck were you thinking trying to fight those two!! Why the hell didn't you run!!!!"</p><p>"I would have run but my body wouldn't let me. After I was almost shot in the head when I first saw them I ran into the garage and hid in the back room but one of the guys knew I was there so I was cornered. So I came out and fought and killed him which was hard. I never thought killing someone would make me feel so bad but it had to be done. After I took care of him I went after the guy with the guns. I just charged right at him when I saw him all I could think at the time was if I don't kill him he'll kill me and my mom when she comes." Julian said.</p><p>"But why didn't run out of the house and call for help." Shane asked this time. "When he shot at me the first time I had to force my body to move and I just ran in the back room. Plus I didn't have my cell phone so I knew I was cornered." Julian responded.</p><p>"But anyway I'm tired so I'm gonna get a nap so if there are no more questions good night." And with that said Julian fell back asleep.</p><p>"Dumbass... worrying all of us like that. But I'm happy he's alive and better. I think I will go home for a while." Montrel said.</p><p><b>Two months later</b></p><p>"So I finally get to leave the hospital?" Julian asked his brother.</p><p>"Yeah you can leave today thats why I'm here." His brother responded.</p><p>Two hours later Julian was at home outside in the field next to his house.</p><p>"Well now is as good a time as ever to try to use the power Kami gave me." He said. "I wish I could get a Mazda RX7." He thought to himself. And just like that a 2002 Mazda RX7 limited edition was in his driveway. "Wow It really works. I guess I can finally meet the people who inspired me. I wish all of the people I like from Naruto, Bleach, Sonic, and DBZ were here."</p><p><b>In DBZ world</b></p><p>Goku was training Goten and Trunks how to utilize their power so they could fight without wearing themselves out quickly, while Gohan was practicing some hand to hand combat with Vegeta(who was winning). Gohan was going all while Vegeta was barely even keeping himself entertained.</p><p>"Come on. You should have been able to hit me by now. What happened to that power you had to defeat cell huh.. or better yet the power you had when you faced Buu. You told me you could beat me, yet you haven't landed a single hit yet." Vegeta taunted.</p><p>"Grrrrr.... watch what you say Vegeta.... You might reget it." He said panting before he fazed out of sight.</p><p>Vegeta just stood there and waited for his attack to come. He deflected the blast that came from behind him that Gohan shot from some random place in the forest. "Come on is that the best you've got." Vegeta taunted again.</p><p>"No." Was the simple reply as Gohan appeared behind an unsuspecting Vegeta and gave him a pretty good hit to the face as Vegeta turned to face him which sent him flying a few feet. Vegeta used his momentum to flip in mid air and went to charge back at him but before he could even react Gohan was on him again and kicked him into the air. Gohan then fazed back in behind him again and was getting ready to deliver the final blow but just as he was getting ready to send Vegeta on a crash course to earth he fazed out of sight just as he was about to hit. "What." Gohan said. "I'm right here." Vegeta said as Gohan turned around to find a energy blast pressed against his chest.</p><p>Vegeta fired the blast sending Gohan into the forest below where he created a good sized crater from the impact. Vegeta was surprised that he was able to make some sort of a comeback but he was still lacking in skill and power but just the fact that he almost lost was a sign that the training was paying off but he wouldn't tell him that he would let him figure it out on his own. So he decided to play it cool.</p><p>Gohan was just picking himself out of the crater when Vegeta landed in front of him. "If this was a real fight you would be dead. Your leaving yourself to open so for the next two weeks were going to work on your defense. Now come on lets find Kakorrot its getting late and I'm getting hungry." Vegeta said as he changed back into his normal state and flew off to find Goku.</p><p>Meanwhile Goku was currently looking for Trunks and Goten who were hiding somewhere in the forest.</p><p>"Come out come out wherever you are." Goku said playfully. But the real test was for them to keep their power levels to the lowest points and then try to sneak attack him while in there Super Sayain forms. Trunks tried first and failed horribly. Goten was next and even though he did a little better he still got beat.</p><p>"Hey Goten."</p><p>"Huh"</p><p>"I have an Idea that might work but you'll have to move fast." Trunks said.</p><p>"Ok whats the plan." Goten responded.</p><p>"What I'm going to do is draw his attention and while he focuses on me you go in for the attack." Trunks stated his plan.</p><p>"I don't know if this plan will work but its the only shot we've got so lets go." Goten said and then they both ran off into the forest.</p><p>Goku was still walking around actually getting pretty bored when he noticed a power signature coming from his left. He looked just in time to dodge the punch from Trunks and then kicked him back into a tree. "I told you that you have to be more discreet with your power level if your going to beat me." Goku said. Trunks just looked up at him and smirked. Goku now catching on turned to get a energy blast from Goten. He didn't think that they would bate him like that but there plan was about to back fire. Just as the blast closed in Goku fazed from sight and the blast ended up hitting an unsuspecting Trunks who was still against the tree. He then fazed in behind Goten and kicked him in the back sending him directly where Trunks was just recovering from the blast.</p><p>"Whoo you almost had me there but you'll have to work hard to beat me. Any way its getting late lets head back home so we can get something to eat."</p><p>Goten and Trunks agreed and followed him back meeting Vegeta and Gohan half way.</p><p>"I think todays training went well don't you think." Goku asked Vegeta.</p><p>"Yeah it went fine." Vegeta responded blandly.</p><p>"Dad Why don't we........" Gohan said before he disappeared.</p><p>"Gohan! Gohan..... Goku said before he disappeared. And not just them soon after Vegeta, Trunks, Goten, Krillen, Android 18, Bulma, Chi Chi, Tien, Chaozu, Yamcha, Puar, Piccolo, Denda, Master Roshi, and Turtle all just disappeared.</p><p>And it wasn't just them. In the Naruto world it was the same thing. Naruto had just finished a mission and was entering the village where he disappeared followed by Sakura, Kakashi, Tsunade, Orochimaru, Sasuke, Kiba, Hinata, Kurenai, Anko, Yuugao, Temari, Gaara, Kankuro, Kabuto, and the Akatsuki just disappeared.</p><p>The same thing happened in the Bleach world and Sonic world. They all just disappeared without a trace. Little did they know they were all about to meet and things would get complicated and hectic real fast.</p><p><b>Back the real world</b></p><p>Julian just stood there looking at everyone who was there.</p><p>"What the hell just happened. And who the hell are all of you" Naruto asked.</p><p>Everyone was thinking the same question and trying to figure out where they were and how they got there.</p><p>"I can answer that question." Julian responded causing everyone to turn and look at him. "Welcome to my realm. It's nice to finally meet you all."</p><p>Well thats chapter two. Sorry about the ending. I know I could have done better with that but Its three in the morning and I have school tomorrow so the last part was kind of rushed.</p><p>Anyway review as always and let me know what I can do to make the story better. Pm me if you have any Idea's for the story I'm always open.</p><p>So Until next time.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;"><B>Update notice! Important!</B></P><P><B>Hello all of my fans! Or former fans. Just wanted to let you all know I haven't forgotten my Naruto fanfics!</B></P><P><B>Actually I've been really hard at work on ALL of them! In fact that's why I haven't updated. </B></P><P><B>I've decided that instead of having everyone wait for each chapter to come out for god knows when that I should just finish as much of each story as I can and then do one MASSIVE update when I'm done or close to done. I'm taking about a two week break from typing right now to give myself and my brain a break.</B></P><P><B>So people it may be a long while before you see an update on any of my Naruto fics but don't fret because they are being worked on. I may remove the fics to re-do the main chapters and focus on uploading the Gundam fanfic whilst I work on the others. </B></P><P><B>Also been on kind of a Gundam and Bleach binge lately so I've been a little distracted from my Naruto work. And to top it off I've been having this crazy Idea roaming in my mind for a while now and I might make either a full on story later... if it doesn't eat away at me first.</B></P><P><B>And that is a Gundam Wing x Gundam 00 x Strike Witches Crossover. Or a massive one-shot comedy with Bleach x Sekirei x Rosario Vampire x Elfen Lied x High school DxD! Massive yes but god the amounts of Troll I'm gonna put Ichigo through would be worth the headache!</B></P><P>…<B>... Ya know what Fuck it! That's my weekend goal! (Next to watching Formula Drift, NASCAR and hoping I qualify for a drift comp on GT5!) Make this rofl one-shot and get it over with so I can focus on my Naruto shit! </B></P><P><B>Also side thought. I'm really surprised no one has done a Bleach x </B><B>Hyakka Ryōran: Samurai Girls crossover yet? I mean yeah sure its pretty much another version of Sekirei but still! It has so much potential from what I've seen! Ichigo meeting Jubei!? What!? Oh man not only will there be massive trolling by his hollow and her but there would be so much ass kicking! </B></P><P><B>Or even a Bleach x Freezing crossover? Ichigo there would just be... sigh... serious OP'ed women if he got there. And if you haven't noticed YES I'm a massive Ichigo fan. Not to the extent of being a complete utter fanboy but a massive fan none the less.</B></P><P><B>I mean he's one of those characters where as long as you don't fuck his personallity in the ass you can put him into pretty much any other anime with or without his shinigami powers and he would blend in and it not be akward. Elfen Lied, Murder Princess, Soul Eater, Fairy Tale, Shakugan no Shana you name it. As long as he keeps his same brash, rough, stubborn yet caring and kind personality you'll see he'll fit in almost anything. Lol... its sad but true.</B></P><P><B>Anyway I've ranted long enough. Its... HOLY FUCKING SHIT ITS 5:17 A.M! </B></P><P><B>I'm out Later people! </B></P>
