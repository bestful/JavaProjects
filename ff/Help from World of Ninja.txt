In the last attack we lost many people, and now we can't even found it. They are using some kind of magic to hide it from us. Everything we tried rejected from protection they are using."</P><P>" Have you noticed that the last attack used more firepower? Those are werewolf! They can tear up all lookups and are resistant to most magical attacks, but so much firepower did not have. A couple of their friends were young wizards, how do they got so much power?"</P><P>"Your own inability to win a couple old dogs repliest some miracle. Lord Voldemort will be dissatisfied. Werewolves must join or perish."</P><P>"If you have finished arque listen to my next plan…"</P><P>Quiet rustling of poor heard in remote corner of darkness beneath the old forest.

But they put an spell of silence, I could not hear what saved us a new abomination."</P><P>"You know Krustal,"said Naruto" I think this time will be in terms of a scam or a trap for open attack fail."</P><P>"You are right Naruto" Harry added" is likely to try to send someone in village. Pay attention to all foreigners who will come in, Krustal you know the villagers, if anyone of them is different sent a sigh immediately. Because if anyone of them is under the spell, he will betray us against his will."</P><P>"Harry, it is difficult to enchant werewolves, we're resistant to magic."</P><P>"Yes Krustal, it is difficult but not impossible.

A wave of dark wizards was going to flood the village.</P><P>From Naruto's hands are flashing lightning, but the enemy are to much. Somewhere behind him he heard a painful cry of old werewolf and he knew without checking that the old men is lost. He flew through black wave and burned all on his way but the dark wizards were also good fighters and on his body, regardless of speed and power was already wounds and burns. He broke the big black ball and took out another werewolf cruelly wounded and injured and pushed him into a ditch, there was no time to help him.</P><P>With the start of waves found at the end and followed them to destroy as much as possible.</P><P>The attack was launched and from the other side.

Huge brown werewolf fought for her home and all her enemies were as red small spots that attracts and further upset her. When enemies are tired, she left company of defenders and hastily ran to village.</P><P>A group of enemies who have broken trough attacked the old little lady who has been luring them into a big circus tent-stalls. Who entered no more left, and soon tent=stalls full of enemies exploded.</P><P>"Grandma" screamed Crystal, ready to thrown herself in to the fire to save her last family member.</P><P>"Hey little one calm down, I have more tricks in my sleeve," she heard a cheerful voice of her granny.</P><P>"We were good right now, isn't it?".</P><P>"Ah Grandma how you scared me".</P><P>Old werewolves scattered enemies, and grandmother organized assistance to the injured and burial of those who unfortunately fell in struggle for survival.</P><P>Deep in a night where everything is cleaned, grandmother has issued command to gather all their stuff to leave a village and move somewhere their enemy won't find them and won't recognize them.</P><P>"But granny", Naruto objected,"We broke them, there won't come back soon…"</P><P>"Oh my son, but now they know where we never would be safe.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>Old abandoned square in a modest seaside town. Two of three old men walking uncertain and worried looks a little worried and went into the dilapidated inn.</P><P>On the roof square and the old men carefully watched two pairs of eyes hidden under the shadows of old town.</P><P>"Crystal, this pace will not get any until tomorrow."</P><P>"I know,Kyuubi,I know, but they are old, they left all of their life and with nothing left for unknown. That's terrible for them."</P><P>"Oh I understand, Good to be careful, no one follows them."</P><P>"Do not worry, the animal instinct in them are very strong. They are really wary."</P><P>"You're right, but they seems so sad. Any careful observer will notice that something is wrong."</P><P>"That is something we cannot change. There are two more groups and they are happy to arrive. I hope that guys are doing well for further transport."</P><P>While girls are whispering and guarding on the roof, in the inn is led gall but also quiet discussion.</P><P>"Order of the Phoenix has provided shelter for every member of the lost village, and this idea of yours…"</P><P>"Lupin,look at things from their point of view", Harry hisses,"They are old and have spent their lives that are much longer then your of their children are dead or missing and you would now separate them and send each of them to the other end of the you any heart?"</P><P>"I have not thought about it so I think that you are right, but I worry how many of them will be exposed of darkness are everywhere."</P><P>"That's why we checked fishing hunt community,"added Naruto."They are willing to accept these lively elders to work on ships, and old women will be organized with fishing hunt are plenty of old sailors and number of old people will not be so how is your coperation with them?"</P><P>"They are are so powerful and reasonable that I don't understand how people calls us with same name. When I transform I do not know myself, but for them there is no difference whether they are people or wolves they are same person. I don't understand that. I will come more often to learn about them, to learn how to control myself."</P><P>The next day, the fishing fleet sailed into the hunt , reinforced the old sea wolves.</P><P>Loose pickup coughing on road left for manorial property at the end of old town. It was drove by old loose man accompanied by his old wife. These are masked Naruto and Kyuubi who decided to take advantage of their ninja warriors abilities to explore property holding a suspicion that there are supporters of darkness. The mask is perfect no one would suspect with magic or not that these two are the most powerful warriors on the planet.</P><P>Pickup parked in front of the main house and the guards are already running to expel old intruder away. Naruto is widely argued as a real peevish old man, that he and his dear invited to take a load of apples. Guardians are awkwardly trying to catch the old man with cane dancing skillfully evaded between them. At one point the old man screamed:</P><P>"MY DEAR , what have you done with her heartless sons of mothers even worse!"</P><P>Old woman were nowhere.</P><P>The guards provided by the crazy sprint on property. They run in and out from the large house, entered the auxiliary facilities, barns and sheds, an old woman was nowhere. Strange old man screamed and jumped for them, so the noise was terrible.</P><P>Owner of property got out to see what kind of crowd and noise. Somehow he managed to calm down desperate old man and called him in a kitchen for a cup of tea. In the kitchen they found a lost old woman sipping tea with cook's assistant. Happiness was not an end for an old man, who wept and cuddled his sweetheart that was probably deaf when she did not react with whole noise.</P><P>Boss shook a small assistant and he said he found the grandmother cowering in the corner of the kitchen while everyone shouted and ran somewhere, he took pity on her and cook her tea.</P><P>Granny was found and resolved the question of apples, old couple are invited to another property with similar names. The old pickup was coughing hard to get through the main gate and headed to an unknown destination.</P><P>In that moment as if volcano started working under the main building. Basement disappeared in fire and entire part collapsed. Confused guards did not know what befallen them, and the boss is powerless gnashing his teeth.</P><P>In truck the old woman spoke with young Kyuubi's voice:</P><P>"You know Naruto you were right. Below is a laboratory building and were moved much away from research. Their new weapon would destroy our friends very fast. But the records are gone, and memories of lost lab-men, lab flew into the air."</P><P>"Never doubted in you my dear. But do you know what Crystal's granny cook?"</P>

We start now to not give them a time to kill her"</P><P>"You child lead and I will listen…to not jeopardize action with my impatience"</P><P>Kyuubi made a demonic vortex, and she and grandma were gone in a instant.

However a carefull observer would noticed that they are watching the enviroment and four young group.</P><P>Discussion at table ran fast as train,the main word was leading a long-haired brunette noticeable pale:</P><P>"I had enough. You all act as if I am made of glass. Naruto healed all my injures and I am ready for action. What do we know about enemy?"</P><P>"Crystal" Kyuubi tried to reduce tension:</P><P>"Just because you are healed, does not mean you are just fine. You are still very pale and you need time to recover strenght. Magic healed you quickly, but your body still needs time to be completely cured."</P><P>"I hate this. I am surrounded by support group and you won't let me do anything. I am going to be crazy!"</P><P>"You know girls I have a great idea!" Naruto says:" Do you want to go fishing in the afternoon cruise. We are going to help the fishermen, you can sunbate, make a sandwich…We will spend the night at the sea, a good opportunity to recharge our batteries a bit and not to fall into trouble."</P><P>"Shall we" Harry's eyes cheerfully shine on"I would like to one day be an ordinary young man who spends a romantic evening on the boat with his girlfriend…"</P><P>"True romance Harry" Kyuubi started to giggle"Fish everywhere, intestines burst. Sea wolves yelling at us to get away so they can work, nothing more beatuful…"</P><P>"Kyuubi you know what I mean, and it not so bad, we need a little peace, and I know that I am right."</P><P>"Al right, all right" and Crystal started to laugh and looking forward to travel.</P><P>In the afternoon, an old fishermen threw the last boxes on old sailling and four young people is rapidly loaded baskets,bags,umbrellas,parcels, enough to fill a larger van.</P><P>After good running on the desk and cabins, they are finally ready to sail. Evening fell, fishermen cast their nets, and the passengers are safely seated and sipping their drink, when something attracted Naruto's attention. High sea wave aproached the boat, maybe Naruto would not even notice it on his top if it not for sinister sparkled,white foam.</P><P>"Hey guys, I am afraid that trouble is coming. I see a tall wave that is strangely moving."</P><P>"Oh no, not again…"</P><P>"We wanted only a peacefull evening…"</P><P>Complaining is starting.</P><P>After initial grumbling Harry got serios:</P><P>"This is not good! Turn the ship, cut the net, will sink us!"</P><P>"Cut nets…am I demon or not, I already got them cut off…"Naruto muttered:</P><P>"Kyuubi, magic of great wind,make a tunnel to make a bout go through it, and you magic boy make a magic to brake the wave down for if the wave get to the port city it will flood it down and kill everyone in it."</P><P>Kyuubi struggled with all force to command wind and save the ship and Harry quickly made a magic spell to break the waves.</P><P>"It's spellbound, I cannot do anything to stop it"yelped Harry.</P><P>"Come on Harry, I will help you with my magic" hurried Naruto.</P><P>Combined forces of two young boys malicious wave is defeated.</P><P>"A nice evening at sea" Crystal sarcastically remarks."What's next..killer whales, the great Kraken…"</P><P>"Don't summon" Naruto yelled and threw a big lightning bolt on started a big battle with huge octopus.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P>After midnight someone knocked discreetly at the cabin door of Crystal and Kyuubi. The girls were sleepy and fuzzy opened the door and looked at the old and wrinkled face of old captain.</P><P>"Come on,ladies,wake up. We arrived at destination"</P><P>"What destination, captain?" the girls watched him confused,but the old man had already dissapeared like ghost.</P><P>"What is this all about" the girls asked, but were quickly prepared and came out on desk.</P><P>The scene was more than confusing and strange. The ship was moored in small lagoon. It was for the discrite flashes of distant stars. No noises were heard, not even the creaking of old sails, and yet they noticed a small boat that passes quickly from ship to shore and back.</P><P>The old captain quickly finger over lisp showed them to be quiet, put them in boat and sent them ashore. The boat arrived and showed them the path carved into the rock to the hidden cave.</P><P>Slowly they aproached the dark entrance, where Naruto and Harry are awaiting them. Silence was obviously very important and they all came in, pushing through the barrier that was slowly letting them in. They reached the group of people who were expecting them illuminated with just fisher's lamp.</P><P>It was a group of the Order of the Phoenix who with smiles greeted brave foursome.</P><P>"Ah here's our heroes" the voices were heard…" You defeated death eaters again"…</P><P>But old professor looked at them anxiously, in his eyes there was a lot of sadness in his words just a little encouragement:</P><P>"This meeting was organized in deep secret. Everyone knows that in our ranks there is a mole and that it's activities are mainly related to the four of you. You are definitely a thorn in the side of our enemies, with the fact on you all the harder,more frequent and stronger. I am not happy to admit it but it's true. By now you've had a lot of luck, but now you have your actions and your time to carefully manage. I have a lot to tell you about our enemy and the ways to destroy him. Let others say their own and then I will"…</P><P>Merry witch, whose hair is constantly changing color began to talk so fast that her words are assimilated into one another:</P><P>"Listen to me now now your movement must carefully hide. Even in circle of your loved ones tell one plan and do something completely unexpected. Then use informal methods for as a mugles. Often change the shape and organization of groups, two pairs are quite noticeable, but with a little masquerade it will be three girls in company with theirs mothers, four boys on the trip. Imagine different combinations so that yours enemies won't notice you that easily."</P><P>"Like we are careless children" muttered Naruto.</P><P>"You are not careless, but you survived a few times due to pure luck and the fact that you have been underestimated. It will not happen anymore. They consider you a serious opponents. And they hired a large and powerful forces to stop you."</P><P>"This is not a criticism" said the sad young werewolf" This is serious concern for your safety. A large,dark forces are moving and you are our best hope in this war. Survive to be able to win."</P><P>"Oh, yes…the reason why we invited you…our research has found out that the enemy has created more horcruxes and that is why he is almost invicible. Horcrux is made when a person separetes a part of his soul and stores it in some object. This magic is powerful and very dark. Explore his life and find out where he could hide his horcruxes.

Waves furiosly beat in small bay,rock like dark teeth of sea monster potruding from powerful foam of waves chased by storm. On the ledge is squeezing four wet silhouettes and were shouting with noise storms.</P><P>"Here is the place I am sure"</P><P>"If it is here then how to open it? should we sacrifice you or something like that?"</P><P>"Do not be so dramatic, I have everything planned."</P><P>"Yes of course, only that we don't get drowned."</P><P>"You're irrational, it's just a little water, and the place is here I am sure and start casting spells already so that we can enter inside and I too am fed with this storm. You don't have to sacrifice me at least not at first obstacle."</P><P>"You're crazy, I can't hear myself let alone casting some spells."</P><P>"Will you two stop already. Open up that damned cave so that we can enter. You will have inside plenty of opportunities to sacrifice each other if I don't dismembered both of you before that."</P><P>It all started one month before when they discovered a collector who collect school things of the Dark lord. Examination of collected material, they found the information in one fascicule that he was fascinated by the wonders of ancient worlds, and wondered if they really all gone.</P><P>Complicated demonic ritual Kyuubi has learned that part of the statue of Artemis' temple was saved from flames and taken away in a remote cave in the Mediterranean sea. But the cave was full of ancient traps and dark magic.</P><P>Naruto was for frontal access and dragged them to the cave for the largest storm that was raging as if he personally ordered. The rest of team did not liked this but they started to conquer the dark secrets.</P><P>Even now they grumble at the edge of cliff at risk to fall in wild sea. After more grumbling appeared narrow portal, and they have finally entered the cave.</P><P>"Hold! Don't move, let's see what is all here hidden…"</P><P>"Whatever is hidden, this place is old, I feel old traps from another time…"</P><P>"All this is certanly true, but here there are so many dark magic that simply choke everything around itself…"</P><P>"Enough talk, on the business guys."</P><P>From Kyuubi's hands started fly small glowing balls and soon the huge cave was completely lit on or not…Through all cave stretched the dark shadow that hides the view.</P><P>"What do you say, isn't it magical? Just look at all this archaic treasure at the other end. Wow I can't see all because of this fog, but I think that there are some things that were long forgotten and…"</P><P>"Oh Naruto don't be so delighted, start to destroy traps."</P><P>"Traps I will easily break up, they are work of human hands, it must first be dispersed this dark force. Come on wizards forward with full force."</P><P>Set off multitude of spells, anti-spells of good and light magic which is slowly tearing apart dark and evil which was made by Dark lord.</P><P>After several hours and more of fierce fighting the cave finally shone with warm and peaceful light. The evil is driven away.</P><P>"Bravo children, now is my turn…" Naruto was delighted.</P><P>"See those holes up at the top, there is a so-called rolling stones, one wrong step and it will fall on our heads, they can be stopped by levitation but one of us would be exhausted doing that so…" from Naruto's hands flew flames and the holes are permanently sealed.</P><P>"That was one problem, take a look now at floor in front of us…"</P><P>The cave had a shiny floor with dark blocks here and there, on the other end of the cave there was a podium and many ancient treasures were on it.</P><P>"This is not the floor, it's a lake of gelatinous mass, which is ten times fiercer than the strongest acid, if you mistakenly step on the stones we will all sink in and…"</P><P>"Naruto you're really in the mood for teaching…" Kyuubi laughed, and clapped her small hands and from them flowed air that freezes the entire surface including stones.</P><P>"Hey since when you use the magical ice?" Naruto is surprised,</P><P>"Always dear I just got the chance to use it now."</P><P>Soon they have deactivated all the traps and approached the podium. And now came the problem, where is horcrux among all those stuff.</P><P>"Harry look at that beautiful crown. I think this is the crown of the statue of Artemis." Crystal pointed at one of the crowns on separated huge box.</P><P>"Don't move and don't touch it…"cried Harry" This is a job for our hopeful demon".</P><P>Naruto focused a strong beam of demonic fire and crown began to melt. Horcrux trapped in it started to scream and die.</P><P>"It's done, and now let's run as soon as possible, I doubt that that he didn't felt this."</P><P>Running they have activated traps and on exit of the cave quickly transported.</P><P>Harry noticed at corner of his eye while leaving a huge number of dark wizards coming, but our heroes are already gone.</P><P>On small terrace fisherman's taverns four young people were drinking and happily talking.</P><P>"First is finished, move on"</P><P>Naruto and Kyuubi in next adventures.</P>
