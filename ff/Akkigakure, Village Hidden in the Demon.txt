Village Hidden in the Demon</P><P>Naruto
was walking towards the Hokage Office to see what Tsunade wanted when
he noticed some of the villagers who hated him smile at him. He was
shocked at this, but ignored it until he got to the Hokage Office. He
walked in and saw Shizune, he noticed she was sad, but he ignored it
and walked in only to see Tsunade had tears going down her face. "
Um baachan what did you want to see me ab..." he was cut off by
being grabbed into a hug. " Um is something the matter?" he
asked. Tsunade let go of him and said," Sorry Naruto, but as of
today you are exiled from the village of Konohagakure as sentenced by
the Council."</P><P>Naruto
was shocked. After everything he did for them he gets exiled. "
Fine then this is goodbye Hokage-sama," he said as he walked off
without realizing that Tsunade was crying again. As he walked out of
the building he noticed some of the civilian council smirking at him,
but a stupid one came up to him and said," Ha finally goodbye
demon br-" but was cut off by a kunai getting lodged into his
neck. " Heh see you you peices of crap," said Naruto as he
walked off to his apartment to get his stuff packed up so he can
leave.</P><P><I>10
minutes later</I></P><P>Naruto
was at the gate of Konoha and saw that no one came to see him off
making him angrier <I>( I
forgot to say he's 13). </I>Naruto
left and headed through Konoha's Forest trying to find a place to
stay for the night when he was suddenly pulled into his mind by
Kyuubi.</P><P><B>Naruto's
Mindscape</B></P><P>"
What do you want fuzzball. My life is already ruined enough," he
said.</P><P><B>"
Listen Kit I know you are mad, but I know a jutsu that can help you
out," </B>said
Kyuubi</P><P>"
Why should I believe you?" asked Naruto.</P><P><B>"
Because Kit even if you don't believe me I do care for you so just
listen to me if you want a place to stay,"</B>
said Kyuubi.</P><P>"
Fine now what do I do?" he asked.</P><P><B>"
Well are you in the middle of the Land of Fire and Land of Wind
border?" </B>asked
Kyuubi.</P><P>"
Yes I am," he said.</P><P><B>"
Okay now I want you to draw a huge circle a few miles long and wide,
but make sure half of it is on Land of Fire and the other half is on
Land of Wind. Now when you are done tell me so I can tell you what to
do next," </B>said
Kyuubi.</P><P>"
Okay Kyuubi," Naruto said with a small smile on his face.</P><P><B>Real
World</B></P><P>Naruto
left his mindscape and grabbed a marker he had in his bag and started
drawing a large circle like Kyuubi said around the border and put in
some jagged edges just for fun and when he got to as far as he was
going for the circle he saw something in the air. <I>"
Um Kyuubi what is that thing in the air?" he asked in his mind.
</I><I><B>"That is
the portal into the Demon Realm kit now just keep on drawing the
circle," </B></I>said
Kyuubi. <I>" But
Kyuubi whatever you are thinking is it going to have anything to do
with the portal?" he asked </I><I><B>"Yes
it has to do, but only because it will strengthen my power meaning
that you can use more of it to power what I'm having you do,"
</B></I>said Kyuubi. <I>"
Fine Kyuubi, but if something bad happens I'm going to do something
bad to myself threatening my life," </I>said
Naruto. <I><B>"
Don't worry Kit I'm not planning anything,"</B></I>
said Kyuubi.</P><P>Naruto
kept on drawing the circle around until he got back to where he
started it. " Okay I'm done with the circle what do I do now
Kyuubi?" asked Naruto. <I><B>"
Okay now start channeling my chakra through your body into the circle
and say ' Tsuchi Ichuu no Jutsu" </B></I>said
Kyuubi. " Ok Kyuubi." Naruto started channeling Kyuubi's
chakra into the ground and said," Tsuchi Ichuu no Jutsu,"
nothing happened. " Um Kyuubi nothing happened," said
Naruto. <I><B>" Kit
move your hands upwards and say Go up 1,000 ft." </B></I>said
Kyuubi. " Okay um Go up 1,000 ft." as soon as he said that
the piece of land went up as high as he said.</P><P>"
Okay now what?" he asked. <I><B>"
Okay now get one of the scrolls and make a seal then channel as much
chakra as you did into the seal as you did into the jutsu,"</B></I>
said Kyuubi. " Okay, but I was wondering how the heck do I get
up there?!" he yelled/asked. <I><B>"
Just make the seal first okay,"</B></I>
Kyuubi said. " Fine," he said as he grabbed a scroll and
started making the seal into it. After he finished that he channeled
Kyuubi's chakra into it until he felt Kyuubi's chakra completely fill
the seal. " Okay now what?" he asked. <I><B>"
Okay now I want you to charge</B></I><I><B>up</B></I><I><B>as much chakra
as you can into your feet and keep doing it until you feel you have
enough to make a huge wall then jump as high as you can and the
chakra you have at your feet will let you fly up to the land,"</B></I>said Kyuubi. "
Okay," he said kinda not believing what he's hearing.</P><P>Naruto
started charging chakra into his feet and after about 5 minutes he
jumped into the air and and expected to fall, but saw that he wasn't
so he started flying up towards the huge piece of land. After a few
minutes of flying he landed on the piece of land and was amazed that
he was able to fly. " Okay now Kyuubi it is almost dark and I
want to know where am I suppose to sleep?" he asked. <I><B>"
Okay kit come in here because I want to show you something,"</B></I>
said Kyuubi. " Okay," he said as he pushed himself into his
mindscape.</P><P><I><B>Naruto's
Mindscape</B></I></P><P><B>"
Okay now kit I'm going to show you some jutsus that I use and also
I'm going to tell you about all of the different affinities,"</B>
said Kyuubi.</P><P>"
Okay, but I know all of them, Fire, Lightning, Water, Wind, and
Earth," he said.</P><P><I><B>"
Yes, but there are advanced forms of them by using some of the
elements at the same time like ice which was used by Haku..." </B></I>
started Kyuubi only to bestopped by seeing Naruto's sad face. Kyuubi
knew that Naruto had loved Haku and since she was killed by Kakashi
even mentioning her name makes him sad. Also Naruto has always had a
hatred of Kakashi inside of him. <I><B>"
I'm sorry Kit I forgot, but seriously we need you to learn these.
Okay now everyone might think the Wood nature is only able to be used
by the 1st Hokage well actually it's just a fusion of using Earth and
Water at the same time. Also Lava is a... </B></I>"
Let me guess a fusion of using Earth and Fire at the same time,"
said Naruto. <I><B>"
Yes that's right. Now the Third Kazekage had a special magnetic
chakra unique to him, but in actuality he is just using lightning and
earth at the same time, now the next is about Gaara's sand
manipulation. He is actually using the wind and earth elements
simultanously." </B></I>Kyuubi
finished the explanation.</P><P>"
Okay now why are you telling me all of this?" he asked. <I><B>"
Because kit you have the ability to use all of the affinities. Now
after I teach you all the jutsus I know of each affinity I want you
to learn on how to fuse them together and learn jutsus of each
advanced form okay,"</B></I>
said Kyuubi. " Okay, but I want to know why are you helping me?"
asked Naruto. <I><B>"
Because kit I have seen your life and what those people have done to
you just because I am sealed inside of you and I want to help as much
as I can," </B></I>said
Kyuubi." Thanks Kyuubi oh yeah do you have a human form?"
he asked. <I><B>"
Yes I do I'll change into it," </B></I>said
Kyuubi in an angelic voice.</P><P>Naruto
saw smoke surround Kyuubi and in place of the giant fox was a woman
looking to be around 27. She had black hair with some red streaks of
red hair going down them, she had red eyes, whiskers on each side of
her face, she had on a tank top that hugged at her high DD breasts
and her curves, some blacks pants, and some ninja sandals. "
Beautiful," he said not realizing that he said that out loud.
With a faint blush and a seductive smile on her face she said,"
Like what you see?" asked Kyuubi. " U-U-Um maybe," he
said with a huge blush on his face.</P><P>"
Hehe well lets sta... what the," she said. " Hm what's
wrong?" asked Naruto. " It seems something is wrong with
the seal. I guess it has something to do with using so much of my
chakra it seems something is about to happen," she said. "
Okay what's going to-OW!!!!!" he yelled as he fll to the floor
in pain. Kyuubi looked at Naruto and remembering his childhood
suddenly made her want to go and comfort him, but the bars were in
the way. She suddenly had tears in her eyes and was about to cry when
she saw the bars go away. She quickly ran over to him and embraced
him in a warm hug, resting his head on her breasts.</P><P><I><B>Real
World</B></I></P><P>Naruto's
body was surrounded in lightning and was then surrounded in Kyuubi's
chakra only to go away as soon as it came and Kyuubi appeared
unconscious holding Naruto in a warm hug and a smile on her face as
night over took.</P><P><I>The
Morning</I></P><P>Naruto
was the first to wake up in the morning and immediantly noticed that
his head was somewhere wam and soft. He looked up and saw Kyuubi's
nice smiling face and immediantly knew where he was. He tried to get
out of her grip, but found that she was holding him in a strong yet
nice hug almost as if she was protecting him. He just lied there
waiting for her to wake up while noticing that he felt happy in this
hug and that his heart was beating faster <B>(
A/N He's not in love with her he's just happy)</B><I><B>.</B></I>
About 30 minutes later Kyuubi woke up and noticed the way she was
holding Naruto and also noticed that he was now awake. " Uh
sorry," she said with a blush on her face. " D-D-Don't be
it was actually nice," he said with a blush that rivaled
Hinata's then he realized what he said and thought, "<I>Crap
that was stupid to say stupid, stupid, stupid,"</I>.</P><P>"
Uh t-th-thanks," she said her blush now larger than before. "
So uh lets start training now what do you know?" asked Kyuubi. "
Um shouldn't you know since you were in my mind?" asked Naruto.
" Well I only looked once and awhile so I don't know much about
what you were taught or learnt yourself so tell me," she said. "
Kawarimi no Jutsu, Henge, Kage Bunshin no Jutsu, Kuchiyose no Jutsu,
Rasengan, and Tsuchi Ichuu no Jutsu," he said.</P><P>"
Is that all okay that's it I'm going to teach you some better jutsus,
but first I'm going to teach how to better your chakra so go to the
tree," she said. " Okay," he said walking to a tree. "
Now go up it like you would normally," she said. Naruto put
chakra in his feet and walked up the tree. " Now jump and use
that flying technique I should you," she said. Naruto charged
more chakra into his feet and jumped off the tree only to be
suspended in air. " Now what?"" he asked. " Okay
I want to see how long you can stay in the air," she said. "
Okay, but won't I fall?" he asked. " Yes, but I'll catch
you," she said. " Okay," he said. After about 20
minutes Naruto felt himself lose control over the chakra and start to
fall, " Kyuubi help I can't move," he said falling. He was
about to hit the ground when he felt himself being caught. "
Don't worry I got you," she said. When Naruto tried to say thank
you it only came out as " Thrgk Ygu," Kyuubi looked down
and laughed seeing that he couldn't talk because her breasts were
covering his mouth.</P><P>"
Haha okay now after some rest you are going to do it again," she
said. " Okay, but can I ask you a question?" he asked. "
Sure what do you want to know?" she asked. " Okay I was
wondering why do you stay here with me you're free you can leave,"
he said. " No I can't see I'm free, but it seems that if I don't
stay close to you I will be in immense pain and so will you, see look
at your neck," she said. Naruto pulled down the collar of his
shirt and saw a red kitsune tail tattoo go completely around his
neck. " Cool," he said. " Yeah now lets get to
training, but lets train in your mind for now see time moves
differently there so lets go.</P><P><I>3
Months Later (NM)</I></P><P>"
Okay so how much time has passed in the outside world?" asked
Naruto. " About 3 hrs. so now that you have mastered all of the
Chakra controling excercises and some basic elements jutsus from each
elements and learnt how to use the Mokuton it's time to make the
village," she said. " How I only know how to make a small
forest I don't know how to make a whole village," he said. "
Don't worry I'll help by giving you some of my chakra now lets go to
the real world and make the village.</P><P>A/N

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>I dont own Naruto</P><P>Chapter 2</P><P>Naruto opened his eyes and saw he was staring at the sky. " Must have fallen backwards while I was in my mind," he mumbled to himself before hearing a groan. He looked over and saw that Kyuubi did the same thing he did while they were in his mind. Kyuubi looked over at him as she sat up and said," Okay lets make the village." Naruto nodded as he sat up and walked to the middle of the piece of land.</P><P>Kyuubi walked up to him and gave him about one tail of her chakra for him to use, but only for this jutsu, she gets it back afterwards. " Okay kit concentrate and summon your chakra," Naruto instantly did that thanks to the training," now fuse my chakra into your chakra." Naruto nodded as he started to fuse her chakra with his. " Okay, kit you know the jutsu to do this and, as you said, you were only able to make a small forest with it, but with my chakra you should be able to make a village," she told him.<p>Naruto nodded and got ready to use the jutsu when he realized something. " What the hell! A village isn't the same thing as a forest. How can I make a village using a jutsu that makes forests?" he yelled angrily. Kyuubi sighed as she said," Kit, if you havent noticed, 3/4 of all the buildings in most villages are made of wood. So, using this jutsu, you can create a village with the wood from the trees." Naruto nodded his head in understanding as he was about to start again, when he noticed something else. " Wait, how can I create a village using wood from trees and be done with it in a short amout of time, like you said I would?"</P><P>Kyuubi sighed yet again. <I>" Wow, he really is dense. I thought he would at least become a litte smarter after all the training...guess I was wrong," </I>Kyuubi thought to herself. " Kit you can do Taju Kage Bunshin no Jutsu. You can create the village in a few weeks. Now do the jutsu!" Kyuubi ordered him. Naruto nodded and made the handsigns. " Mori Sozo no Jutsu! (Forest Creation Jutsu)" Naruto yelled as a huge village that covered 3/4 of the piece of land shot put of the ground. Naruto and Kyuubi jumped out of the way as trees shot out under them.</P><P>Finally, the forest stopped growing and Naruto and Kyuubi smirked. " Good job kit, now you know what to do next," Kyuubi said. Naruto nodded and put his hands in his trademark handsign," Taju Kage Bunshin no Jutsu!" 100s maybe thousands of clones appeared. " Now hurry up. We have a village to make!" Naruto yelled happily as his clones, as well as himself, ran off to start cutting down the trees to make the buildings. Kyuubi leaned against a tree, smiling as she watched Naruto having fun, running around with his clones, building the village.</P><P><I>4 weeks later</I></P><P>Naruto smiled as he saw the village that his clones and himself have finally finished. The village was slightly based on Konoha, but it was much smaller because they do not have enough land to make it as large. The village had no huge houses or mansions, all were about the same size so, if they get any villagers, no one would feel lesser than the other. The village was split in half, but not physically. There was a large sign in the middle that says<I>," Ninja side (arrow to the left). Villager side (arrow to the right)."</I> Ninjas and villagers could go into the opposite sides, but they can't live on the others' side like villagers can't live on ninja's side and vice versa. When an academy student who started as a villager becomes a ninja they can live on the villager's side until they have enough money to buy a house on the ninja's side.</P><P>The ninja side was closer to the front gate and the left side of the village so, if any enemies attack, the ninjas can instantly fight back. There was also a large stadium in the middle of the village so, if any events were to be held in this village they had a place to hold the events. An academy was built on the villager's side, but close to the ninja's side as well. Naruto was most happy about the last special building. It is a tower twice as large as the Hokage Tower, but it is for the Akkikage, the Demon Shadow.</P><P>" I cant believe it. I am finally a kage. I wanted to be the Hokage, but I am happy with being the Kage of my new village, Akkigakure," Naruto said to himself with tears in his eyes as he stood on top of the front gate, looking at his village. He jumped off of it and headed to the Akkikage Tower.</P><P>On his way to it, he saw Kyuubi leaning on one of the buildings' walls. " Hey Kyuu-chan," Naruto said happily. Kyuubi smiled as she walked over to him and patted him on the head. " Good job on making the village," she said with a smirk. Naruto stood there with an annoyed look before swatting her hand away. " Stop patting my head! You know I hate it when you do that, hmph," Naruto said as he looked away with an angry face.</P><P>Kyuubi smiled as she heard this before saying to Naruto, " Okay kit, as you know, we are on a piece of land that is floating in the sky," Naruto nodded his head, " Well if we want villagers, we need to make sure people can get up here."</P><P>Naruto looked up at her and asked," Okay how are we going to do that?" Kyuubi realized that she hadn't thought of a way either. She knew that people would not want to climb up a huge pillar of trees to get up here. She also didnt want to make something that could transport them up here because invaders could use it to attack the village. " Damn it! I dont know how to make something that will transport people up here!" she yelled angrily as her chakra flared harshly, scaring Naruto. He backed away in fear before also thinking of a way.</P><P><I>" Lets see. I know people dont want climb up here, so I will not make a huge hill to get up here. If I find a way to make a portal up here, they could get up here easily, but enemies could use it to their advantage. Augh! This is hard...wait there is the portal to the Demon Realm. I got it! I'll make that portal I was thinking of, but I will then use energy from the Demon Realm portal and add it to my portal. With it added to my portal, it will keep the easy way up to my village from the enemies so that they will have to find another way to attack the village. Heh, with this, nice people can go in, but evil people cant,"</I> Naruto thought with a smirk at the end.</P><P>" Hey Kyuu-chan I have an idea," Naruto said as he looked at her. Kyuubi calmed down and looked over at him. " What is it?" she said.</P><P>" We create a portal. I cant think of how to make one now, but when I do, we make one so people can get up here easily and down here easily an-" he was cut off by Kyuubi," Kit I thought of the same thing, but I realized that it wouldnt work since enemies can attack the village easily."</P><P>" I realize that, but I have thought of a way to keep them out. First, we make the portal down there and up here at the main gate. Then, to make sure enemies cant use the portal, we suck demon energy out of that portal to the Demon Realm and infuse it with our portals so anybody pure evil cant get in through our portal," Naruto finished his explanation.</P><P>Kyuubi thought about what he said and realized that his idea could work. " Okay kit lets try it," she said. Naruto smirked as they went off to create the portals.</P><P>A/N Sorry it is so short, but I honestly could not think of anything else to put in this chapter.</P><P>Okay I have decided that you all can ask for any other women in Naruto that you want to be in this other than the choices I put up in the last chapter.</P><P>You can also ask for OCs. They can be demons, since the Demon Realm portal is near the village, and they can be humans. If you ask for an OC and have an idea for the OC, then I would appreciate it if you gave me a description for the OC, like what she looks like, her age, what village she is from (or just say from the Demon Realm if they are demons), etc.</P>
