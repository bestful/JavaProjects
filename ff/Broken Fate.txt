were the paniced thoughts of one Minato Namikaze, Konoha's 'Yellow
Flash' and their Fourth Hokage. Your probably wondering what could
have got him so paniced or who he is refurring to. Well it was like
this...</p><p><i><b>Flashback</b></i></p><p><i>Minato
had a shiver run up his spine. The walls had just stoped shaking from
that beastial roar. Kishuni, his wife, didn't notice it though. I
guess that can happen with a perticully difficult birth. She had been
in labor for at least fifteen hours now.</i></p><p><i>"Minato,
please..." Kishuni weased out.</i></p><p><i>"My
love, I'm sorry, but my men are dying and my village is in danger. It
is my duty as Hokage to protect this village with my life if need be.
I have to go." She could tell by the look in his eyes that this
was killing him inside. She nodded and pleaded five words before she
screamed in pain.</i></p><p><i>"Please,
come back to me." He nodded and adressed his sensei, Jaraiya.</i></p><p><i>"You
know what to do when he is born."</i></p><p><i>"Tell
me, Minato, What is to be his name?" The old man inquired. With
a sad smile, he vanished in a flash of light, the wind carrying his
words to the old perverts ears.</i></p><p><i>"Naruto
Uzumaki."</i></p><p><i>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</i></p><p><i>There
are few things that can make Minato shrink in fear. those things are:</i></p><p><i>1.
His wife's temper,</i></p><p><i>2.
The angry women of the hot spings form Jaraiya's 'reaserch' trips,</i></p><p><i>3.
When his wife finds a copy of 'Icha Icha Paradise' in their house,</i></p><p><i>And
this.</i></p><p><i>A
hundred foot, nine tailed fox with razor sharp teeth, claws and a
blood red coat of fur that can create earthquakes and tsunamis with a
stomp of it' foot, rending, tearing, and chomping on the finest
shinobi the Leaf has to offer, all the while laughing, shaking off
jutsu that whould send ANBU members running in terror like they were
flea bites.</i></p><p><i>'No
backing down now.' With a breath to steal himself, he bit his thumb
and went through the requi seals.</i></p><p><i><b>"Summoning
Jutsu: Gamabunta!"</b></i></p><p><i>With
a burst of smoke that could match the fox in size, there stood a red
toad with a gaint ninjato, a robe with a kanji on the back, and
Minato on his head.</i></p><p><i>"Gamabunta."</i></p><p><i><b>"Gaki."</b></i></p><p><i>"You
know the drill."</i></p><p><i><b>"Right!"</b></i><i>
With that he unsheathed his ninjato and held it at the ready, before
jumping at the fox, intending on stabing the creature. The Kyuubi
jumped to the right, while throwing a ball of fire from it's mouth.
Gamabunta jumped up avoiding the the attack, while perparing his own.</i></p><p><i><b>"Water
Style: Water Bullet Jutsu!"</b></i><i>
Several bullets of water, each as big as his head, shot out of his
mouth at the intended target.With agility that would have the Niibi
Nekomoto red with envy, the Kyuubi weaved though the Water Bullets
and got right up in Gamabunta's face. Before he could react, the
Kyuubi slashed down with it's mighty claws, effectivly rendering his
right eye useless.</i></p><p><i>"Gamabunta!"</i></p><p><i><b>"Dont't
loose your focus! I'm fine."</b></i><i>
Said the mighty toad. Before either of them could think of what to do
next, a swirl of leaves on the toads head borke all of the combatants
consentration, revealing Jaraiya, holding a baby boy in a blue clothe
with blond hair, sleeping in his arms.</i></p><p><i>"And
Kishuni..." Minato asked with fear in his voice. Jaraiya shook
his head, making the blond haired man drop to his knees, waterfalls
of tears streaming down his face.</i></p><p><i>"Minato..."
He said nothing. After a minute of silence he got a response.</i></p><p><i>"Are
the preparations complete?" The voice in which he asked that
question made the old man grimice, but he nodded. "Then let's
begin. Gamabunta! Hold off the Kyuubi while I do this!"</i></p><p><i><b>"You
got it!"</b></i><i>
While Gamabunta continued to fight of the beast Minato went through a
series of hundred of hand seals, completing them in under a minute.
With a booming voice he called out the name of the jutsu that would
seal his and the Kyuubi's fate.</i></p><p><i><b>"Death
God Sealing!"</b></i><i>
Soon a specter apeared behind Minato, the Shinigami, the Death God.It
was a grusome sight. It had purple skin, white untamable hair,red
teeth with black gums ,a knife with a red blade, and black tatoos
covering most of it's body. It wore a white tatered robe, had black
eyes with yellow irises and slited puples, and a face that made even
the Kyuubi's blood turn to ice.The Shinigami looked around until he
found the one that had summoned him to this plane of existance. </i></p><p><i>Putting
his knife in his mouth,the Shinigami reached out until he had a stong
hold on Minato's soul. He then reached out and grabed the fox's soul
and began the sealing. Everything seemmed to be going fine, well
exept for the inhuman amount of pain he had to go through, until he
heard somthing, or lack there of.</i></p><p><i>Naruto
had stoped screaming.</i></p><p><i>He
looked over and froze.</i></p><p><i>Naruto
wasn't breathing.</i></p><p><i>Naruto
was dead.</i></p><p><i>The
sealing would fail without a live host.</i></p><p><i>The
Kyuubi would go free and destroy the village.</i></p><p><i>And
he would be powerless to stop it.</i></p><p><i><b>Flashback:
Kai!</b></i></p><p><u><b>'Hmm.
The young one has passed on. This is not good. I have to finish this
sealing or I can't collect this human's soul. Well I will just have
to get him a new life. But where will I find a willing soul to
inhabite this body with the right circumstances...'</b></u></p><p><i><b>Entencive

puncturing his right lung, servere head trama, and a fractrured

do you want?'</p><p><u><b>"I
have a proposition for you. I have a problem and you can help me

over an infant's body so I can complete a seal, and you happen to fit

seen."</b></u></p><p>'What
do I get out of this 'proposition' you speak of?'</p><p><u><b>"Well

of a sudden a ball a blue light apeared, and shot out striking
Naruto. He soon continued to cry.</p><p>Minato
was overjoied. His son was alive. The village was saved. He could now
die without regrets.</p><p>The
Kyuubi howled in rage and pain, it's soul being seperated from it's
body and sealed into the now alive infant.</p><p>"The
seal is complete. My time has come. Jaraiya, make sure my son is seen
as the hero he is." The old Sannin nodded as the dying man held
his child in his arms. " I love you, my son. I am sorry."
Were his last words before his eyes closed and he fell backward,
lifeless.</p><p>If
