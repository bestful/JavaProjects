This one will follow the original plotmore than 'The Mishap'. However there are still changes to the original plot that you will see occuring. The reason for this is because there are soooooooooo many fics that use the old set up and quite frankly I don't want to follow that same path. There's only so much you can do with canon material.</b></p><p><b>As a result there will be things in here that some people may not like. Truth be told there's a lot of uncertainty on my end with plot lines, terminologies and characters. I can't go into too much detail without spoiling future content.</b></p><p><b>But that said there are features in this story that I have seen in many <i>many</i> others, although I use them in a different context. This makes this fic similar but different to be unique. Also, I myself have a very low knowledge of the original Naruto plot. I have only seen up to the begining of phase 2 of the chunin exams, just before they enter the forest of death. Reason being is because I found the canon Naruto character to be, well wrong. He seemed far too immature by constantly seeking attention instead of earning it. That doesn't mean I don't like Naruto, I just take a while to get through the series. The bulk of my knowledge comes from fan fiction. Normally that's a bad source but with the sheer number of stories here I have a very good idea of the sequence of events the plot takes.</b></p><p><b>Which leads me to the finer details. Jutsus won't be called out with words, nor will I write the handsign sequences, just to maintain a seemless flow of words in a fight scene. There won't be any new jutsus invented for this story either, there's more than enough in the canon arsenal to use as it is.</b></p><p><b>There will be terminologies and honorifics that I may get wrong, please feel free to correct me as I need the practice. I would rather write a piece of crap correctly than a masterpiece with errors throughout.</b></p><p><b>Also, due to the nature of the story's direction, there will be a large swathe of OCs. I am really trying to avoid these wherever possible so I will be sending pleas out for lore and suggestions as early as I can without giving spoilers.</b></p><p><b>And yes, this story is rated with the M tag for multiple reasons. I won't divulge those as again that involves spoilers. Just be prepared for M rated content, I have done/will do my best to lead into those gradually to provide ample warnings.</b></p><p><b>This will be updated once a week on a Saturday unless I have a writing spree again, I've had a few of those recently. I'm posting this chapter on Friday so chapter 2 will be up next weekend. It gives me enough time to fix my errors and swap OCs out for canon characters where possible.</b></p><p><b>Other than that, please enjoy this. I am trying to keep it as close to the original plot whilst adding my own flair to it. Some arcs won't be used but replacements will be created to develop the plot in a similar way. Other arcs will be used/modified to fit where possible.</b></p><p><b>So, here we go...</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The Life of the Hunted</p><p>Chapter 1</p><p>The story of Naruto Uzumaki, a blonde haired boy currently running through Konoha while being chased by a group of villagers. They brandished weapons as they shouted taunting words to his back, closing the distance rapidly between them and himself.</p><p>He was a mere five year old, forced to learn how to run before anything else. His grotesquely malnourished body was marked by numerous scars, evidence that this wasn't the first time he had been given hostile treatment. The things he classed as clothes, mere rags he had found that hung loosely from his small frame, barely offered anything in the way of warmth or dignity.</p><p>He didn't know why they chased him, or why they seemed to hate him, but they always hunted him. He had never had a peaceful sleep, nowhere was safe enough to rest in this village. The dark rings around his eyes proved his forced insomnia, the tears adding to his fearful expression.</p><p>A kunai impaled itself in the back of his left leg, behind the knee. He screamed in pain, just as he did each time he was attacked, as the group closed in on him. He couldn't hear their words now, the pain overwhelming every one of his senses. Nostalgia gripped him as he waited for what comes next. He didn't need to wait long.</p><p>The first foot connected with his body, driving the air from his lungs. As soon as he felt the first impact, more followed. He was beaten once again, mercilessly while the villagers simply laughed. His cries fell on deaf ears as they revelled in their brutality.</p><p>His excuse for clothing was torn off by a villager with a disturbing, maniacal grin. The rest gave him room as he whipped out his excuse for masculinity and shoved himself straight into Naruto's rear. The boy screamed harder, this way by far the worst torture he had to endure. It wasn't the first time either.</p><p>Time warped for the blonde, he had no idea how long the torture lasted. The only thing he was aware of was the pain, mind crushing pain. That and the foul man's hot fluid seeping out of him as he finally withdrew.</p><p>Then the blades made their entrance. Great arcs of blood were thrown skywards as flashes of metal slashed into the boy. He screamed the whole time, feeling his life drain away. The assault continued as it always did, ending with the villagers leaving Naruto in a pool of his own blood. His body twisted unnaturally as his broken bones allowed extra angles to be formed by his limbs. His breath came in painful rasps, broken ribs digging into a collapsed lung.</p><p>Naruto laid in the alley he was chased and beaten in. His eyes closed weakly as once again his injuries began to heal. How he didn't know, but he always felt a warm balm over his body whenever he was healed. The process wasn't painless though, far from it. His broken bones had to snap back in place before they could rejoin, causing as much pain as the beating itself. If his voice hadn't broken from all the screaming before then he would still be screaming now.</p><p>He writhed in agony as the damage was reversed, more scars forming from the gashes inflicted earlier. The whole process took as long as the beating did. Naruto struggled to his feet, the aches still present in his body. Sweat poured from him as his body temperature began to drop back to normal, the healing process generated a lot of heat.</p><p>Staggering to a dark corner in the alley Naruto slumped against the wall. He had nowhere else to go, no one to turn to. The entire village hated him for reasons he simply didn't know, shutting him out of their lives except to beat him. Once more the tears returned. He was five years old, every day of his existence had resulted in cruelly towards him. Every beating, every hateful glance, every ounce of neglect weighed heavily on him.</p><p>He hated the village as much as it hated him, but he could do nothing about it.</p><p>Allowing his drowsiness to take over Naruto cried himself to sleep, again.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Sarutobi sighed. The ANBU before him stood awaiting further orders after delivering the report. The Hokage simply pinched his brow.</p><p>"I assume he still survived?"</p><p>The ANBU didn't flinch. "Yes Hokage-sama. He still lives."</p><p>"I see." Sarutobi turned to look out the window. The village, his village, was basking in the light of the setting sun. "I wonder if things would be easier if he simply died. But he is our best weapon should things lead to war again."</p><p>"Hokage-sama?"</p><p>Sarutobi jumped slightly. "Ah yes, forgive me. Continue to watch him. There's no need to intervene in anything, as long as he still lives. Anything else is collateral, just stop Naruto from dying."</p><p>The ANBU bowed before leaving. "Yes Hokage-sama!"</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto woke, finding himself in some sort of sewer. Wearily he looked around himself. He hadn't sustained any more injuries, which in itself was very odd, but he definitely remembered falling asleep in an alley. This sewer was not said alley.</p><p>The water was frigid against his unclothed skin, he hadn't been able to find replacement garments to conceal himself with. His most recent scars stung from the icy water. He stood gingerly, still taking in his surroundings.</p><p>A deep rumble sounded in the distance, coming from the other end of the sewer. Naruto, being a five year old, decided he wanted nothing to do with whatever had made that noise. He sat against the side of the sewer, where the water was slightly shallower, and tried to drift back to sleep. He was unsuccessful at first, but eventually he slipped into the realm of dreams again.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>He woke once more, now back in the alley. He decided the sewer was a dream, it made more sense that way. Rubbing his eyes he began to search for new clothing, pulling out rags and scraps of fabric that semi fitted his frame. He eyed the drying pool of blood that he was left in, noting just how much there was. If it wasn't for his healing ability he would have been dead within minutes after being left.</p><p>Naruto, now wearing a fresher assortment of rags that offered more dignity, left the alley for another. This one was located behind a few food stalls, the bins out back containing morsels of food that he had been forced to survive on. He received countless hateful glares as he travelled, the occasions stone clipping his body. Fresh trails of blood streamed down him as his healing closed the wounds, yet more scars.</p><p>He reached the alley without further incident, most people not willing to escalate the violence towards him until night began to set. Not that anyone would intervene if someone did beat him in daylight, they would all likely join in. He scanned around the bins and other piles of discarded items, the stench of rotten food permeating his nose. He knew the food he ate wasn't good for him, but it's all he could get. He would hide briefly when people came into the alley and dumped more waste, before scurrying to the new pile in the hope of food. He found some edible items, not all were really classed as food anymore, before resigning in defeat and leaving the alley. People knew he survived like this, they were reducing what they put out so he had no food source. Water was easy, rain water was sort of safe to drink. It hadn't rained in a week though, so he had to literally lick condensation wherever he found it.</p><p>He retreated to his best hide away, his dark corner where most people couldn't find him. Another alley in a much quieter area of the village but isolated from any potential food sources. Crawling in the small hole he made in the piles of rubbish, he did his best to ignore the smell, Naruto laid down and tried to forget his hunger. He was always hungry. Always hungry and always lonely. His tears returned again as he drifted to sleep.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Again Naruto woke inside a sewer, the same one if he had to guess. Again he heard the rumbling, but this time something was pulling him backwards down the sewer. He tried to fight against it but he continued being pulled. He scrambled to find a hold on anything, groping for something to hold on to. Nothing came to his aid as he panicked, tears of fear streaming down his face.</p><p>Eventually he stopped, dropped back into the cold water. The rumbling was much louder now, rhythmic even. Almost like breathing...</p><p>Deep breathing...</p><p>Naruto panicked even more, imagining a huge monster looming over him. He slowly turned his head to look behind him, seeing the source of the terrifying noise.</p><p>Behind him lay a set of iron bars set deep into the walls. A single sheet of paper of unknown purpose lay across a large gate in the bars. But behind those bars were two massive red eyes, black slitted pupils boring straight into him. A set of large teeth flashed in a bestial grin before parting, releasing an enormous roar.</p><p>Naruto paled so much he looked dead, all colour draining from him. Wasn't it enough that the villagers beat and tortured him relentlessly? Obviously not if he's been thrown in front of this beast.</p><p>Not wanting to remain anywhere near this <i>thing</i>, Naruto jumped to his feet and ran back the way he came. He got five steps before he was immobilised by an unseen force. He dropped back into the water face first, curling into a ball in the last effort to protect himself. He knew he cried a lot, every day actually, but he couldn't stop the tears of fear pouring out of him as he laid in front of the bars, those eyes piercing his soul.</p><p>He waited to be eaten by those teeth, torn apart while it chewed on his malnourished body. He waited for the breath to wash over him shortly before the mouth closed around him. He waited, but nothing happened.</p><p>He uncurled just enough to see the beast, the eyes still piercing. He was laying right in front of the bars, easily within reach.</p><p>Said beast was surveying Naruto with its gaze. He couldn't read anything in those eyes. It seemed to gauge him for a while before retreating back slightly.</p><p><b>"Pathetic!"</b></p><p>That single word boomed out from the beast, causing Naruto to curl up again from the suddenness. A voice of power, frightening power that threatened to tear him asunder. He shivered where he laid, partially from fear and partially from the icy water.</p><p><b>"You can't even look at me! How can you call yourself a ninja?"</b></p><p>Naruto blinked from his cover. Ninja? He wasn't a ninja. He was a five year old boy with nothing, not a ninja. Seeing as this beast was speaking instead of eating him, he decided to respond.</p><p>"I-I'm not a ninja-"</p><p><b>"So you're just a snivelling boy, afraid of everything by the looks of it"</b></p><p>Naruto had to admit there was truth in that. It wasn't his fault though, his life so far had imposed that fear on him. "Y-Yes, I am." He watched the eyes become angry, causing him to panic again. "I-It's not my f-fault, they made me afraid!"</p><p>The beast paused, it hadn't expected that. <b>"Who did?"</b> It confused itself by asking such a question, such things were beneath it. Yet...</p><p>"Everyone. T-They hate me."</p><p>That <i>really</i> got the beast. <b>"Hate? Boy, you speak in riddles. I grow tired of such games, no more lies!"</b></p><p>"I'm not lying!" Naruto's conviction startled even himself. He uncurled again and stood defiantly before the beast, almost without fear. Almost.</p><p>The beast studied the boy again, looking for anything it might have missed before. Only now did it see the boy's condition. The ragged clothes barely performing as they should. The horrifically scarred, malnourished body that lay beneath. But it was the eyes that got its attention the most. The eyes that have never seen love, never seen kindness. Only pain, suffering, torture even. Things didn't add up for the beast, what it felt should have happened was far different to what it was seeing now.</p><p>The beast blinked. <b>"Boy, what has happened to you? This doesn't make sense."</b></p><p>Naruto dropped his head. "I don't want to talk about it."</p><p>There was a noise as the beast shifted. <b>"Do you know who I am?" </b>Naruto shook his head. <b>"I am Kyuubi, the nine tailed fox. How do you not know of me?"</b></p><p>Naruto's fear returned. "I-I do know of you. But you're dead! You were defeated five years ago!"</p><p>Kyuubi sighed deeply. <b>"So that's what they told you. No boy, I wasn't defeated. I can't simply be killed, so you're village did the next best thing." </b>Naruto didn't like where this was going. <b>"They sealed me away, inside you."</b></p><p>Naruto dropped to the floor, the pieces of his life fitting together. The Kyuubi wasn't killed, but sealed inside himself. The villagers hated the Kyuubi for what it had done to the village, then they turned that hate against him. For five years he wondered why, now he knew.</p><p>"So you're the reason everyone hates me." His voice was deathly low.</p><p><b>"You were supposed to be hailed as a hero."</b></p><p>He ignored the Kyuubi. "You're the reason I get treated how I do, why I have nothing in my life. Why I get beaten each night, it's all because of you!" Naruto was shouting by the time he had finished, pointing an accusing finger at the beast. Tears of fear had given way to tears of rage. "All because of you!"</p><p>For the first time, Kyuubi felt a deep sense of regret. <b>"Yes, it's because of me. But this wasn't supposed to happen. You should have been a hero, not hated."</b></p><p>Naruto dropped to the floor again, crying his frustration. "Why me? Why do I deserve this?"</p><p>Kyuubi, surprising itself again, stretched out a tail and encircled Naruto in an attempt to provide some comfort. He didn't resist the gesture, but he didn't stop his crying either.</p><p><b>"What is your name boy?"</b></p><p>He choked his reply out. "N-Naruto."</p><p>Kyuubi brought Naruto through the bars, lifting him level with one eye. <b>"Naruto, may I view your memories for myself, to understand what you have been through? I swear on my tails that I will cause you no harm."</b></p><p>Naruto, for want of anything better to do, nodded. Kyuubi closed its eyes as it began viewing the memories. It scanned through quickly yet thoroughly, not missing a single detail. Five years passed in five minutes, the eyes twitching in anger. Once it had seen enough the eyes snapped open, full of rage. Its tails, except the one holding Naruto, thrashed around as it roared.</p><p><b>"This is unacceptable! No being has the right to treat a child in this manner! This is worse than barbaric!"</b> It ranted for a while longer before calming itself. <b>"Naruto, if I had had any idea of what you have been through... Forgive my brash words before, I was too quick to assume."</b></p><p>"No." Kyuubi startled at that. It was just about to verbally tear him apart when he spoke again. "You had every right to assume. You believed what you thought would happen, it wasn't you who did these things to me."</p><p>Kyuubi calmed down, confused by Naruto removing the blame from it. <b>"I suppose you're right."</b></p><p>"So what do we do now?"</p><p><b>"I don't know."</b> It sounded strange for Kyuubi to say that. Naruto was placed back down on his own feet, the tail releasing him and returning behind the bars.<b> "I could try to train you, so you won't be beaten again."</b></p><p>Naruto looked at Kyuubi, traces of hope in his eyes. "Can you do that?"</p><p><b>"I'm not sure of the limitations behind the seal, but I can try all the same."</b></p><p>"What if I removed the seal?"</p><p><b>"No! That would possibly kill us both. The risk is too high. I will find a way Naruto, I give you my word."</b></p><p>Naruto smiled, the first smile since he could remember. That alone made it all worth while for Kyuubi.</p><p><b>"One more thing Naruto. You should be aware of your heritage, since you haven't been told yet. Another crime on the list against this village."</b></p><p>Naruto looked to Kyuubi. "You know my parents?"</p><p>Kyuubi nodded solemnly. <b>"I did. You are aware that the forth Hokage sealed me inside you, but you aren't aware that he sealed me into his only son. The forth Hokage, Minato Namikaze, was your father."</b></p><p>Naruto remained surprisingly impassive at that remark. Kyuubi had expected some sort of reaction at least, but there was none.</p><p>"And what of my mother?" There was no emotion in his voice now, the words flat.</p><p><b>"Kushina Uzumaki, also known as the 'Red Death'."</b></p><p>Naruto cast his eyes up, away from Kyuubi. "So both my parents were strong figures of their time, both sacrificing themselves to save the village at my cost."</p><p>Kyuubi shook its head. <b>"Not quite Naruto. While Minato's life was taken during the sealing, such was the price to pay, Kushina survived. Although where she is remains a mystery. She wasn't in any of your memories."</b></p><p>"That means my father made a selfish sacrifice that ruined the life of his son, while my mother simply left me behind. Loyalty doesn't seem to run in my family."</p><p><b>"It would appear so. Why your mother hasn't been around for you is very confusing. She definitely survived the sealing and the attack prior. She may have passed since then or, as you say, left you behind."</b></p><p>Naruto was silent for an uncomfortable amount of time. Kyuubi waited for a response from the blonde, but one never came.</p><p><b>"Naruto?"</b> Nothing. He simply stood before the cage, eyes unfocussed as he roamed his thoughts. He remained that way for a few minutes, until he abruptly vanished from view.</p><p>Kyuubi was left alone pondering what the kid was thinking. The only way to find out apart from asking was to 'alter' the seal. With a task at hand the fox began to work. The process would also allow Kyuubi to oversee Naruto as he lived, providing support where needed. And there was the possibility of taking over the child if things got out of hand that he couldn't deal with alone.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>A/N: First chapter. By now you should see a few differences with the original plot.</b></p><p><b>Sarutobi isn't as benevolent as canon, he actually sees Naruto in the same way as the Kazekage sees Gaara, a weapon. This offers a new perspective for future content.</b></p><p><b>Kushina wasn't killed alongside Minato. I know this has been used before but I wanted my own flair to this as well.</b></p><p><b>Also is Naruto's opinion of his parents. This may or may not have been used before but again I wanted this to help develop Naruto in a different light. Not to spoil it but the next chapter reinforces these points. You'll see what I mean next weekend.</b></p><p><b>I also felt that the relunctance to walk towards Kyuubi was more akin to a five year old than blind curiosity. Another little twist.</b></p><p><b>Well, that's all for me. If people wish to help me with this story and don't mind spoilers, send me a PM or visit my forum and leave me a comment. I have no objection to giving spoilers to those who don't mind them. Until next time...</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p><b>A/N: Chapter 2. Something new and quite frankly disturbing happens here. I have seen this used many times before by other writers, but never in this manner. If I scar anyone, sorry (Muhaha)</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The Life of the Hunted</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>Sarutobi sat at his desk filling in more of his paperwork as usual when a knock sounded against his door. With a sigh he moved the papers aside and sat straight.</p><p>"Enter."</p><p>The door opened to admit a female member of the civilian council. Each time one of the civilians entered his office Sarutobi knew there was a headache looming for him. He braced himself for the latest rant.</p><p>"Hokage-sama." Sarutobi blinked in surprise at the formality. "There's something that has come to our attention regarding two of our clans in Konoha."</p><p>"And what might that be?" His interest was always spiked when news of clans was discovered.</p><p>The civilian brushed back a lock of hair. "Clans Namikaze and Uzumaki were believed to be wiped out in the Kyuubi attack. We have come across information that this isn't true. One individual is heir to both these clans."</p><p>Sarutobi's eyes widened slightly. "You have a name?"</p><p>"Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze."</p><p>Sarutobi sat back in his chair. "The weapon. Who would have thought? But then again Minato wasn't the kind to use another parents' child for sealing like that, it's typical of him."</p><p>"I believe, as do many others who share this knowledge, that Naruto should be used to replenish these clans. Konoha will be feared again with the Uzumaki and Namikaze clans at full strength."</p><p>"Very true, but he is too young for that. He hasn't developed enough to be eligible for clan restoration."</p><p>"We have someone available who can 'solve' that issue by forcing his body to mature enough overnight, after which he will be fully able to comply. The clans must take priority Hokage-sama."</p><p>"And they do." Sarutobi nodded. "Very well. Do what you need to do, I will have Naruto brought to the holding cells. I doubt he will be willing so restraints will be required. "</p><p>The civilian left to begin the preparations. The thought of restarting two of Konoha's most known and feared clans made Sarutobi giddy with excitement. He would place his village back on top once more. If the weapon had to be sacrificed to achieve that, so be it.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto woke in his hide away, the knowledge from his exchange with the Kyuubi fresh in his mind. His stomach reminded him of his hunger as he crawled out into the alley proper. It was dark again, he would almost certainly be attacked tonight. Just like every other night. The difference now is he knew why.</p><p>He crept to the end of the alley and glanced around. No one was close by at the moment so he snuck onto the street. He had taken no more than five steps when a figure appeared in front of him.</p><p>"Naruto, you will come with me."</p><p>This figure was dressed in what the blonde knew to be ANBU gear, the animal mask confirming it. This one resembled a bear.</p><p>"W-Why?"</p><p>"I am not at liberty to say, but you will come with me." Bear held their hand out for Naruto to hold.</p><p>The gesture seemed friendly enough, but he had never been given a friendly gesture before. Alarm bells rang inside his head as he reached forwards. Even if it felt wrong he had no choice but to do as he was asked.</p><p>As soon as he took the hand offered to him they disappeared, appearing inside a locked cell. Before Naruto could ask what was going on he found himself chained to a wall, the cold metal making him shiver. Bear looked down upon him.</p><p>"You carry the DNA of two powerful clans, two clans we need back in Konoha. It is your duty to spread that DNA around to prevent these clans from dying out entirely."</p><p>Naruto sat with fear in his eyes. He wasn't entirely sure of what that meant. Bear left soon after they finished speaking, leaving Naruto chained and alone.</p><p>Seeing his situation the blonde began to weep again, eventually crying himself to sleep once more.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>He woke again inside the sewer. Perhaps the Kyuubi might know what was going on. He ran through the water towards the cage, sighing the beast within. He stopped before the bars, regaining his breath.</p><p>"K... Kyuubi... Sama..."</p><p><b>"Breathe Naruto, and stop with the sama stuff. What's gotten into you?"</b></p><p>Naruto fought for air. "They said... I have DNA Of two clans... They want to... Restart... What do... They mean?"</p><p>Naruto saw the Kyuubi's eyes flash with anger. <b>"They wouldn't dare!"</b></p><p>"Dare what?"</p><p><b>"They plan on using you as a breeding machine, impregnating as many women as possible to produce children. But you're far too young for that. They must be planning on making your reproductive organs mature far faster than normal, how is unknown but I do know it's extremely dangerous. There will be extreme pain, possibly death if done too fast. Not to mention the acts that will inevitably follow."</b></p><p>Naruto blanched with fear. "I-Is there nothing you can do to stop it?"</p><p>Kyuubi looked down on Naruto with pity. <b>"There is a way, but I can only do it after they alter you. All I need to do is flood the necessary organs with my youki and make you sterile. I can undo the damage later if required, but it will prevent you from producing children. However it won't stop the women from trying. I'm sorry Naruto, it's all I can offer."</b></p><p>Naruto gave a weak look of gratitude. "It's more than anyone else will do Kyuubi. Thank you." He would have said more but he was pulled from his mind as he was woken violently in the cell.</p><p>Kyuubi wore a concerned look as it went back to studying the seal. Naruto needed help fast.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto woke with a start as two people pinned him down, removing the rags he wore on his small frame. Chakra streamed into him, focused on his lower regions. Intense pain flooded his senses and caused him to scream out against it. One of the people gagged him to shut him up before resuming whatever they were doing.</p><p>The whole process lasted for hours, most of the night had passed before they left him. His body still burned with agony but it was slowly fading. He glanced down at himself but saw no obvious differences.</p><p>He felt Kyuubi's youki move through him again, just like it did whenever he got injured. This time though there were no injuries to heal. The youki stopped around his lower regions before a single sharp pain jolted through him. It was over as quick as it started as the youki returned to whence it came.</p><p>Naruto tried to cover himself with the rags he previously wore, now torn and shredded where the people had torn them off him. He shivered against the cold air, awaiting whatever else was due to come his way.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Sarutobi sat at his desk as soon as he arrived for the day. There was a note on the table stating that Naruto was ready. He summoned Bear into the room.</p><p>"Yes Hokage-sama?"</p><p>"Inform the candidates that Naruto is ready. Make the appropriate arrangements and begin as soon as possible."</p><p>Bear bowed. "At once Hokage-sama."</p><p>As soon as the ANBU had left, Sarutobi allowed his greedy smirk to return. <i>'Two of the most powerful clans will soon be ours again Konoha. We will be feared once more.'</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The cell door opened at a few hours before midday, or so Naruto guessed. A single female entered the room before the door closed again. There wasn't anything special about her, just another face in a crowd. She approached with a bored expression on her face before kneeling before the blonde.</p><p>"Don't think for a minute that I'll take any enjoyment from this, demon. I have a duty to uphold, as do you."</p><p>Naruto gulped as she swiped away his rags. He tried his best to simply ignore what was going to happen as the female dropped her lower garments and straddled him. He was far too young to appreciate the female body or the act he was being forced into, making it easy for him to overlook the details that most eligible males would crave for.</p><p>A hand roughly seized his altered masculinity before something warm and slightly wet surrounded it. He didn't need to look to know what was going on now.</p><p>The female began to rise and fall on him, not caring for subtly or delicacy with her actions. She just wanted this over with so the next female could perform her duty. But as much as she didn't want to, she began to enjoy the feeling of his altered member inside her.</p><p>Because of the work done to him during the night he was far over the usual proportions of someone his age, most males would be very jealous if they knew a five year old possessed something of this calibre. She tried to deny herself from her build up, but failed. She ended up emptying her release over the boy's small frame as she continued. Twice more she climaxed before she felt him tense inside her.</p><p>Naruto was in hell. What she was doing to him was causing a burning all over his body. There was simply no way he could find any enjoyment from this, how anyone else could was a mystery. It hurt so much. It only got more unpleasant when a substantial amount of fluid cascaded over his lower body. He refused to search for the source as it meant looking at what was going on. His stomach was already churning without the visual aid to throw up.</p><p>Twice more the fluid flooded onto him, the third time did cause him to throw up to his right. He felt something surge within himself, yielding more pain as he felt something leave his altered member. The female on him seemed to stop at the same time, a silent gasp escaping her.</p><p>She remained that way for a few seconds before slowly rising from him. He refused to look at her as she dressed herself again and left the cell, leaving him alone, naked and covered in some sort of fluid. He still refused to look at himself.</p><p>Tears fell from his eyes as the agonising pain still course around him. He passed out soon after.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Two more females visited him that day, the first having to leave straight away as he was still unconscious. He couldn't perform as required if he wasn't conscious. The second female though was able to do what was needed, making the blonde pass out for the second time that day.</p><p>Sarutobi sat at his desk as the ANBU assigned as Naruto's door guard stood before him.</p><p>"It seems his body can't handle the strain being placed on him. He passes out soon after the candidates leave. I already had to turn one woman away as a result, she has rescheduled for tomorrow."</p><p>Sarutobi sighed. "I see. So we are limited to two a day, with a good few hours in between sessions. Pity, that will slow things considerably. I am surprised though that the weapon lacks the stamina to continue on. I thought he would have gained that from having the demon sealed within."</p><p>Bear nodded. "That was my assumption as well. On closer inspection though it seems the fox is only able to heal wounds. The boy has gained nothing else as a benefit or otherwise from the sealing."</p><p>"Continue to watch him, inform me of any other details."</p><p>"Yes Hokage-sama."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto shivered in the night. His rags were discarded across the room, easily out of his reach.</p><p>Inside the seal Kyuubi was still trying to alter the seal. There was some progress when a few sensations not belonging to the fox drifted in, mostly pain and sorrow. This made the fox angry and redouble its efforts to help the boy. It would be slow but eventually Naruto would get the help he needed.</p><p>Naruto was simply slumped on the floor, the only position the chains allowed him to be in. He couldn't even close his legs or use his arms to warm himself against the cold drafts that washed over him. His body felt numb with the pain and cold, he just wished he could die and be free of this.</p><p>He rubbed his wrists against the shackles, the rough metal cutting into his skin slowly. Blood seeped down the chains and dripped onto the floor. Each cut he made was healed by Kyuubi's youki as soon as it bled. He rubbed harder, trying to cut faster than the youki could heal. It didn't work.</p><p>He gave up with a cry of despair, opting to just lay where he was and accept his fate. He glanced down briefly, ignoring his previous vow, and saw the monstrosity that had replaced his masculinity. Grossly disproportionate to his tiny frame he found it hard to believe it possible to possess something like that. He cried at his disfigured body, the scars he wore only adding to the ugly look he had.</p><p><i>'What have they done to me?'</i></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p><b>A/N: Right, this chapter marks where I'm flexing my originality. The differences will be obvious as they come up but I am still keeping to some of the various plot arcs that arrive later on. Others will be replaced with more fitting ones as needed, but also there will be a fairly high amount of OCs entering later too. This is due to where the story is heading, but if people know of suitable canon characters then please let me know. The less OCs I use the better.</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The Life of the Hunted</p><p>Chapter 3</p><p>Two weeks passed like this for Naruto. He was subject to his 'duty' twice a day, each time with a different female and each time he passed out afterwards. He hadn't eaten or drank properly during that week, his energy was low. How he was still alive baffled him.</p><p>Kyuubi was still working on the seal. More of the boy's sensations were filtering through now, the fox acutely aware of each agonising experience Naruto was forced to endure. They had exchanged a few words during the occasional lapse Naruto had when he retreated inside his mind, most of their conversations were Kyuubi's attempts to provide the blonde with some comfort.</p><p>He currently laid chained to the floor, in the same position he was put in on day one, shivering from the cold air. He wished for an end to his life. An escape from the hell he was feeling. A way out. Something. <i>Anything.</i></p><p>The cell door opened yet again, another female entering. Naruto fought back the new tears as she prepared herself and impaled her body on his mutated appendage.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Sarutobi paced back and forth behind his desk in his office. Bear stood opposite, awaiting his response. The Hokage glanced to his ANBU.</p><p>"Are they all certain of this?"</p><p>Bear nodded. "Yes Hokage-sama. Each female has confirmed that they aren't pregnant after seeing Naruto."</p><p>Sarutobi sighed. "What does this mean?"</p><p>"If I may offer an observation Hokage-sama, I believe the boy to possibly be sterile. For all these females to have failed in becoming pregnant, it rules out any other reason."</p><p>"Can you fix this?"</p><p>Bear shook his head. "Personally no, and I have already consulted with the medical staff. No one has a solution. I don't think Naruto will ever have children."</p><p>Sarutobi sighed deeper this time. "Very well. You may as well release him. Continuing this is pointless now."</p><p>"Yes Hokage-sama."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto regained consciousness to find himself in an alley. His head whipped round him, confusion reigning in his head. He had been released from the cell and left here, still without clothing. The smell of the many females who had visited him still pungent in his nose. His lower body was slightly crispy from all the dried fluid. He did his best to ignore it.</p><p>He rose slowly, muscles protesting from the sudden use after so much neglect. Faint cracking sounds emitted from the dried fluids covering him. He couldn't take it anymore, he threw up where he stood. Well he would have done if he had anything to bring up. Instead he dry heaved over and over.</p><p>Once he had recovered and successfully blotted out the thoughts of his own body he surveyed the alley. He managed to retrieve 'fresh clothing' to hide himself better but couldn't find food. He needed another alley first.</p><p>Carefully he snuck out of the alley he was in and headed for the area that held the most promise for food. He avoided open areas this time due to the insecurities of his body. It took him a long time but he eventually found his way safely to the alleys.</p><p>A quick rummage through the waste yielded a few scraps that took the edge of his hunger but nothing more. Sighing in defeat again he left to return to his hide away. After crawling inside he settled down again to sleep.</p><p>His dreams were plagued with his parents, more so the knowledge he had gained from the Kyuubi about them. How his father had condemned him to this life of torture. How his mother had abandoned him for whatever corner she now resided in.</p><p>Uzumaki. Namikaze. Two names that meant nothing to him except hurt, pain and loneliness.</p><p>Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze. He hated that name now. One linked him to a legend who doomed his life, the other left him. He dropped the two names, only keeping his first name as his identity. He wanted nothing to do with his parents and everything that came with them. What right did they have to call him their son now?</p><p>Naruto woke more troubled than when he first went to sleep. He couldn't take it anymore.</p><p>He pushed himself out of his hole and vacated the alley. His mind was set, this village held nothing but hatred towards him. This was the home of his parents, not him. This was the place that hated him, not thanked for his forced sacrifice. He could not, <i>would</i> not stay here. And he knew exactly where to go, inflicting the most damage on Konoha in the process.</p><p>He wasn't a smart kid, but everyone knew something. He happened to know of some feuds between different parties, snippets of conversation overheard from others in the village. He was about to jeopardise the future of the village he hated so much.</p><p>He slipped out through the gate, the guards not caring a damn as he passed by, and walked off into the distance.</p><p>It took him a long time, being a five year old, but eventually he made it to the border. With a weighted step of determination he left Fire country and entered Earth country, heading for Konoha's long time enemy. Iwa.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"We have lost track of Naruto, Hokage-sama."</p><p>Sarutobi faced the ANBU, perplexed. "A five year old boy evaded you inside this village, one you know so well?"</p><p>Bear nodded grimly. "It would seem so, Hokage-sama."</p><p>Sarutobi couldn't believe what he was hearing. A child evading his ANBU... "He can't have gone far, check the alleys. That's where he normally hides." <i>'The weapon is learning. He will indeed be a powerful tool for Konoha.'</i></p><p>"Yes, Hokage-sama."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto walked through the gate into Iwa. The guards didn't seem bothered that a five year old wearing rags had entered the village. He stood just inside, studying the area.</p><p>It had taken him a week to get here. But now that he had arrived it seemed worth it. Here he was a nobody, at least he wouldn't be hated.</p><p>He didn't get a lot of time to think as a figure approached him. Instinctively he put his arms up to protect himself, preparing for the first strike.</p><p>"Woah, easy there. I won't hurt you." Naruto looked up through his arms into the kind looking face of a young female. "I haven't seen you here before, where are you from?"</p><p>Naruto didn't answer the question. "Can I see your Kage?"</p><p>"You mean the Tsuchikage?" He nodded. "May I ask why?"</p><p>Naruto hung his head. "I want a home."</p><p>The female took in his appearance again, seeing the rags and malnourished body beneath. A sense of pity formed inside her, granting her temporary conviction. "Follow me, I'll make sure he sees you."</p><p>They walked to the Kage palace and were granted passage. The building itself was like the rest of the village, carved entirely out of stone. The tower itself was the tallest building within the village, the conical roof an iconic feature. Once outside the Tsuchikage's office the woman knocked once.</p><p>An old gravelly voice came from the other side. "What is it?"</p><p>"There's a young boy here who wishes to see you Tsuchikage-sama."</p><p>A sigh sounded. "Send him in."</p><p>The door opened as Naruto was gently pushed inside, closing behind him. The young boy looked into the old face of the Tsuchikage, Konoha's most revered enemy.</p><p>A figure of power despite his obvious age. He seemed to reflect the nature of the village itself, old yet still standing strong. His well built frame bespoke his strength as he sat behind his desk. His white hair and moustache framed his aged face, his short stature also relaying his age.</p><p>The man studied the boy as well, seeing the rags with a distasteful look on his face. He also saw the numerous scars and over pronounced bones that marked malnutrition.</p><p>He clenched his fists. "This is unacceptable. No one should be living like this in my village. How may others are there like you boy?"</p><p>Naruto shook his head. "I'm not from this village."</p><p>This triggered an alarm bell in the Tsuchikage's head. "Then why are you here?"</p><p>"I want a home. Somewhere that doesn't hate me for who I am. Somewhere that doesn't beat me and try to kill me daily." If it wasn't for the scars on the boy's body the Tsuchikage wouldn't have believed those words. "I know you have a feud with another village but I want you to hear what and who I am."</p><p>That caught the man by surprise. "What does that mean?"</p><p>Naruto sighed. "I am Naruto, jinchuuriki of the nine tailed fox, Kyuubi."</p><p>It took a second for the Tsuchikage to make the connection. "You're a Konoha ninja! Tell me why I shouldn't have you killed!" He reached for a weapon.</p><p>"Because I'm not a ninja, and Konoha hates me as much as I now hate them. There's nothing there for me."</p><p>The conviction alone stayed the man's hand. He recalled the earlier words and the boy's visual appearance. "They did this to you?" Naruto nodded. The Tsuchikage dropped his hostility like a hot knife. "Konoha or not, no one should have to live like that. Iwa is your home should you wish so." Naruto's eyes lit with hope. "Just one thing though, where are your parents?"</p><p>Naruto scowled, startling the man. "My<i> father</i>," he spat the word, "sealed the fox inside me without pausing to consider the outcome of my life. His own life was taken as a result, he got what he deserved." The Tsuchikage knew who sealed the fox, this boy was his son. But Naruto seemed to harbour no good feelings for the man responsible for his situation and so many deaths in Iwa in years past. "My mother, if she lives, abandoned me just as quickly. Her body wasn't found so she could still be alive, although she can stay and rot wherever she is." He also knew who his mother likely was, again the boy had no fond feelings towards her. He hated his own parents, the Tsuchikage could use that.</p><p>Naruto's arrival could tip the balance of power heavily in his favour. All he needed to do to ensure his loyalty was provide the one thing Konoha failed to give.</p><p>A family.</p><p>The man sighed, sitting deep into his chair. "Naruto. I cannot hope to fully understand what you have been through. Truth be told I'm not sure I'll survive knowing either, your scars are enough to send chills down my spine. I wish I could say that a family will take you in quickly, but I don't think that will happen. Not because of who or what you are, but because the people of Iwa are as stubborn as the rock itself. Adoption is rare in this village, mostly because there aren't any orphans here." Naruto wore a dejected look. "However I can offer you something else."</p><p>Naruto snapped his head up. "What's that?"</p><p>"I have a granddaughter of my own who is frequently left out of the world. My job as Tsuchikage has kept me from her for too long. Her mother was taken from us by illness, while her father is was lost during a previous war. I am all she has and even I can't be with her as much as she needs me to. I would like to adopt you myself, both to give you a home and a family, and to give my granddaughter a brother."</p><p>Naruto's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "I would like that very much."</p><p>The Tsuchikage smiled an uncharacteristic smile. He stood from his chair, not gaining much height due to his short stature, and walked round to Naruto. He extended a hand to the blonde boy. "Let me take you to your home Naruto."</p><p>Naruto took the hand offered to him and allowed himself to be lead out of the office. The Tsuchikage waved to his secretary.</p><p>"I'll be unavailable for a bit while I help our newest resident here settle in. Hold any messages for me."</p><p>"Of course Tsuchikage-sama."</p><p>Naruto followed the man as he took them through the palace, stopping before an elaborate set of doors. Once opened the blonde got his first look at the place he would be calling home.</p><p>It wasn't anything special but it definitely beat the alleys he was used to. The rooms were clean and well furnished. There was plenty of food to go around for days on end, even a shower for getting the dirt off one's body. A luxury Naruto hadn't had before. He was so overwhelmed at what he saw before him that he failed to see the small girl standing in front of them.</p><p>"Who's this Jiji?"</p><p>Her pink eyes stared in wonder at Naruto, her black hair framing her young face. She stood a few inches taller than the blonde and had the air of innocence that all children should possess, an air Naruto had lost years ago.</p><p>The Tsuchikage smiled again. "This is Naruto. He will be staying with us from now on. He's going to be your brother Kurotsuchi."</p><p>"My new nii-san?"</p><p>"Yes Kurotsuchi, your new nii-san."</p><p>Naruto began to feel slightly awkward as the attention drifted to him. He shifted his weight multiple times and dropped his head a little, unsure of what to do. A few drops of water appeared on the floor by his feet. The Tsuchikage frowned slightly at his reaction.</p><p>Kurotsuchi also frowned, bending down to get a better look at Naruto's face. "Jiji? What's wrong with nii-san?"</p><p>Naruto dropped his head further to hide his face from her. He felt the Tsuchikage place a comforting hand on his shoulder. "It's all right Naruto. You have a family now."</p><p>"I know... Thank you..."</p><p>Those words were all he could say. The man guided him towards an empty bedroom, now allocated to the blonde, and sat him on the bed.</p><p>"This will be your room all right? I have to go back to the office for a bit but I will come back soon. Kurotsuchi will still be here should you need anything, but I think you want to be alone for now, yes?" Naruto nodded slowly, still hanging his head. "All right. I'll leave you for now. Don't think your alone anymore Naruto, we are both here for you now."</p><p>The Tsuchikage left him, ushering Kurotsuchi out with him and giving Naruto the space he needed. More tears left the blonde's eyes after he was on his own. He had a home, a family. Two things he felt impossible despite what he originally asked for when he arrived here. To actually have those things brought tears of joy to his eyes.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><p><b>A/N: Next chapter is here. If anyone reads this and my other fic, I'm dropping the update frequency to once a week (Wednesday) due to a lack of interest. There hasn't been many alerts for it since the start of the month so I'm slowing down the progress to focus on other, more successful stories.</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The Life of the Hunted</p><p>Chapter 4</p><p>The Tsuchikage walked away from the room now belonging to Naruto after closing the door. Kurotsuchi walked beside him.</p><p>"Jiji? Why is nii-san crying?"</p><p>He sighed, turning to his granddaughter with a sad smile. "Naruto comes from a place that wasn't very kind to him Kurotsuchi. He didn't have very much before coming here. He has a lot of sadness in his heart."</p><p>Kurotsuchi's face dropped. "Naruto, nii-san. But Jiji, he has us now right?" She turned her sad face to the Tsuchikage.</p><p>He smiled again, but a genuine one. "Yes Kurotsuchi. He has us now. He has his own Jiji and a nee-chan to help him."</p><p>She smiled in return. "Yeah. I'll help nii-san every day!"</p><p>He widened his smile and rubbed her head. "I know you will. We both will."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The Tsuchikage returned from his office at the end of the day. Pushing open the door to his home he listened for any sounds from the two inhabitants he lived with. He heard none.</p><p>He went to the bedrooms to find Naruto's door still firmly closed. This troubled him slightly. He decided to leave him be for now.</p><p>He returned to the main area of the home and found Kurotsuchi sitting on the floor as she usually did, staring into space. She noticed him approach.</p><p>"Hi Jiji."</p><p>He smiled back. "You been behaved today Kurotsuchi?" She nodded as usual. He knew she never got into trouble but he made a habit of asking to show interest. "Has Naruto left his room yet?"</p><p>"No Jiji, nii-san hasn't come out at all."</p><p>The Tsuchikage frowned at this. He glanced back in the direction of Naruto's room before sighing.</p><p>"I'm sure he'll be fine Kurotsuchi. Let's start dinner shall we?"</p><p>Contrary to popular belief the Tsuchikage is a hands on type of person. He prefers doing things for himself rather than having others do it for them. So most people find it hard to believe when he plays a major role in preparing meals with his granddaughter. It helps him to forget his age.</p><p>Half way through their preparations someone knocked on the door. The Tsuchikage left Kurotsuchi to continue as he dealt with the visitor. He opened the door to see his chief ANBU awaiting him.</p><p>"Tsuchikage-sama, I apologise for the disturbance."</p><p>The man sighed. "For the last time, when I'm not working don't address me as my title."</p><p>The ANBU bowed. "My apologies again Onoki-sama."</p><p>"What is it you wish to see me about?"</p><p>The ANBU straightened again. "There are rumors of a newcomer to the village. I was making sure if you knew of them or not."</p><p>"I am aware, and they are true. We have gained a new member to the village, one who currently lives in this very house."</p><p>"Oh? May I ask who Onoki-sama?"</p><p>Onoki faced the ANBU seriously. "The son of Minato Namikaze and Kushina Uzumaki, the jinchuuriki of the nine tailed fox, Naruto Uzumaki Namikaze."</p><p>The ANBU looked torn between violence and confusion. "Onoki-sama, need I point out the danger this Naruto places Iwa in?</p><p>His eyes narrowed slightly. "You needn't bother. He is a resident of Iwa, nothing else."</p><p>"But Onoki-sama-"</p><p>"But nothing." He cut the ANBU off with a wave of his hand. "His father is dead and his mother left him alone. He has been seriously ill treated by Konoha to the point where he loathed the village he was forced to sacrifice himself for. He came to us for a home, a life. I will give him exactly that, for we will gain a significant advantage over Konoha as a result. However he will not be a weapon to be set loose on our enemies. He is a child, a human just like us. He has feelings, desires, hopes. Konoha tried to smash those, I will not make the same mistake they did."</p><p>The ANBU relaxed slightly. "If you feel this is best Onoki-sama then I will not pursue the issue. However, what shall we do if Konoha comes asking for the boy?"</p><p>"Naruto is an Iwa resident, we will defend him as one of our own. Actually, you can spread your own rumors around. Let it slip who this new resident is, his origins and parentage, and I will address the village as soon as he has settled in."</p><p>"Of course Onoki-sama. I shall leave you to your evening."</p><p>The ANBU left as Onoki closed the door and returned to Kurotsuchi. They resumed their work without any words, Kurotsuchi knew her grandfather received visitors after he got back so was used to the disturbances. She never asked about them.</p><p>Eventually Onoki got concerned enough about Naruto that he decided to check on him. Leaving Kurotsuchi to finish up he made his way to the blonde's room.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto laid curled on the floor beside the bed. Having a bedroom was an alien concept for him, the bed beside him didn't seem right for sleeping in or on. The floor he was used to, so he stuck with what he knew.</p><p>Inside the seal the Kyuubi had made further progress. Naruto's absence had concerned the fox to such an extent that it was devoting all its time to altering the seal so the beast could gain proper access to the boy's senses, and communicate mentally once the link was established. It would all take time but, seeing as Naruto had last come before the cage in such a state about being a breeding machine, time didn't seem like a luxury they had.</p><p>Naruto had fallen asleep a few minutes after he was left in his room. He was exhausted from all the travelling he had done to reach Iwa and the lack of food had severely weakened him, as if his malnourished body wasn't enough of a sign for that. His sleep was so deep that he managed to avoid being pulled into his mind with Kyuubi. The fox had tried to bring him before it but ultimately failed, partly because of the seal's restrictions and partly because the boy was sound asleep.</p><p>His dreams, as usual, were plagued with dark images of torture and death. Despite experiencing all of this first hand he still found terror in the mental images, the pain felt so real. He dreamt of being set aflame as people simply watched, some cheering at his demise. He dreamt of having his blood drained from his body, powerless to do anything as his life essence was taken from him. Having every bone shattered in his body. Having his head crushed by a mob of people. Almost every way to die was concocted in his head, each one more gruesome than the previous. Rape, mutilation, his mind reeled from all the mental pain he was feeling.</p><p>He tried to scream but no sounds escaped his mouth. He then realised his mouth was glued shut, the skin flowing like water to permanently keep him silent. His eyes were forced shut, the skin around them also flowing over those dull blue orbs. His ears dropped off his head, the skin where they once were unmarked by any features. His face melted away, his head becoming a smooth mass of flesh and hair. He panicked like never before as his fingers faded into his hands, stumps at the end of his shrinking arms. His body became a single mass of flesh, every appendage merging with the lump he was becoming.</p><p>Back in the seal the room began to shake violently. Kyuubi stopped its work as cracks began to form across the walls and floor, great chunks of the roof collapsing on itself. Rubble piled on the fox as realisation dawned on it. The boy's mind was breaking down, something was literally tearing it apart.</p><p>Panicking as much as its container the fox threw its youki at the seal, trying to bring Naruto out of whatever was happening to him. If Kyuubi couldn't rouse the boy then both of them were in serious trouble.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Onoki knocked on Naruto's door but no reply came. Worried he opened the door, searching for the blonde. He had expected to see him in or on the bed so became more concerned when the bed was empty. He had no time to wonder why as he heard a sound from the other side of the bed.</p><p>He entered the room fully, walking round the bed to where he heard the noise. On the floor, curled into a tight ball, was Naruto's shaking form.</p><p>The boy was clearly in distress, his eyes wandered aimlessly under closed lids. His fists were clenched so hard he drew blood, flecks of red scattered on and all around him. His mouth was contorted into an expression of great pain, froth foaming through clenched teeth. His entire body shook violently despite being curled up. The whole image was terrifyingly to behold.</p><p>Onoki dropped beside Naruto and gripped him with his strong grip. He shook him hard but not violently to rouse him.</p><p>"Naruto. Wake up. It's just a dream. Wake up." Over and over he repeated the words, trying desperately to break through to his subconscious.</p><p>Naruto still refused to be drawn out from his imagined hell. His body was now a mass of flesh spreading across an unseen floor. An unbearable heat filled the air as parts of the mass burst into flame. Searing pain filled his mind as his silent screams went unheard, the smell of burning flesh all around him.</p><p>Kyuubi refused to abate its assault on the seal. If Naruto's mind broke he would fall into insanity, dragging the fox with it.</p><p>Onoki also continued to rouse the boy. It was plain to see that he was suffering some horrificly violent image in his dreams. He grew desperate, resorting to a more forceful shake.</p><p>"Naruto!"</p><p>Kurotsuchi was standing in the corner of the room. She had heard Onoki's desperate words and decided to investigate. Simple curiosity had exposed the girl to what lay before her. Her eyes were wide as fear gripped her. She had been told Naruto had a hard life so far, but seeing him like this scared her deeply.</p><p>"N-nii-san?"</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto's hell was continuing to drag him down into its depths. Each second brought a more horrific sensation. He couldn't take anymore.</p><p>"N-nii-san?"</p><p>That single, halting word broke through to him. One of concern, fear, worry. He hadn't really heard the word before today, not to him anyway. He knew what it meant, he had heard others address their family with it.</p><p>Brother.</p><p>He knew he hadn't any family of his own, this had to be Kurotsuchi. His new family. The Tsuchikage was his own Jiji, Kurotsuchi his nee-chan. They may not be of his blood, or even from the same village as him, but they were family. They had taken him in where no one else would. It had only been a few hours but they both had shown more care and concern than anyone else in the five years he has lived.</p><p>Nii-san. Brother. His sister was worried, calling to him. Begging him to come to her. Naruto didn't know much about being a brother, but he knew he had to try.</p><p>Like a veil lifting from his vision, his nightmarish dreams faded. He woke slowly from his deep sleep.</p><p>Kyuubi noticed the shaking had stopped, but it knew it hadn't been the cause of it. Something had calmed Naruto in a way the fox couldn't, the seal might have had something to do with it. It relaxed within the cage, still wary in case this calm wasn't permanent.</p><p>Onoki watched as the boy became still, all traces of his fit slowly fading. Kurotsuchi approached them both, kneeling beside her grandfather.</p><p>"Nii-san?"</p><p>Onoki placed a comforting arm around the girl, both watching as the newest addition to their family began to wake.</p><p>His eyes opened slowly, registering two blurred faces before him. Instinctively he braced himself for the beating that usually followed. Onoki placed a hand on his shoulder.</p><p>"It's all right Naruto. You're safe here."</p><p>The blonde recalled where he was a second later. He dropped his makeshift defensive stance and looked into the faces of his family. Tears formed in the corners of his eyes.</p><p>"N-nee-chan, Jiji."</p><p>The first few words uttered by the boy since he was given his room, ones addressing his family. Onoki smiled before pulling the boy into a reassuring embrace, Kurotsuchi joined in as well. Both trying to comfort Naruto as best as they could.</p><p>Said blonde just sat where he was while his family embraced him. He wasn't used to such contact but found it reassuring. Slowly he returned the gesture, making sure to include both his Jiji and his nee-chan. A small smile formed on his lips.</p><p>Within the seal the Kyuubi had sufficiently altered the seal to get a glimpse of Naruto's mind. It saw the dreams he had moments ago and the current state of his physical body. A sigh of relief escaped it seeing him taking comfort from those around him as they provided it. It didn't know how he had gotten into this situation so the fox began to review the boy's recent memories for itself, seeing as it now had limited access to those.</p><p>Naruto broke off a little, the other two backing off to see him properly. He looked between them both, eyes not fixing on either for more than a few seconds.</p><p>Onoki replaced his comforting hand on his shoulder. "Are you all right now Naruto?"</p><p>He nodded. "Yes Jiji."</p><p>Kurotsuchi shuffled next to him and brought him into a brother-sister hug. "Nii-san!"</p><p>Naruto returned the hug. "Nee-chan."</p><p>Onoki smiled at the two children. This is the life Naruto should be living. He had given the boy this chance, seeing it work before him made him feel good about himself. He had also given his granddaughter someone else in life to keep her company.</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><p><b>A/N: Chapter 5. Review anwering time:</b></p><p><b>'Aki Sou' - Thanks for pointing that out. Google didn't yeild me much love before but I think I'm correct in saying that younger brother is 'otooto-san'? Google says so but please correct me if I am wrong with the right terminology, and any future ones I get wrong...</b></p><p><b>'crimsontaicho' - Pairings and 'lemons' (I hate that word) will not be disclosed until if/when they happen, I feel they ruin the flow if people expect that content and rush forwards just to see it. The speed is there for a reason, too many people skip most of Naruto's childhood and miss out on a great deal of oppourtunities or character development. There are time skips planned for this (one being in the next chapter by the way) but they don't miss out on much so I can use the chances I get to detail the changes in more subtle steps. As for emotional drama, isn't mass rape enough? Yes there are more events lined up just like every other story, but at least for now I want Naruto to get a but happier before anything else gets fired at him. God-like Naruto and/or any kind of harem is entirely out of the question. Older women also. I am a loyal person when it comes to relationships and the mere thought of a harem just makes me cringe. Older women are just wrong at his age and set up, and I can't disclose if he has a relationship or not or who with because it's a major spoiler.</b></p><p><b>'Guest' (please use a more unique name so I can address you more directly)- Yes it is gruesome but not original. Many people have used some of what I have written before, I just amped it up by a fair bit to bring Naruto down to a very low point to justify his resultant actions of leaving Konoha for Iwa.</b></p><p><b>'Ryden Purrson' - I feel rape is used a fair bit in Naruto fan fictions but the scale of the emotional damage is severely negated. I wanted to reinvent the meaning behind it all and draw in readers to exactly how Naruto <i>should</i> be feeling about the ordeal. I think I managed to justify how it all worked in a convincing manner, those Jutsu can do strange things...</b></p><p><b>Everyone else who reviewed, I haven't forgotten you. Your reviews were just praise of one form or another and I can't reply to those without sounding like I'm stroking my ego...</b></p><p><b>But as I said before, I need help here. As 'Aki Sou' pointed out about my terminologies, there are discrepencies with my knowledge. Iwa character names is another area. I only know of Onoki and Kurotsuchi (her parents are dead in this so I could use Onoki as a Sarutobi replacement in naruto's life) and as a result I'm already creating OCs to fill the various roles. Please, I beg of you all, send me something about Iwa characters so I can reduce the OC numbers. Naruto wikis don't yield anything except the ones I have already used.</b></p><p><b>Wow, long Author's Note here... But again thanks to all my reviewers/followers, and to all using Guest accounts to review: change the name to something unique so I can respond more accurately in future to your questions/comments.</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The Life of the Hunted</p><p>Chapter 5</p><p>Naruto stood overlooking the village. Standing on top of the roof to his home gave him a great view of all that lay beneath his vision. It had been a week since he had shuffled through those gates into Iwa, a week since he had been given a home with his new Jiji and nee-chan. A slight smile tugged at his lips, he had a family.</p><p>"Nii-san? You up there?"</p><p>Kurotsuchi's voice drifted up to him. He dropped down through an open window to see his sister standing in his room, facing the window he had used to get to the roof.</p><p>"Hi nee-chan."</p><p>She tapped her foot slightly. "I've been looking for you for like ages! Jiji said not to climb out the window."</p><p>Naruto rubbed the back of his head guiltily. "Sorry nee-chan. I just like the view."</p><p>Kurotsuchi sighed, in a strange way for a five year old girl. "Jiji wouldn't like it if you fell Naruto."</p><p>"I know, I said sorry."</p><p>She pouted. "So when are you going to play with me nii-san?"</p><p>Naruto blinked in confusion. "Play? What's play?"</p><p>Kurotsuchi faltered visibly. "You don't know how to play?" He shook his head. "Come on, I'll show you!"</p><p>She grabbed Naruto's hand and rushed him out of the room into the lounge. He had no say in where he was being led, she was slightly older than him and he was still fairly weak after his treatment in Konoha.</p><p>She stood him in the center of the room. "Now, we will play tag. All you have to do is touch me and say tag, and not get touched by me. Just don't run around too much, Jiji won't be happy if we broke something." Naruto nodded in understanding when Kurotsuchi tapped his shoulder and jumped back. "Tag!"</p><p>"Wha- that's not fair! I wasn't ready!"</p><p>Kurotsuchi gave him a cheeky wink. "Come tag me then nii-san!"</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Onoki returned to his home for lunch as he had been doing since Naruto joined his family. He wanted to be sure he was settling in without any issues.</p><p>Iwa had already been informed of his arrival, and his current living situation. Their reactions were expected, a lot of unrest had rippled through the crowd until the Tsuchikage had explained his stance towards Konoha and his own parents. That had calmed them down, but there were still signs of unease.</p><p>Those signs had reduced over the week, most people seemed curious of Naruto more than weary now. Possibly the thought of having the jinchuuriki of the nine tailed fox as an ally had swayed them. He had been advised to nudge Naruto towards the academy for ninja training. Onoki didn't want to force the blonde into anything, but he would see if he took any interest in the idea.</p><p>Sighing and shaking the thoughts from his head he opened the door to his house, just in time to see Kurotsuchi fly past with a determined Naruto in pursuit.</p><p>"You're not being fair nee-chan!"</p><p>Kurotsuchi just giggled as she ran from the boy, unaware of Onoki standing in the doorway.</p><p>Clearing his throat got their attention, stopping them in their tracks. "Kurotsuchi, Naruto, what's going on?"</p><p>Kurotsuchi smiled. "We are playing tag Jiji. I had to teach Naruto how though."</p><p>Onoki was thankful he had a laid back stance towards raising his grandchild, that had extended to Naruto as well. "I see. Well then, as long as you're careful you may continue. I'll make lunch for us, should be ready in a few minutes."</p><p>"Thanks Jiji!" Kurotsuchi beamed before racing away again.</p><p>"Nee-chan!" Naruto wined before giving chase.</p><p>Onoki smiled to himself as he walked through to begin lunch. Seeing Naruto active for once was reassuring. He often returned home to find him shut in his room, Kurotsuchi had been worried about this as well. But slowly he had begun to open up, starting conversations and generally seeming more alive. The change was welcome especially for his granddaughter.</p><p>He shook his thoughts again as he prepared the food.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"Hokage-sama!"</p><p>Sarutobi jumped at the call. There was urgency in the tone. He turned to see Bear appear in his office.</p><p>"What is it? Have you found the weapon?"</p><p>Bear gulped. "We have, but that's the problem." There was a slight pause. "He's in Iwa."</p><p>Sarutobi's eyes widened. "What? How has he left the village without detection?"</p><p>"He didn't, two guards recalled seeing him leave two weeks ago but thought nothing of it. They don't remember seeing him return."</p><p>Sarutobi gripped the desk so hard it began to splinter. "Bring me the two guards. Take a team and get our weapon back, no excuses!"</p><p>"But Hokage-sama, that risks open war."</p><p>Sarutobi scowled. "They have a member of my village, my property. It is them who are risking war, not I. Get him back now!"</p><p>Bear bowed. "Yes Hokage-sama."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Four ANBU approached the border between Konoha and Iwa, bearing the symbol of fire country. Four more ninja were awaiting their arrival, these bearing the earth country insignia. A tense standoff formed between the two groups before a Konoha ANBU spoke.</p><p>"You have something that belongs to us. Return it."</p><p>An earth ninja scowled in response. "It? I assume you speak of the newest resident to Iwa." The ANBU nodded slightly. "For the record, <i>he</i> approached us of his own free will and asked for a home. We have not taken anything from you, so we have nothing to return."</p><p>The ANBU unsheathed their weapons. "The weapon is property of Konoha."</p><p>"<i>Naruto</i> is a resident of Iwa. He is not a weapon, he is a child. Now kindly leave before you risk a war you cannot win."</p><p>"What makes you so sure of that?"</p><p>Another earth ninja snorted. "Your numbers have lessened since the attack. And should Naruto be given the choice he will fight for Iwa. We have given him the things no one in Konoha did. A family. A home. A life." A sneer followed the words. "What makes you think he will fight for a village who gave him all those scars, physical and mental?"</p><p>The ANBU were left without words. Each one knew about Naruto's treatment in Konoha, the horrors he was exposed to on a daily basis. No one had stopped them happening. Was this the price they paid for their mistreatment?</p><p>Unable to find a counter argument they left, heading back to report to the Hokage.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>"Nee-chan!" A long wine echoed through the house. Naruto was tired now, Kurotsuchi hadn't allowed him to tag her once before or after dinner. It was starting to get late as well. Kurotsuchi however was just as energetic as ever, Naruto still hadn't fully recovered from his previous ordeals.</p><p>A cheeky giggle drifted to him from his sister, a dark mop of hair just visible around a corner. Naruto knew that the moment he stepped towards her she would take off again, whizzing around the house far too fast for him in his state.</p><p>"Nee-chan, I'm tired..." He allowed his eyes to droop for proof, he had been forcing them open for a half hour already.</p><p>"Lazy more like. You're too slow nii-san!" Kurotsuchi's mocking voice called back.</p><p>Naruto decided to admit defeat, only to himself, as he turned away and went to his room. Kurotsuchi followed carefully, in case he was trying to trick her, but was quickly disappointed when he closed the door behind him. She heard no more from him then. Just like every other time he went to sleep, once that door was closed Naruto was silent.</p><p>She sighed and went back to the lounge, resigning to play by herself until Onoki returned.</p><p>Naruto though was asleep, but not how anyone expected him to be. He hadn't used a bed before coming to Iwa, hence he didn't know quite how to use it. He did know that sheets and other items were good for preserving warmth though. He had climbed into the pile of bedding he had stuffed into a corner of the room, he also knew corners were safer than anywhere else, and pulled the opening he used shut.</p><p>Wrapped up within the pile Naruto had allowed himself to drift off. Now he was floating in the realm of dreams. There were two halves to this realm. The half that held all the pleasant dreams, ones you would want to remember forever, and the half that held all the unpleasant ones. These could be simple fears or slight scares, or absolute hell within your own head. Several factors influenced these nightmares, Naruto's life so far had pushed his dreams for down the hellish scale. Each night now was plagued with the horrors from the deepest pits of his own imagination, some being grotesque mutations of previous events that his mind made seem countless times worse.</p><p>Each night Naruto struggled within himself, his nightmares causing great damage to his mental health. He may have been away from the enemies in Konoha, but now his greatest threat was himself. Or rather his mind.</p><p>Kyuubi was privy to these dreams now. After the first few the fox had managed to manipulate the seal further, allowing it to see the dreams Naruto had. They didn't bother the fox, but it saw how Naruto reacted to them. Further work was rushed on the seal until now when the demon fox could enter those dreams and influence them. That night was the first time Kyuubi did so.</p><p>Naruto was once again in a hell of his own creation. Flames licked all around his body, searing pain flaring through him. He tried to scream but his vocal chords were burnt away, painful rasps the only noise he could make. He watched the flames burn higher when they suddenly extinguished themselves, a cool breeze washing over him. The air soothed his body as his injuries vanished. Turning around to face the breeze he saw a figure, or rather a shape with nine flowing tails.</p><p>"Kyuubi?"</p><p>The voice of Kyuubi echoed all around him. "It is I Naruto. I have managed to enter your dreams after considerable work on the seal. Sleep now, I will watch over you. Nothing can harm you while I am with you."</p><p>Naruto felt his dreams become calm, lulling him into a restful sleep. His mind emptied everything except himself and Kyuubi. He couldn't seem to remove the fox, as if he had no control over it. Kyuubi was really there, not a part of his dreams.</p><p>A smile formed on his lips, both in his mind and on his physical body. He drifted into a deep sleep, the first one of his life so far.</p><p>Kyuubi watched Naruto as he slept, warding off the evils of his own imagination. It stood vigil over the blonde, all nine tails sheltering him within his mind. They were soon back in the seal, those bars surrounding the fox again. But it didn't care about that. Naruto needed comfort during his sleep, Kyuubi would be there when no one else could. The fox couldn't prevent the smile from slowly creeping onto its lips as it watched the boy. It could finally make a difference to his life.</p><p>But there was still so much left to do. The seal needed so much more work. Kyuubi wished to communicate with Naruto without drawing him into the seal itself. It wished to view the world through his eyes, smell through his nose and hear through his ears. Taste his food as he ate and feel the warmth of the home he had. So much was left to do, each day seemed like another wasted chance to help Naruto. Progress was slow, but it was still progress.</p><p>For now though, Naruto could rest peacefully. Kyuubi had seen to that. It was a start.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Onoki returned home for dinner. He noticed the quiet house as he entered. Kurotsuchi was in the lounge alone, Naruto's door was closed. Onoki sighed.</p><p>"Hi Jiji!"</p><p>He smiled at her. "You been behaved Kurotsuchi?"</p><p>She nodded. "Yes Jiji. Naruto's gone to sleep though. I don't think we will see him until tomorrow. He got tired of tag I think." There was a dejected tone to her voice.</p><p>"Perhaps you're too fast for him at the moment. Don't forget that he has had a difficult life before coming here, he's not as fast as he could be at his age."</p><p>Kurotsuchi nodded slowly. "I just want nii-san to get better Jiji."</p><p>Onoki patted her shoulder. "We both do Kurotsuchi. We <i>all</i> do."</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><p><b>A/N: Right, here we go. This marks the first OC to enter the story. I don't know of anyone else for this role so I'm going to have to roll with it. Just so you all know, the pronunciation of the name is: Ye - roo - gee - oh Naj - a - ma - ki. You'll see who it is in the first section.</b></p><p><b>Also, I feel it's worth mentioning that I'm working with NoirRenamon on this to keep things moving. My knowledge on Naruto isn't the strongest ever but I'll be damned if I let my work suffer as a result. If anyone else wants to offer/suggest/help with this, feel free to contact me and I'll see what we can set up.</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The Life of the Hunted</p><p>Chapter 6</p><p>Naruto walked down the road feeling very excited with the day he had ahead of him. It had been three months since he had first come to Iwa and found a family to call his own.</p><p>During this time he had become close with his Kurotsuchi and Onoki, been introduced to the various people of note within Iwa and been offered a position in the academy, where he was now heading for his first day. He may be exited, but deep within himself sat a massive pit of worry and apprehension. What if the people there didn't like him? What if they felt he shouldn't be a ninja because of where he was from or what he was? He hid his anxiety with a happy smile.</p><p>Kyuubi wasn't as excited though. Over the same time it had made next to no progress in any area of its desires. The seal was far stronger than it first thought. The interactions in Naruto's dreams had increased to the point where he no longer needed protection from himself, Kyuubi was proud to have played a part in that, but he still needed to be in front of the cage for the fox to talk to him. His senses weren't as stubborn though, Kyuubi could now sense slight sensations when Naruto did. Slight hints of smells and sounds, the faint signs of touch and taste. Sight was non existent at the moment, but in due time that would change.</p><p>But today was Naruto's day. The day he started, hopefully, training to be a ninja. On the outside he was an ordinary boy, his blonde hair blue eyes combo would catch many eyes of females in a few years. But inside, as most people knew now, there was a fragile frame holding a powerful demon. No one knew of the stance between Naruto and Kyuubi, but either way there was a lot of power inside his small body. He never did recover from his ill treatment, his growth stunted and his form still thin. Not the 'eye pleasing' thin, the 'unhealthy' kind of thin. His bones were too visible under his skin.</p><p>Naruto entered the academy, after being shown where to go, and stepped into the room he was assigned to. Inside were many children of a similar age to himself, already seated and looking at him. His anxiety took over with so many eyes studying him, His excitement fading into nothing. Somehow he regretted coming here already.</p><p>"Ah, you must be Naruto." The blonde's attention was diverted to the older ninja at the front of the class. "I will be your sensei for your duration here, for all of you that is. If you would like to take a seat I will introduce myself as a whole and we can begin."</p><p>Naruto nodded jerkily and scanned the room briefly. He spotted an empty seat with no one else nearby and took it. He was still weary of others, even now. He took this moment to study his sensei.</p><p>He stood about five foot five, average height apparently, with cropped black hair and brown eyes. His face was unremarkable save for the slight scar that drew a line from his left eye down his cheek. He wore a standard attire for Iwa, red clothing with a brown flak jacket over the top. He also wore mesh armour around his ankles to protect them, though from what Naruto didn't know. His head band sat around his forehead proudly.</p><p>"Right, now that we are all here we can begin. As I said just now I am your sensei for your time here. My name is Yerugio Najamaki, but Yerugio-sensei is most appropriate. Now, let us begin. The first thing to learn about being a ninja is the nature of Chakra, the power within yourselves..."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Onoki was getting tired of this. Yet again Konoha spies had been caught close to Naruto, his grandson in all but name and blood, and trying to abduction him for return to their village. The place that treated him as a tool for their own uses. Onoki still had no specific information on what life Naruto had there, but given the scars and the way he was in the early days in Iwa he really dreaded knowing. Somethings were better left unsaid. See the signs and fix the problem, leave the causes be.</p><p>He issued an ultimatum this time though, should another Konoha ninja be caught within Iwa grounds, their head will be returned to whence they came. The body a day or so after. Onoki couldn't make it any clearer.</p><p>He dismissed his ANBU with his orders and returned to other matters.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Sarutobi also wasn't having a good time. He had lost his weapon to his most hated rival and had nothing to fall back on. Konoha was recovering well from the Kyuubi attack but without the vessel within the walls he felt weak. And there was another problem.</p><p>She needed to know.</p><p>He knew that once word reached her he was in for a grilling. He sighed as he sent for his ANBU to deliver the message. Bear appeared soon after being summoned.</p><p>"Hokage-sama?"</p><p>Sarutobi sighed again. "I need you to deliver a message to someone." Bear became quizzical about being used as a message runner until Sarutobi continued. "The message concerns the current status of the weapon, all details to be disclosed, to her."</p><p>"Her? With all due respect Hokage-sama, you can't be serious. If she found out-"</p><p>"<i>When</i> she finds out you mean. We have kept this from her for too long. Perhaps she can offer a new light on how to retrieve the weapon, some unexplored angle to exploit."</p><p>Bear still protested. "Hokage-sama, you heard the ultimatum. Any further attempts to retrieve him will result in us losing ninja. Iwa have so far released all of our ninja alive, but if we continue we will be receiving corpses."</p><p>"Which is why we need a new approach. Deliver the message, she will likely return with you so we can discuss this properly." Sarutobi gained a calculating glint in his eyes. "We <i>will</i> retrieve our property, one way or another."</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto sighed as he got back home. His first day had been tough but thoroughly enjoyable. He found the other kids disturbing, they just sat and watched him from a distance throughout the entire day. He felt uncomfortable and, despite enjoying himself with what he learnt, wasn't looking forward to going back. But he decided to stick with it for as long as possible, until he either passed or failed the exams or was asked to leave the academy.</p><p>He was also very tired, learning about the origins of chakra was a taxing ordeal.</p><p>He entered the home to see Kurotsuchi waiting for him. She had that same smile she wore when she wanted to play, but Naruto wasn't in the mood today.</p><p>"Hey nii-san! You gonna play tag with me now?"</p><p>Naruto shook his head. "No nee-chan, I'm tired. I'm going to bed."</p><p>And without another word he trudged into his room, closing the door behind him. Kurotsuchi followed him with her eyes, depressed that she couldn't play with Naruto again. She hadn't been able to do much with him over the three months he had been living there with her and Onoki. She had been told repeatedly about his previous treatment and how he had yet to recover properly.</p><p>His sleeping patterns had only recently calmed down to allow him to rest properly, but he still wasn't eating right. Food was never around him for very long as he crammed what he could into his mouth, only succeeding in making himself sick and bringing it all back up again. He still did this even now, after being told repeatedly about it. Some habits were hard to break.</p><p>She sighed and returned to the lounge, resigning to wait for Onoki to keep her company.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto found himself in his mind again, standing before the cage Kyuubi was held in. Said fox was staring at him as usual, a steady amount of the beast's chakra flowing around it. Again this was all normal for the fox, Naruto had seen this since he had first appeared here.</p><p><b>"Naruto. How went your first day?"</b> Kyuubi knew of Naruto's activities since the boy shared them regularly. That and it had access to his memories now, although it felt it more polite to ask than simply rummage through his mind. It also made conversation, and getting Naruto to talk was always a good thing.</p><p>Naruto didn't seem as happy as Kyuubi thought he would be though. "It was... Okay, I guess."</p><p>Kyuubi looked very surprised. <b>"Only okay? You were excited when you told me the first time. And the second, third... Forth..."</b></p><p>"I get it Kyuubi. I was excited..."</p><p><b>"But?"</b></p><p>Naruto sat in the icy water, ignoring his own discomfort. "I don't know. The other kids didn't seem... Happy, that I was there. As if they don't want me to be a ninja." Kyuubi saw his distress and wrapped him with a tail, lifting him out of the water and bringing him level with an eye.</p><p><b>"It's logical for them to be weary Naruto. They likely know of who you are, what you are and as a result they likely know of me. If you were a normal child, wouldn't you be even slightly cautious about someone who just appeared one day with a powerful demon sealed within them?"</b> Kyuubi felt like it was exaggerating its own power slightly, but it knew it was strong. The nine tails proved that.</p><p>Naruto nodded slowly. "I guess so... But it's not like I look scary, do I Kyuubi?"</p><p>The fox suppressed a look of amusement, slightly. <b>"Only if you want to be Naruto. But no, at the moment you don't look scary. But I am a demon and not much scares me anyway."</b></p><p>Naruto looked interestingly at Kyuubi. "What does scare you Kyuubi?"</p><p>Said fox was taken aback by such a question. Normally that question wouldn't be answered, but the fox had grown close to the boy. And if it meant prolonging their conversation then the fox could accept that small price. <b>"Uh, not much. Shinigami, the death god, definitely has a scary sense about it, it sealed me after all. Snakes aren't pleasant, although there aren't any big enough to threaten me even if I want sealed. I think that's about it." </b>It didn't add the part about Naruto's death though, that <i>did</i> scare Kyuubi. For his death meant the fox's death, a death laced with the failure of protecting him.</p><p>Naruto nodded. "I don't like snakes either." He shuddered within the tail. "What should I do Kyuubi? If the others don't want me there and ask me to go, what do I do?"</p><p>Kyuubi sighed. "I cannot answer that Naruto. You can only do what you feel is best. I can guide you but I can't make decisions for you. Those are yours to make and yours alone."</p><p>Naruto yawned as his exhaustion reached his mind. He was just as tired mentally as he was physically. "Then what would you suggest?"</p><p>Kyuubi smiled again. "I suggest that you get some rest. Answers may come in the morning, if not then I will think on it."</p><p>Naruto nodded sleepily and settled against Kyuubi, the fox laying him down on another tail and wrapping him up with the first. It watched the boy as he slept, just like each night since it had gained access to his dreams. That same smile crept onto its lips as it warded off the evils again, although there was substantially less to defend Naruto from these days. His mind was calming day by day, soon he could sleep peacefully without the fox's intervention.</p><p>Kyuubi wished for that day to arrive sooner rather than later.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Sarutobi waited for his guest to arrive. He had seen Bear arrive with her in tow, as he had expected. Now he was counting down the remaining seconds until they reached his office.</p><p>Three... Two... One...</p><p>A knock on the door sounded just as Sarutobi braced himself, the timing was spot on. "Enter."</p><p>Bear stepped in along with her. Sarutobi had to fight not to be intimidated by the heated gaze she wore. Her eyes blazed with anger, he knew why.</p><p>"Hokage-sama." Bear bowed to him before dismissing himself from the room.</p><p>"Sarutobi, I am very disappointed in you." A voice like steel grated across his hearing. This wasn't going to start well.</p><p>"There were... Complications that we-"</p><p>"I don't care! We had an arrangement, one you grossly failed to keep." He flinched at her words. He may be the Hokage of Konoha but she still scared the crap out of him. "Now, pray tell me how you plan on fixing this situation."</p><p>Sarutobi just shook his head lightly. "I was hoping you would have a better idea than me. I am no strategist"</p><p>That seemed to only annoy her further. "And yet you lead a village of ninja. You Sarutobi are a disgrace!" He flinched again. "I assume all you have done is repeatedly send ninja forwards into Iwa?" He simply nodded, dreading her next words. "Then you really are useless. How would that solve anything?"</p><p>"It was all I had-"</p><p>She slammed her hands against his desk. "Pathetic! How dare you call yourself Hokage!" Murderous intent flooded across to him before it subsided suddenly. "It seems I have to clean up after you yet again."</p><p>Shakily he found his voice. "How? What do you have in mind?"</p><p>"You are going to make amends with Iwa, fix the relationship bridges you burned and get on their good side again." She cut off his protests. "You will then offer to test their ninja at the chunin exams that will be held here on our next cycle. Should Iwa use the weapon themselves then it will attend, giving you a chance to retrieve it. Should they not, then Iwa will be lightly manned and taking it will be easy. <i>That</i> is your only chance Sarutobi, mess it up and your life is forfeit."</p><p>Sarutobi nodded, he could only agree now. He had no other choice. He lifted his gaze to look at her, face set in a serious expression.</p><p>"It will be done, Kushina."</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><p><b>A/N: Chapter 7. Appologies for the late update, I was out and didn't have the chapter ready for posting until after I got back.</b></p><p><b>'ero-sennin56' - I agree that Kushina is similar to the other fics out there, but here's the thing. Canon Kushina doesn't control Konoha through Sarutobi like mine does, and there are other things that will be different/not used before. If you want to see a story where she cares for Naruto then there are plenty out there like that. I myself have read a dozen like that.</b></p><p><b>'denmawarlight' - I appreciate that Kyuubi has been viewed as a male in Canon, but that isn't a confirmed gender. All my sources refer to the fox as 'it' and not 'he' or 'she'. I can't justify a sentient being of that power being genderless, and a male Kyuubi doesn't work with my plot. I am also a fan of FemKyuubi stories (hence 'The Mishap' and 'The Last Smile') so it's obvious that I will follow that trend. My appologies if you don't like that.</b></p><p><b>'bonkai2' - Consider your idea/advice used. That's a very valid point you have made and I will endevour to make sure I tick that box.</b></p><p><b>For everyone else, this chapter is a little fluffy, but one particular detail will be made as a major plot point for later. 'NoirRenamon' already knows this and has been virtually jumping around with excitement (citation needed) until I use it.</b></p><hr size=1 noshade><p>A Life Without a Legacy</p><p>Chapter 7</p><p>Five months passed with Naruto attending the academy. There was no improvement to how the others saw him, in fact he felt even more distant to them with each passing day. Kyuubi tried to alleviate his discomfort at being the centre of all the wrong attention, secretly hoping Iwa wouldn't turn on him like Konoha.</p><p>Kurotsuchi though had been the biggest boon for Naruto. After the first week of academy, when she found out of course, she had made Onoki place her with him. It gave her more time with her brother, the term becoming more solid despite the different lineage, and helped him through the tough times he had. Since she had joined him he had become notably happier, also receiving help from her on things he wasn't too sure of. She was the sister he could only dream of having. She too was happy knowing she could spend more time with Naruto.</p><p>However, this wasn't well received by Kyuubi. Yes it was happy that Naruto was getting along better, his previous treatment had horrified the fox to no end. But a sharp pang of jealousy came from the fox, yet again someone else had made Naruto feel better where Kyuubi couldn't. It gritted its teeth in annoyance, the seal had to go. Now.</p><p>Much youki was thrown around as the fox grew impatient with all the limitations.</p><p>Naruto though was unaware of his occupant and its current state. He was currently sat at home with Kurotsuchi as they memorised all they had learned so far, trying to prepare themselves for later studies.</p><p>It was October ninth now, one day short of another year since the Kyuubi attacked Konoha. The following day also held significance to one other individual in Iwa, although they didn't know it. Naruto's birthday.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Onoki had returned at the end of the day as usual to see Naruto and Kurotsuchi still studying. Naruto had stopped needing to sleep so much after the first month of being in Iwa, he was more normal now in his sleeping and eating patterns. Kurotsuchi had reduced how much time she spent trying to play with Naruto and instead devoted that time to learning with him. His understanding about Iwa and all things related to it had grown significantly.</p><p>Dinner was the usual affair, nothing too fancy but easily better than what Naruto had before coming to Iwa. Although he was used to the meals now. Another session of studying later and Naruto was in bed asleep, digesting both his meal and his new information that he had received that day.</p><p>Kyuubi though wasn't about to rest. It had taken far too long but at last the seal was almost ready. The fox left it be, after a quick modification, and decided to wait for morning. Hopefully Naruto would be in for a surprise when he woke.</p><p>It paced around, excitement and anxiety running through the fox with equal measure. It couldn't remember a time where it felt so much human emotion, yet Naruto was the source from where it all stemmed. It soon realised, through all their conversations and by seeing what he saw through his eyes, that there was a bond of sorts between the fox and the boy. One of friendship, companionship, and yet possibly more.</p><p>The fox of course knew Naruto may not take kindly to that level of attention, an all powerful demon taking any sort of interest in him would likely scare the hell out of him. But Kyuubi didn't know this emotion.</p><p>It knew that demons often took subjects for their own personal pleasure, passing time or simply as sadistic imitations of procreation, but Kyuubi didn't feel any of that. No desire to break him, no want to use him. Seeing how his life had turned out after all he had been through, for better and for worse, the fox was attached to him strongly. It would protect Naruto with its immortal life, defend him at all times no matter the odds. It would help him with all his problems, answer all his questions. Naruto was precious to Kyuubi, no one would take him from it.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>October tenth. The sixth anniversary of the attack on Konoha by Kyuubi. The sixth birthday of Naruto. Onoki had woken early along with Kurotsuchi and had both gathered outside his door. Kurotsuchi could barely contain herself, very low squeals of excitement escaping her lips despite Onoki's silencing looks. He too couldn't hide his smile though. He knew that Naruto had likely never celebrated his birthday before, today was going to change that.</p><p>Naruto was stirring now, waking up after a nice peaceful sleep. His dreams were a thing of the past, almost completely. A few still came to him but Kyuubi warded those away before they distressed him too much. He stretched and got dressed as usual before heading to his door. He paused when he heard a girlish squeak from the other side, Kurotsuchi must be planning on getting the jump on him. He smirked to himself, she had a long way to go to be stealthy enough to surprise him.</p><p>He shook his head, turning around and quietly climbing out the window.</p><p>Onoki and Kurotsuchi had heard him wake, any second now and he would open the door. Then they would surprise him.</p><p>Only Naruto wasn't in his room anymore. He shuffled along the outside of the walls and slipped through another window, this one in the lounge, and crept to the open door. He smirked again as he saw both Onoki and Kurotsuchi patiently waiting to jump on him as he opened his door, oblivious to the fact that he was now behind them.</p><p>Fight fire with fire...</p><p>Naruto leapt out behind them with a loud yell. Onoki fell over against the door, causing it to open, whereas Kurotsuchi just screamed in terror. She recovered quickly and whirled on the blonde.</p><p>"That's not funny nii-san!"</p><p>Naruto was laughing hard, something that has only begun to happen recently. "Really? I thought it was!"</p><p>By now Onoki had also recovered, torn between anger, amusement and amazement. Anger at being jumped out at, amusement at seeing Kurotsuchi's reaction, and amazement at how a six year old boy could sneak up on him like that. He settled for all three in equal measure.</p><p>"Naruto! How on earth did you get past us? You nearly gave me and Kurotsuchi a heart attack!"</p><p>"Easy Jiji. I could hear you from my room so I snuck into the lounge from the window." He was still laughing.</p><p>All three eventually composed themselves, Onoki getting to what he had planned from the start.</p><p>"Now Naruto. Do you know what today is?"</p><p>Said blonde thought for a second. "Saturday."</p><p>Onoki nearly fell over again. "What else is it?"</p><p>"Uh, the start of the weekend."</p><p>"And?"</p><p>"A day where we don't go to the academy?"</p><p>"And?"</p><p>Naruto paused. Was there something he wasn't seeing? "Uh... Um... Ah! I know! Today's the day where... Uh... Oh... I lost it... Um... Ah ha! Today's the day where you don't work in the office!"</p><p>This time Onoki did fall over, again. He rose quickly. "You really are clueless aren't you?"</p><p>Naruto shrugged as he hung his head. "Kyuubi thought so too."</p><p>Onoki's eyes widened. "Kyuubi? You've spoken to the demon?"</p><p>Naruto paused again. Perhaps he shouldn't have said that. "I, er, maybe?" Onoki didn't seem calmed by that. "It just wants to help me alright? It hasn't ever done me any harm, just the opposite. It helped me in Konoha more times that I can remember and its done the same here in other ways. Kyuubi is my friend."</p><p>Kyuubi, hearing the words through the boy's own ears, smiled widely. It wasn't a vicious smile, if you ignore the teeth, but one of gratitude and hope. Friendship was the first step towards its dreams.</p><p>Onoki's mouth worked for a few seconds before his voice caught up. "Well, I only have your word for that Naruto. But I trust it, if you say Kyuubi hasn't harmed you and is only helping then that's fine with me. Just promise me that you'll let me know in future, I don't like surprises."</p><p>"They make you fall over, don't they?"</p><p>Onoki just glared lightly. He cleared his throat. "Well, back to my question. You don't know what today is do you?" Naruto shook his head. "Today Naruto is the day the Kyuubi attacked Konoha."</p><p>"Uh, why does that matter Jiji? We don't like Konoha." He virtually spat the word.</p><p>"No we don't, but it also marks something else that happened on that day." Onoki paused to see Naruto's face become confused again. "Today, six years ago, was the day you were born Naruto. Today is your birthday."</p><p>Kurotsuchi squealed again, but both were drawn to Naruto's puzzled look face.</p><p>"Birthday? What's one of those?"</p><p>Onoki's heart sank. He really had been treated poorly in Konoha. Kyuubi was likewise affected, a single tear escaping a large eye. Kurotsuchi became silent, also not expecting such a question.</p><p>Onoki sighed. "It's a celebration of your birth that happens every year Naruto. People sometimes by gifts for it as well. I understand that your treatment in Konoha was severe, but I didn't think you didn't know about birthdays."</p><p>"Oh."</p><p>That was all Naruto could say on the matter. It hit him hard, knowing that the people of Konoha purposely ignored his birthday and hid it from him. He didn't know what to feel about it all. Anger for being ignored? Sadness for losing out? Or happiness for Onoki and Kurotsuchi appearing to take the time to change all that, trying to give him his first birthday. He could see that they were trying to do that, they wouldn't have brought it up otherwise.</p><p>Kurotsuchi hugged him from behind, giving a pleading look to Onoki. "But that's what we're here for, right Jiji? We're going to give nii-san his birthday!"</p><p>Onoki smiled at that. "Yes we are Kurotsuchi. Today and every year to come."</p><p>Naruto smiled, tears of joy threatening to form in his eyes. Kyuubi also smiled. If Naruto was that happy from just having a birthday, how happy could he be if the fox managed to succeed in its goals?</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto was subject to being the centre of attention, for all the right reasons, for the entire day. Everything revolved around him during his birthday. He chose what to eat, where to go and what to do. Never before had he had so much say in anything, so much choice in what went on. Iwa knew of his birthday, thanks to Onoki, and they too celebrated with him. A festival, adapted from the attack on Konoha that happened at the same time, was thrown in his honour. Yes Iwa was going to celebrate October tenth anyway, it's not every day that your most hated foe gets crippled by a giant demon fox, but Naruto's birthday became the new centre piece for it all.</p><p>Naruto had the time of his life. Despite how he felt about the academy and the responses he received from people, everyone seemed to want to join in with him. He met almost the entire village in one day. People shaking his hand, hugging him or just introducing themselves in other ways. He made many new friends as a result. Life was good, very good.</p><p>The evening saw the main piece of entertainment. A large display of fireworks that filled the sky from horizon to horizon, flashes of colour that were seen for miles around. Naruto gazed at through display with awe, he had never seen fireworks before. The whole of Iwa had joined in with the celebrations, giving the blonde haired boy a day to truly remember.</p><p>Now it was Kyuubi's turn.</p><p>It was time. Naruto had returned to his room after an eventful day, exhausted but feeling very happy. He laid in bed just as the seal began to weaken. It was now exactly six years since it was placed on the boy, the attack being at night, and the anniversary of its creation always weakened it a little. Kyuubi forced youki against the depleting seal, speeding along the process. Cracks formed within the seal, youki leaking through it.</p><p>Outside Naruto's body began to glow a deep red, youki wisping off him. The seal was glowing brightly under the sheets as something raised them off his body. A red mass condensed from the seal, tendrils poking from under the sheets Naruto had around him. Each tendril took form, four legs and nine tails. Another shorter tendril became a neck and head, two long ears on top. Two blood red eyes with slitted pupils opened to see Naruto sleeping. A toothy smile formed on its muzzle.</p><p>Kyuubi was free.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>Naruto woke feeling much heavier than usual. He could also hear breathing that wasn't his own. Had Kurotsuchi jumped on him again? He opened his eyes, but instead of seeing her black hair he saw red. Lots of red.</p><p>He blinked a few times as the red mass moved, a head swivelling to look at him. Blood red eyes gazed into his blue ones, recognition flooding through him despite his sleepy mood.</p><p>"K... Kyuubi?"</p><p>The fox nodded once. "Hush Naruto. It is me. I wish you no harm as you already know."</p><p>Naruto blinked. "Did I have another nightmare?"</p><p>Kyuubi laughed a little, guessing what he meant. "No Naruto. You are awake now. I am really here."</p><p>"Wha... You're free?" Naruto began to panic, unsure of the consequences of Kyuubi being out of the seal.</p><p>Kyuubi shook its head. "Not quite Naruto. I am still partly sealed and this is taking a lot out of me, I can't maintain this for long. But now at least we can see each other properly, with our own eyes. I can be by your side whenever you wish me to be."</p><p>Naruto struggled to wrap his head around what he was seeing. "So you're out of the seal, but still inside it?" Kyuubi nodded. "And you can't stay out for long?" Another nod. "Do we still get to be friends?"</p><p>"Of course Naruto, I would have it no other way. And now I can do this we can speak more often. You won't be alone anymore. I know you have your family and that you have made some friends from yesterday, but now I can stay with you as well. I will protect you Naruto, better than anyone else ever can."</p><p>Naruto smiled, hugging Kyuubi's neck tightly. "Thank you Kyuubi."</p><p>Kyuubi just smiled. "I know it's a day late, but happy birthday Naruto."</p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><p>A/N: Right, no update I'm afraid. Sorry to get your hopes up. I just wanted to let you all know that I won't be updating for a little while due to sleep deprivation. I have tried time and time again recently to put words down and haven't succeeded. I have a half written chapter for 'Quantum Displacement Theory' and nothing else. I will come back though once I recover, updates will resume as normal as soon as I have finished content. I'm just really struggling at the moment to remain focused on anything except sleep.</p><p>Also, I wanted to draw you all to an anonymous review on 'The Life of the Hunted', sent by someone called 'DemonAndAGun'. It follows:</p><p>'You should quit writing. Just stop, you are absolutely fucking deplorable, if you want to do your thing, write your own fucking story and publish it, but quit trashing fanfic, you even stated in 'The Mishap' you were trying to make your own story, well do that, and get the Hell off Fanfic. You call yourself original and that you are trying to do things differently, you are in fact one of the most cliche writers out their hanging off the bandwagon, not to mention your theories make no sense. Naruto joins Iwa... been done a hundred times... Kushina abandoning Naruto... I'll give you her seeing him as a weapon is new but then there's one tiny problem... why in the Hell would Kushina want to do anything to benefit the village that abandoned HER village and HER clan to their enemies? The ONLY difference between this and other Kushina abandonment fics IS simply the fact that Kushina thinks of Naruto as a WEAPON and not the DEMON, but it is not enough to ride that nasty bitter aftertaste of clicheness out of my mouth. So do everyone on Fanfic a favor and stop writing for Fanfic, go write your own worthless garbage chocked full of your crappy OCs.'</p><p>Now, I don't really care if he/she reads this, but I will say it anyway.</p><p>I literally translated all that text into this: *Trollface* Yep, exactly that. So well done there mate, your review means absolutely nothing.</p><p>Why? Because it's very clear that you have NO idea how much work goes into fan fiction, just like any writing of any sort, and you appear to be about 8 years old. This is fan fiction, the author has complete free choice in what goes on in their stories, not some lame assed prick with no sense of anything. Not to mention that the 'facts' you put forward don't actually exist. Naruto joining Iwa hasn't been done before, and Kushina has't controlled Konoha either. Didn't it ever cross your small inferior mind why she does that? Don't you think it's her revenge from her husband, Minato, taking her only son away from her so she can destroy the very village he swore to protect? She lost her village and clan, wouldn't she see Konoha as a replacement if she could control it? Obviously your imagination isn't very large, otherwise you would have actually THOUGHT about things before acting like a complete tosser.</p><p>There is a major rule to everything you read on this site: Don't like it? Don't read it. Simple as.</p><p>I know my work isn't everyone's taste, that's fine by me. But if you don't like it, go find something else to read instead. You're just wasting your own time in writing that idiotic review, so well done again.</p><p>And by the way, request denied. I will continue to 'trash' fanfiction all I please simply because there are people who like my work. I will not stop just because you think you're better than everyone else and that your word is 'supposedly' law.</p><p>Rant over, all I can say is this: Well done for wasting your own time. I won't stop because of you, of you don't like it, piss off.</p><p>'Nuff said.</p><p>For everyone else, updates will resume as soon as I can finish the required content. I still have a fair few stories to post as well so I won't be going anywhere. Sorry 'DemonAndAGun', you'll just have to try and troll me again... And by the way... your review is being left up simply because it makes me laugh. Everyone else can laugh as well if they want.</p><p>Catch you all later... Have a good Christmas if you celebrate it.</p>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><hr><br><p>A/N: Another note here, but this one isn't so good.</p><p>I'm stopping my work on this fic. Why? Because I can't stomach the main series this stems from and writing about it is hard without knowing the main turning points I have to hit. It has nothing to do with that idiotic review (in case anyone's thinking that) but rather my own free will. I will continue to post my Digimon stuff for those who are reading both types of my work, but it gives me no pleasure to have my first abandonned fic right here. I try and try to see things through to the end but this is a no go for me. Unless people want me to completely abandon the Canon plot and strike out on my own then I see no way I can progress now.</p><p>Sorry to all involved but I can't work with the original Naruto storyline/plot/characters/anything else.</p><p>Edit: Due to recent reviews I have decided to bring this story back. Note that it may take some time to update but I will try to continue.</p>
