every one just a update on my stories. They have all been temporarily
disbanded. Now this does not mean I have given them up but till I
sort out my plotlines for the stories and get over my writers block
on them I can not continue my stories. But I do have 3 ideas for new
naruto stories. And one just so happens to be. Storm rider. And mane
theme is the bodies by disturbed plot is</P><P>--</P><P>What if
jarya trained naruto Before wave arc</P><P>What if
naruto died when jariya had thrown naruto over the cliff. And what
would happen if naruto was reborn the same day due to a fox's miss
intentions but indoing so the kyuubi greatly misgauged naruto's
potential creating a hell on two legs so to speak.</P><P>Watch
naruto as he slice's thru all enimes as he lets his mask fall.
Watch the aftermath of the maelstrom naruto creates whith his hatred,
rage sadness and sorrow</P><P>Powerful
naruto, Demonic naruto, Insane naruto, Semi Dark naruto, Split
Persona naruto</P><P>No
main pairings yet, harem demonic and normal, R rated for gore sexual
reference's rape attempts and reference's, suicide attempts and
reference's, sex scenes (lemons and limes) hardcore swearing
mutilation torcher and BDSM……..and spelling errors(bit of humour
in there lol) last but not least crued humour.<I><U><B>
If u are easily offended and/or under the age of 17 read at ones own
risk</B></U></I>. I own nothing but of my
own ideas and creations. Now let the games Begin</P><P>As Naruto fell deep in
to the dark riven, naruto digs deep to try and find the second chakra
but fails to reach in time, as naruto sees the ground coming up
faster and faster the last thing Naruto can think of before smashing
head first from the 3k drop is 'fucken hell'.</P><P>Jaryia
was getting pretty nervus about the fact nothing happened. No summons
no chakra of any kind. Getting worried he just killed his newest
student and son of his first minato, Jaryia he decides to check up on
naruto and hope the worst has not happened to his godson. But little
did he know what he sees down there will haunt his dreams for ever.</P><P>As
Jariya climes down the three kilometre crevice he spies the hunting
sight of his student, his god son that he was meant to look after broken on the dirt floor with a three meter stag-mite producing
thru his chest out his spine. Naruto's face was contorted in a face
of fear, pain and oddly sadness. Pushing thru thought that naruto did
live for a short while after the rock had penetrated thru him was
obsured. Looking upon Naruto's broken form he kneels closer to his
face and with tears forming in his eyes he wipes some of the blood
that leaked out of Naruto's mouth while mumbling "I am sorry I
was not there for you when you where younger and I am sorry I failed
you as a teacher and lastly I am sorry you will never be able to make
the people of konoha accept you. But I wont let them defile your
grave",.</P><P>With
of the utmost care Jariya lifted naruto of the rock, wincing at the
sqwanching and plopping sound of the rock removed form his flesh and
a few of his organs falling onto the ground. With Naruto's body
held within his arms bridal style he took off out of the raven
heading into training grounds 44 the forest of death. There know one
would be mad enough to enter just to deface ones grave.</P><P>"arrrrrrrrr
what the fucken hell happed, first if am falling then land on that
fucken sharp rock then next I am in this fucken hell hole of a sewer"
where the voiced thoughts of one blond child. Aloud roaring sound
could be heard thru out the halls attracting the attion of Naruto. As
he decides to investigate for the sore of the noise the further he
goes the more he notices the state of the walls, floor and ceiling
round him. More cracks where appearing the further he went. At first
they where spider line crakes then started getting bigger till the
point of he had to move around holes in the floor and dodge bits of
falling ceiling.</P><P>Once
naruto came upon a large cage that seam rusted and the metal bars
twisted around each other as if something broke out. Naruto notices a
peace of paper float up towards him. When he picks it up to see what
it was he just notice's the kanji for seal before getting flung
into a wall. As he landed limply as he slumped angst the wall he
chuckles, his attacker had the strangest thought as naruto's
chuckle turns into a full blown insane laughter <I><B>'what
is wrong with this one he laughs at a attack that would knock out a
stonger person, douse he like pain'</B></I>
his attacker never got to finsh its thoughts as naruto's voice came
thru.</P><P>"my
my if I am correct I just got hit by the kyuubi, would I be wrong"
as he looks up and confirms his suspicions as he gaze's at the nine
tailed fox with its teeth bared "well aren't you a pretty sight
all scary and shit" as naruto struggles to get up the fox lowers
its head and speaks in a deep menacing voice <I><B>"aren't
you scared puny human, do you not fear me the great kyuubi"</B></I>
<I></I>shaking
his head he gives out a deep sigh before saying "just do it" the
fox was stunned and asked what he meant receiving another insane
chuckle from the blond "arnt you going to kill me, you know its bad
manners to play with your food, come on you will be doing me a favour
as well ad the villagers as the only seem me as you". Once again
the fox was stunned not only this child was not afraid but it showed
no respect at all but not to mention his wish's for death but
before the fox could respond naruto spoke up again "well if your
not going to kill me how bout you kindly <B>FUCK
OFF</B>" at that moment naruto seemed to
be surrounded in a pitch black aurora of chakra before passing out
from the pain.</P><P>As
the kyuubi reverted back into human form, its body reshaped its self
into a drop dead gorgeous lady around the age of 21 that seamed to
give of a aurora of power and grace, she moves towards the unconsuis
child and pikes him up before whispering into his ear "I will allow
you to live as u keep me entertained" before she grabbed a hold of
naruto around his wast and vanished both into the maki. The kyuubi
would never realise it but at that moment she had the chance to stop
a child that would grow into the strongest being that has the power
that would even make kami fear going against, but yet gain allie for
all eternity and maybe even a lover.</P><P>Around
Naruto's grave stood four people. Anko, Kakashi, Jaryia and the
third hokage. All four had grim looks their face's as they looked
down at the grave. But thire silence was broken when Kakashi could be
heard asking "why". As the other three looked towards the man
that seems to be hiding large amounts of pain in his voice. "why"
he crocked out again but with anger building in his voice this time.</P><P>Jaryia
bowed his head in shame as he knew the question was aimed towards
him. He just could not bare to look Kakashi in the eye. But he knew
what was coming next and did not move away from the blow that was
comeing towards his face. When the blow connected Jaryia was laying
on the ground holding his sore jaw but before he could pull himself
up Kakashi was already crouched over him ready to deal another blow
to the old perverts nose.</P><P>Anko and
the third where stunned. Here was Kakashi that was normally level
headed and a tad lazy that seemed to now give off such A aurora of
hatred, rage, and bitterness. Most likely due to the sad irony of him
losing a potential student for his three man squad. That was holding
off its third member position for naruto. And yet he was over a down
Jaryia pummelling the mans face all the while screaming out 'why'.
Jaryia just spat blood ar Kakashi's face before shoving him off
before screaming at him.</P><P>"why
do you care Kakashi!! Last time I checked you ditch naruto onto me in
favour to train the uchiha. Tell me do you think I wanted naruto to
die. He was MY GODCHILD dam it. Did you know I caught him trying to
commit Suicide not once but Three times. Three Fucken Times! Tell me
Kakashi what would have made Naruto want to do this"</P><P>As
Kakashi, Anko and The Third looked stunned at this revelation but
only one could know of the reasons, one was able to speculate and the
other oblivious (A/N for the order read from third to kakashi)</P><P>"He
told me each time, that maybe the world would be better off with out
him. I asked him why he would say that. Do you know what he told me
Kakashi? he told me, no one would care if he died and that the
village would hold celebrations for his death. That not even the
children of the academy understood him due to the hate passed onto
them from there parents. That he wanted death on his terms not of
konoha's ninja's or villages. I asked him what he meant and he
told me, 'I can not remember how many times people have tried
killing me be it civilian or ninja there are just to many to count.' And did you know the worst part. When he told me this he had a smile
on his face. A fake smile but a smile none the less and those cold
lifeless eyes. I will never forget them so don't patronize me
Kakashi and I am ashamed on this village"</P><P>As Jaryia
finished his speech he vanished from sight leavening one stunned hokage thinking on how he failed naruto. One openly sobbing Anko and
anko never cries about anything in the open. And one stunned and
ashamed Kakashi that could not stop from crying. No how much he tried
Jaryia's words cut deep but worst of all he knew with all his heart
that what jaryia said was true and could not stop thinking of how he
failed naruto.</P><P>The
Third was the first to brake out of his stooper addressed the
remaining two still around the grave.</P><P>"Anko
Kakashi this must not become common knowledge. I have know doubt in
my mind what naruto said about the village celebrating his death will
become a reality so for the last think I can at least do is make it
so they don't tarnish his name or grave. From now on naruto is on a
long training trip with a indefinite return. Understand"</P><P>The two
could only nod as they parted from the grave site leaveing the hokage
to morn in privet.</P><P>The third
looked down at naruto's grave letting tears slowly fall down his
face. Before letting out a silent whisper into the winds "naruto I
am sorry I failed you I am sorry"</P><P>"<I>I am
sorry"</I></P><P>Naruto
awoke suddenly as he thought he heard something but looking around he
could only ask "where am I?" as he
looked at his strange environment but notices the siloet of someone
coming closer</P><P>Sorry
about leavening it in this cliff hanger but I must say its not
looking too good and before you ask naruto is not going to become a
Fox demon but more of a cross of a</P><P>Well I
wont tell you but read if you want to find out</P>
