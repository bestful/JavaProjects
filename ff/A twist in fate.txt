Naruto shouted out.</p><p>"If you insist…I'll allow you to take a C ranked mission. It's to escort a certain person." He said. Naruto grinned.</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Yes. I'll introduce him now." The Hokage said and raised his voice.</p><p>"Can you please com in now?" The door opened, and there stood an old man.</p><p>"What? They're all kids!" He protested. He took a dram from his sake-bottle, and leaned on the doorway.</p><p>"Is the smallest one here with the idiotic face really a ninja?" He said pointing at a certain blonde. Naruto's eyes widened.</p><p>"Can I kill him?" He mumbled.</p><p>"BAKA! Don't kill the man you're supposed to escort!" Kakashi said. The man sighed.</p><p>"I am the bridge building expert, Tazuna. Once I have returned to my country, I'll have all of you protecting my life with yours while I complete the bridge."</p><p><b></b></p><p><b>Outside the village, an hour later</b></p><p>Naruto was pissed. Kakashi was reading his stupid book. Sakura was harassing Sasuke, and the stupid, stupid, STUPID bridge-builder-expert-fool was just drinking.</p><p>Mile after mile. It was troublesome and slow to just walk. Naruto glanced around. He wanted to fight, damn it! The road was plain and simple. Not even a single trap! Some flowers, grass, there was a small puddle…</p><p>"<i>A puddle it hasn't rained in weeks this must be a trap" </i>Naruto thought</p><p>Suddenly the puddle changed into two men and wrapped a chain around Kakashi stopping him from moving, and another voice was heard.</p><p>"So the great copy cat ninja Kakashi has been caught" said the man</p><p>"You must be Momoichi zabuza the demon hidden in the mist" asked Kakashi.</p><p>"Yes your right but unfortunately I can't fight with you because I got other things to take care of, like killing this man."</p><p>Zabuza got his sword and ran at Tazuna at full speed.</p><p>"Naruto you're the closest I want you to stop him!" Kakashi shouted out</p><p>Naruto was scared and his body couldn't move and zabuza got the hit and Tazuna head was on the floor covered in blood and then zabuza grabbed Tazuna's head and told the two men who were referred to the demon brother to come back to the base.</p><p>End of flash back</p><p>"Ok I want everything else written down" asked the hokage</p><p>"Hokage-sama please do not blame Naruto for this it was his first high rank mission and we never got all the mission detail from Tazuna"</p><p>"Kakashi before you leave do you think your team is ready for the chunnin exams"</p><p>"Yes but they will need more experience" replied Kakashi</p><p>"Ok you may leave now"</p><p>Kakashi finished talking to the hokage and left.</p><p><b></b></p><p><u><b>With Naruto</b></u></p><p>"<b>You shouldn't let them treat you like that</b>" said the mysterious voice</p><p>"Who's t…there c…come out and s…show yourself" Naruto said with a quivering voice</p><p>"<b>Why don't you kill them"</b> said the mysterious voice</p><p>This time Naruto built up more confidence and shouted "Who are you! "</p><p>Naruto was running toward his house and quickly opened the door and then locked it.</p><p>"<b>There's no point trying to hide"</b> said the mysterious voice</p><p>"Were are you?" questioned Naruto</p><p>"<b>You really are dumb I'm in your mind"</b> said the mysterious voice</p><p>"Y…you're the kyuubi" Naruto said in a quivering voice</p><p>"<b>Maybe you aren't that dumb"</b> said the kyuubi</p><p>Naruto fell unconscious from the headache he got talking with the kyuubi.</p><p><b></b></p><p><u><b>In naruto's mind</b></u></p><p>Naruto picked himself up and he saw a huge hall which had drain pipes that were leaking and the floor was wet, Naruto walked down the hallway and found a room with a huge cage and then saw two huge red eyes string straight at him.</p><p>"<b>Human come here"</b> asked the kyuubi</p><p>Naruto got closer to the cage and then an explosion happened in the cage and got covered with smoke. Naruto saw a body that was the shape of a human and when all the smoke got cleared he saw a scantily clad woman dressed only in garments which could be described as an extremely modified kimono which showed all the curves. Naruto's face paled as he saw the nine tails sticking out of the kimono and the red eyes. The woman was currently standing against a massive cage which held her trapped Naruto was just staring at awe at the women who was supposedly the kyuubi no kitsune.</p><p>"<b>So tell me Naruto why do let all those people treat you like shit"</b> kyuubi asked</p><p>"Because…they are precious to me" Naruto replied back</p><p>Kyuubi was just laughing at the answer that Naruto gave her</p><p>"<b>so you say they are precious to you but they treat you like shit I can give you more power so they will acknowledge you, so do want that power"</b> kyuubi asked in gentle voice</p><p>"Hai" Naruto replied</p><p>"<b>Ok then come closer and you'll get all the power you want"</b> kyuubi said</p><p>Naruto walked closer to the cage were kyuubi was and stepped in and then kyuubi grabbed him with one of her tail and brought him closer to her then she pushed her lips against his and red chakra started to pour into Naruto.</p><p><b></b></p><p>Authors note: I hoped you liked this chapter the next one coming up soon and I want you to vote for pairing and remember RnR</p>

Sasuke replied</p><P>Sakura
just frowned, and after an hour later Kakashi showed up reading his
book.</p><P>"Kakashi

now go in to that clothe shop and get some new clothes"</B></p><P>Naruto
walked in the shop and started looking for some clothes and after
about half an hour he found he got all his clothes which consisted
black pants stopping at his ankles which were wrapped with bandages
covering up the ends of the pants. On his pants were numerous pockets
but only a few were seen. His shirt was now a tight fitting blood red
that was cut off at the sleeves and he had more bandages covering his
shoulders to about his elbows. His sandals were still the normal
sandals but were black and were made with a soft bottom so that it
would be easier to cover up his tracks Along with a black mask which
covered up his whisker marks so no one would recognise him and then
went to pay for everything.</p><P>"<B>Kit
now I want you to get some weapons"</B></p><P>Naruto
carried on walking and went inside another shop and found Tenten
behind the counter</p><P>"Hey
Tenten I never knew you worked here"</p><P>"Hey
Naruto, actually I'm just looking after the shop for a couple of
minutes because my dad has gone out so anyway what are you doing
here.</p><P>"I'm
looking for some weapons"</p><P>"Ok"</p><P>Naruto
looked around the shop and got 50 kunai, 30 shuriken, 2 katanas, some
exploding tags, smoke bombs and some weights for his arms and ankles,
when he paid for everything he said goodbye to Tenten and walked out
the shop.</p><P>"So
kyuubi-Chan is there anything else I need to get"</p><P>Kyuubi
smiled at the Chan Naruto ended her name in and replied <B>"yes I
need you to get the forbidden scroll it has some powerful Justus's
in there that will help you to get more stronger, and go home were
going to fake your death"</B></p><P>Naruto
ran home and went inside his house.</p><P>"<B>Kit
I'm going to teach you a jutsu its called blood explosion kage
bushin no jutsu"</B></p><P>"What
does it do?" Naruto questioned</p><P>"<B>It
makes a clone of your self and then explodes and splatters blood
everywhere so when Anbu or hunter Nins look for you they'll think
your dead"</B></p><P>After
20 minutes Naruto finally mastered the jutsu and timed it so when he
was 5 miles away from the village then it would explode.</p><P>Naruto
was in his new clothes and had all his weapons in his pockets and
pouches, he had his chakra weights on, and his katanas strapped on
his back. Naruto went out of his house and crept through the village
and got the forbidden scroll with out any trouble until he heard an
explosion.</p><P>Author's

now on with the story </U></B></p><P><U><B>in
the hokage tower</B></U></p><P>"Hokage-sama
there was an explosion in naruto's house and the Anbu have told me
he is dead!" shouted out one of the Anbu's</p><P>"I
want you to close all the gate so no one can get in or out and look
get an Anbu squad to find out who did this and kill them" the
hokage ordered</p><P>"We
should be celebrating that the demon brat is dead not looking for who
did it" the Anbu muttered</p><P>"What
was that?" asked the hokage</p><P>"Nothing"
replied the Anbu</p><P>"Ok
you can leave"</p><P><B><U>With
Naruto</U></B></p><P>"Kyuubi-Chan,
what am I suppose to do there's an Anbu guarding the gate?" asked
Naruto</p><P>"<B>Let
me take over"</B> said kyuubi</p><P>"No"
said Naruto</p><P>"<B>Kit
listen to me it's the only way your going to be able to escape for
here"</B> said kyuubi</p><P>"Ok
if I let you control me you have to let me have control once you're
out of Konoha" said Naruto</p><P>"<B>Fine
and while were escaping I'll have some fun with your body"</B>
said kyuubi with a smirk on her face which Naruto couldn't see</p><P>Before
Naruto could say anything he found himself in his mind.</p><P>"<B>Ok
now that I'm free I can get out of here but I'm only going to be
able to use the jutsu's Naruto has learned but I can use one of my
own"</B> said the kyuubi</p><P>Naruto/kyuubi
ran to the gate and jumped over it only to be stopped by an Anbu</p><P>"Stop
right there no one is supposing to gets out of this village"</p><P>Naruto/kyuubi
carried on running</p><P>"So
you must be the on that killed him, I would of thanked you for
killing the demon brat but the hokage told me to kill the person that
was responsible for it." Said the Anbu</p><P>"<B>Human you don't know who you're messing with here"</B>
Yelled Naruto/kyuubi.</p><P>Naruto performed some seals and Yelled <B>"Kage bushing no jutsu"</B></p><P>Instantly
ten clones appeared around Naruto, each removed a kunai from their
pouch and with that they charged at the Anbu.</p><P>The
Anbu was stunned that the person who he was fighting with was the
kyuubi but then smiled and whispered to himself "it looks like I'm
going to kill the demon after all"</p><P>The Anbu charged at the clones that were quickly approaching. Within
seconds they were tangled up in the heat of battle. The clones were
flipping and sliding at the Anbu from all directions while the Anbu
almost got hit by one of the clones. The Anbu turned and shouted out</p><P>"Katon:
Goukakyuu no Jutsu (Fire Release: Grand Fireball Technique)"</p><P>The
entire clone's disappeared and the real the real Naruto was mere
inches away from him. Naruto slammed his fist into the Anbu's face
and then followed it up by doing a back flip and catching the Anbu
under the chin with his foot. The Anbu went flying backwards head
over heals to land on his stomach several feet away. He slowly stood
up wiping the blood from his broken lip and laughed.</p><P>"That was a lucky hit demon At least I will get some amusement from
this fight."</p><P>With
the Anbu performed several seals and shouted out</p><P>"Katon: Karyuu Endan (Fire Dragon Flame Missile)"</p><P>Naruto/kyuubi
was quick to dodge the Jutsu and called on some reinforcements. After
performing the needed seals and saying the words once again he was
flanked by 20 Clones. 10 on either side the clones wasted know time
and got into battle position. They charged at the Anbu and began the
attack. One of the clones slid at the Anbu trying to knock him off
his feet while another jumped into the air to take him from above.
The Anbu Jumped above the first clone and spun in the air tagging
both clones and watching as they burst in a puff of smoke. He landed
on the ground and immediately parried an attack from another Clone
and hitting him on the back of the neck. In less then a minute all
the clones were gone and the Anbu laughed at Naruto/kyuubi.</p><P>"Is this the best you have for me Naruto/kyuubi? I really expected
more from a demon."</p><P>Naruto/kyuubi
was calm and created more clones. Naruto/kyuubi ran at the Anbu and
shouted out</p><P>"<B>We'll see whose laughing when this fight is over you
bastard." </B></p><P>The
battle continued like that for two more minutes.</p><P>Naruto/kyuubi
charged at the Anbu with his clones thinking that he was unaware of
his approach from behind</p><P>The
clone charged at him and shouted out</p><P>"<B>Fox
fire ball"</B></p><P>The
fire ball of demonic chakra went straight through the Anbu killing
him instantly.</p><P>"Hey
kyuubi-Chan can I take over now?" asked Naruto</p><P>"<B>I
want do to some thing with your body first before you take over
again"</B> kyuubi said while smiling</p><P>"What
the fuck let me take control!" shouted out Naruto</p><P>Naruto/kyuubi
carried on running and kyuubi told Naruto that they were going to her
home</p><p align="center"><B>----------After 20 minutes----------</B></p><P><B><U>With

<P><p><b>Disclaimer:</b> I don't own Naruto</p><p>"Naruto" normal talk</p><p>"<i>Naruto"</i> thoughts</p><p>"<b>Naruto"</b> demon talking</p><p>"<b><i>Naruto"</i></b> demon thoughts</p><p><b>Chapter 5: </b>Training begins</p><p><u><b>Last time on a twist in a fate</b></u></p><p>"Kyuubi-Chan is that you?"</p><p>"<b>Yeah Naruto-kun"</b></p><p>Naruto jaw dropped as he saw the figure it was kyuubi and when he got a more clearer view of her he could see that she was naked which caused his nose to bleed and as soon as kyuubi smelt the blood she darted towards Naruto and started licking his nose while she was mumbling some words between each lick</p><p>"<b>Naruto-kun (lick) I hope you (lick) don't mind I (lick) haven't tasted blood (lick) for a long time"</b></p><p>Naruto fainted because one a nude kyuubi was on top of him and two she was licking his blood from his nose and some of it from his lips</p><p><u><b>So now on with the story</b></u></p><p>The sun was shining and the birds were chirping as Naruto lazily rolled around in his bed, knowing that he had to get up. He slowly opened his eyes and felt his aching from sleeping on the hard floor all night and slowly got up and started talking to kyuubi.</p><p>"Hey kyuubi-Chan, are you awake"</p><p>"<b>Of course I am demon's never sleep"</b></p><p>"So let's start my training"</p><p>"<b>Before you start your training go and find a rabbit and kill it"</b></p><p>"Why would I do that?"</p><p>"<b>Why else, to eat of course what else are you going to eat in this place now go and find a rabbit?"</b></p><p>"What about that village we could of got some foo…"before Naruto could finish his sentence he got cut of by kyuubi</p><p>"<b>If you go into another village you will get caught since you can't hide your chakra and if Konoha has found out about your fake death they might come looking for you"</b></p><p>Naruto obeyed kyuubi and ran of to find a rabbit and because of his ninja abilities he found one in a couple of minutes and then killed it and asked kyuubi how to skin and cook a rabbit and once that was done he ate and got ready for his training.</p><p>"So kyuubi-Chan can I start my training now"</p><p>"<b>hai, but first I want you to make a clone of me but this time I will be real, ok this is what I want you to do. Much in the same way you create one of your Shadow Clones. As you know I can give you some of my chakra when needed. I will give you a very strong dose of chakra which you will use to create the clone. In the process I will transfer my own mind into the clone and then reshape the chakra energy to take on the form I wish. At this point it will no longer be a clone, but a living breathing being separate from your self." </b></p><p>"Well that doesn't sound too hard."</p><p>"<b>It isn't."</b></p><p>"But how do I know you won't attack me or try to destroy all the villages"</p><p>"<b>Kit you have to trust me and anyway I won't have all my power I'll only be able to use tree tail's"</b></p><p>"Ok then" Naruto said reluctantly</p><p>Naruto performed the hand signs and a clone appeared in front of him and Naruto poured kyuubi chakra into it. The shape of he clone started to transform into a figure, a couple of seconds later he saw kyuubi in front of and she was the same as when he first saw her in the cage(A/N kyuubi isn't naked this time).</p><p>"<b>Finally I'm free!" shouted out kyuubi</b></p><p>"So now can we start the training?"</p><p>"Yes but first I want you to make 100 clones"</p><p>Naruto quickly performed the needed seal's and created 100 clones</p><p>"<b>first I want 20 of your clones to do tree climbing exercises, another 20 to weapon practicing, the rest of them are going to learn techniques in the scroll and before you say anything the clones will learn and when they go back in to your body all the thing's that they learnt will go in to your and your going to do something else"</b></p><p>"What am I going to do?"</p><p>"<b>I'm going to put gravity seals on you"</b></p><p>"what do they do"</p><p>"They weigh you down"</p><p>"Wait, kyuubi-Chan. isn't that the same as using Chakra weights?"</p><p>Kyuubi started laughing at her student's lack of understanding</p><p>"<b>There is a big difference Naruto-kun. When you use chakra weights they don't affect your body equally. If you place weights on your arms and legs, the muscles in those parts of your body will be a lot stronger than the ones in your chest, neck, stomach and the other parts that didn't carry any weights. As you should know the force that gravity exerts on our bodies is balanced. There is not too much of it so it isn't hard to move about and there isn't too less of it so that we float."</b></p><p>Naruto nodded his head absorbing all the information like the proverbial sponge while the nine tailed demon continued</p><p>"<b>The seal I will place on you can only be done by someone who is a master of seals like me. It will tip the balance of the forces so gravity is dominating largely. It will affect every single muscle in your body and you will feel like the ground is pulling you in. There is no respite from this method. Chakra weights only affect you when you move; this will effect you when you attempt to sit down, when you go to sleep. You will always feel the constant effect of being pulled in. Your muscles will never rest whilst you have the seal activated. It takes a great deal of will power to be able to sustain this form of training…but I believe in you to be able to do it."</b></p><p>Naruto knew that this would be the single hardest form of training he would ever experience</p><p>Kyuubi had a smile on her face as he nodded</p><p>"<b>Before I place the seal I'll teach you how to deactivate it since it'll be a lot harder for you to listen when I've put it on."</b></p><p>"Deactivate? I thought I would keep it on continuously."</p><p>Kyuubi looked at his student as if he was stupid</p><p>"<b>Baka!, haven't you been listening? Your muscles will never get the chance to rest whilst the seal is activated. It is important for you to deactivate the seal for a full 24 hours once a week so you can rest up and get used to your body's improvements."</b></p><p>Naruto sheepishly scratched the back of his head</p><p>"Gomen, no need to get worked up"</p><p>"<b>When you have to deactivate the seal channel some chakra into your hand before placing it over where your heart is and say gravity seal release."</b></p><p>Kyuubi told Naruto to take off his jacket and shirt as she gave him his final instruction</p><p>"<b>As soon as I place the seal, be ready to fight with everything you've got. If you're not careful this method could kill you. Be aware at all times."</b></p><p>Naruto got ready placing himself directly in front of kyuubi before a glow began to appear on the demons hand</p><p>"<b>Gravity seal activate</b>!"</p><p>The legendary nine tailed fox drove her hand into the blonde's chest above where his heart was.</p><p>Naruto found himself flying backwards from the force of the technique used on him and landed on his back. He turned onto his hands and knees before remarking</p><p>"That wasn't so b…" He couldn't finish his sentence as there was a small flash on his left pectoral before an intricate set of patterns appeared and he felt himself be pulled in to the ground. He collapsed under the pressure falling face first into the ground with heavy impact.</p><p>"<b>Naruto!"</b> kyuubi cried out in concern.</p><p>Naruto had to use all of his power to get up and finally after waiting for 10 minutes he was finally up</p><p>"<b>Naruto I want you to run around this clearing 30 times so you can get used to the gravity seals"</b></p><p>"What the fuck, this clearing is about is about 20 miles wide"</p><p>"<b>It will help you get stronger"</b></p><p>As soon as Naruto heard that he ran of to begin his long run. Kyuubi was watching him for a moment and then she went of to see how the clones were doing. She went to the first group of clones and saw them doing the tree climbing exercise perfectly so she decide they would do water walking control next.</p><p><u><b>In an unknown place</b></u></p><p>"Is the boy ready yet?"</p><p>"No"</p><p>"He still needs more time"</p><p>"But how do you know we can trust him"</p><p>"Don't worry about that first we have to check if he is good enough to join or we will have to kill him and take his powers away"</p><p><u><b>Out side the borders of the fire country</b></u></p><p>"Kakashi-sensei what exactly are we looking for?" asked sakura</p><p>"Anything the could give us a clue about the killer" replied Kakashi</p><p>Team 7 and Kakashi were running through the forest towards the cloud country to look the person who killed the Anbu guard and Naruto</p><p>"I want you two to and look for people and see if they have seen anything and report back in 2 hours in this spot have you got that" ordered Kakashi</p><p>"Hai" replied sakura</p><p>"Hn" replied Sasuke"</p><p>Sasuke and sakura continued running through the forest when they spotted someone</p><p>"Sakura go and find Kakashi-sensei, I'll handle this"</p><p>Sakura was about to protest but Sasuke was already running of to see who the person was so sakura went to search for Kakashi</p><p>"Hey you, stop"</p><p>"Me"</p><p>"Who do you think your mom, there's no one else in this forest"</p><p>"You little brat, now I remember who you are one of those brats the were with the copy ninja" said the stranger</p><p>"Then y…you must be momoichi z…zabuza momoichi"</p><p>"It looks like you're already scared" said zabuza with a smirk</p><p>"I'm not scared I'm excited I haven't fought a strong ninja for a long time" said Sasuke</p><p>With that Sasuke threw some shurikens at the missing Nin only to see him dodge it</p><p>"Nice tricks brat, but prepare to die!" shouted out zabuza</p><p>Zabuza through two kunai's towards Sasuke only for him to dodge them</p><p>"Now Haku" (A/N Haku is a girl)</p><p>"Demonic ice mirrors"</p><p>Water from the plant's started to come out and slowly ice mirrors were all around Sasuke and then the girl known as Haku step in one of the mirrors and instantly all the mirrors had the girls body in them</p><p>"What is this?" asked Sasuke</p><p>"It's my bloodline and for insulting zabuza I will kill you" replied Haku</p><p>Suddenly senbon needles started coming from all directions and hit Sasuke all over his body</p><p>"Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu (Fire Release: Grand Fireball Technique)"shouted out Sasuke and a huge fireball came out of his mouth and then it hit one of the ice mirrors</p><p>"Now that your ice mirrors are gone I can kill you more easily"</p><p>"Look again"</p><p>"What the fuck there's not even a scratch on it"</p><p>"You can't destroy the mirrors"</p><p>Haku started throwing more needles at Sasuke when she saw his eyes it was red with two commas marks in them</p><p>"Finally I've activated my bloodline now I'll win this fight for sure" said Sasuke arrogantly</p><p>"Sorry but we can't finish this fight of I can hear my master calling me and your friends are coming" said Haku</p><p>With that Haku disappeared</p><p>"Sasuke are you alright"</p><p>"Yeah"</p><p>"Sasuke who were you fighting"</p><p>"I was fighting with someone that was with zabuza"</p><p>"Ok then this mission is over since we haven't found anything let's go home"</p><p><u><b>In an unknown place</b></u></p><p>"What about that girl she fight's well she could have easily defeated that boy"</p><p>"We will have to see"</p><p>"She has one of the demons in her"</p><p>"Which one"</p><p>"The eight tailed ice dragon"</p><p>"But what about her friend"</p><p>"He will protect her"</p><p>"Not if he isn't alive"</p><p>"Who will you assign to do that?"</p><p>"The same two that are going to go after the boy"</p><p><u><b>With Naruto and kyuubi</b></u></p><p>"Kyuubi-Chan I'm finished!" shouted out Naruto</p><p>"<b>Good, now sit down I have to talk to you" </b></p><p>Naruto sat down and listened to what kyuubi is going to say</p><p>"<b>Naruto I will tell you about the blood line you've got from me when I kissed you the first time we saw each other"</b></p><p>Both Naruto and kyuubi started blushing when they remembered it</p><p>"So what is this blood line?"</p><p>"<b>I'll tell you, it has 9 nine stages and you already activated the fist one it gives you unimaginable stamina and a boost of chakra that could rival a Jounins chakra and I'll tell you how to unlock the second stage which stays permanently it will turn you chakra in to demonic chakra so you will be able to use demon taijutsu, genjutsu and ninjutsu but you will have some human chakra"</b></p><p>"How do I unlock it?"</p><p>"<b>It's simple just sign a contract for the fox summoning"</b></p><p>"And how do I do that"</p><p>Kyuubi done some hand seals a scroll appeared in her hand and opened it</p><p>"<b>Now Naruto-kun write your name in blood on this contract"</b></p><p>Naruto bit his thumb but before he could write anything kyuubi was sucking the blood of his thumb</p><p>"How am I suppose to write my name in blood if you keep on sucking the blood of my thumb"</p><p>"<b>Sorry Naruto-kun force of habit"</b></p><p>Naruto bit his thumb again and more blood started coming out and quickly write his name before nine tailed demon could come suck it of again</p><p>"So now how do I summon a fox?"</p><p>"<b>I'll show you, kuchiyose no jutsu" </b></p><p>As soon as she said those words she put her hand on the ground a 2 tailed for appeared</p><p>"Who summoned me?" said the two tailed fox</p><p>"<b>I did"</b></p><p>"Kyuubi-sama I'm so glad to see you but I thought you were sealed inside a human" said the two tailed fox</p><p>"<b>I was but now I'm free"</b></p><p>"So why have you summoned me here"</p><p>"<b>I'm teaching Naruto"</b></p><p>"Who's Naruto?"</p><p>"<b>He was the boy I was sealed in, and it's that boy over there"</b></p><p>"Hey, I'm Kyo" greeted Kyo</p><p>"Hey"</p><p>"<b>Ok then, now Naruto summon a fox"</b></p><p>Naruto done the summoning jutsu and a fox appeared but this one had 4 tails and was nearly as big as Naruto.</p><p>"Who summoned me?" Said the 4 tailed fox</p><p>"I summoned you"</p><p>"Do you really expect me to believe you?" Said the 4 tailed fox</p><p>"<b>He did summon you kyon"</b></p><p>"Kyuubi-sama" Said kyon</p><p>"<b>He is going to be your new master"</b></p><p>"What he's only a kid, and he's a human" said kyon</p><p>"You damn fox I'm your master and I'm not a kid!" shouted out Naruto</p><p>"The only way I'll let you be my master if you can run a full 24 hours without stopping then you then you can be my master"</p><p>"<i>Ha-ha no human can run for 24 hours with out a single breath" thought kyon</i></p><p>"Ok then I'll starts tomorrow in the morning" said Naruto</p><p>"This will be easy since I got my new bloodline"</p><p>"Ok then since I got nothing else to do I'm going home and Kyo are you coming"</p><p>"Yeah" with that both foxes disappeared only leaving a cloud of smoke</p><p>"<b>Go to sleep and let your chakra pathways get used to it being full demon chakra"</b></p><p>"Ok"</p><p><u><b>In an unknown place</b></u></p><p>"He is getting stronger everyday"</p><p>"But how do you know he'll trust us"</p><p>"We will gain his trust but not now"</p><p>"Who will we assign for this mission?"</p><p>"We will assign Itachi and kisame for this mission"</p><p>Author's note: I hoped you like this chapter the next one will be coming very soon and I need some help for making up some more abilities for Naruto bloodline, some demons jutsu's as well in English. The next chapters coming very soon, and remember to R&R.</p>

kyon</I></p><P>"Ok

then since I got nothing else to do I'm going home and Kyo are you

with that both foxes disappeared only leaving a cloud of smoke</p><P>"<B>Go

chakra"</B></p><P>"Ok"</p><P><U><B>In
an unknown place</B></U></p><P>"He
is getting stronger everyday"</p><P>"But
how do you know he'll trust us"</p><P>"We will gain his trust but not now"</p><P><U><B>So
now on with the story</B></U></p><P><U><B>In
the hokage's tower 2 weeks later</B></U></p><P>"Hokage-sama
team 7 have come back along with their sensei" said one of the
Anbu's</p><P>"Ok
bring them in" said the hokage</p><P>After he
gave the order to he Anbu team 7 and Kakashi walked into the hokage's
office</p><P>"So
Kakashi-san how did the mission go" asked the hokage</p><P>"We
couldn't find any clues but we got an encounter with zabuza and his
friend" said Kakashi</p><P>"What!"
shouted the hokage</p><P>"Did any
body get injured?" asked the third</p><P>"No"
replied Kakashi bluntly</p><P>"Good,
and before I forget I've found someone to replace Naruto" said
the third</p><P>"Who is
it?" asked Kakashi</p><P>"I was
just getting there his name is ken, ken you can come in now"</p><P>As soon as
the hokage that those words a boy came through the door he had a
black t-shirt on, black trousers and a pouch on his thigh to store
kunai's in, his hair was black with red streaks in them his eyes
were blue he had a black mask on covering the bottom part of his face
like Kakashi has his mask on and he had a katana on his back.</p><P>"Ken
this is sakura, Sasuke and Kakashi your new team mates and sensei, so
how about you all get to know each other" said the third as he
introduced them</p><P>"Sakura,
Sasuke I want you to take ken to the bridge were we normally meet at"</p><P>"Hai"
said sakura</p><P>Kakashi
disappeared leaving a of cloud of smoke and the new team 7 went to
the bridge and after a couple of minutes they arrived</p><P>"ok then
now that your all here why don't you all introduce your self to ken
and ken you can introduce your self to them about you likes,
dislikes, hobbies and your dream for the future" said Kakashi</p><P>"sensei
why don't you go first" asked sakura"</p><P>"My name
is Hatake Kakashi and I don't want to tell you any of my likes,
dislike, hobbies or my dream for the future" said the copy Nin</p><P>"<I>All
he told us was his name"</I> thought sakura</p><P>"Pinkie
your turn" said the one eyed Sharinghan user</p><P>"Ok, my
name is Haruno sakura and I like…" she was now thinking about at
a raven haired boy</p><P>"And I
hate ino-pig! My hobbies are…" she now looking towards Sasuke</p><P>"Finally
my dream for the future is…" she looked at Sasuke again and was
blushing with some visible drool was coming out of her mouth</p><P>"Sasuke
your turn" asked there sensei</p><P>"My name
is Sasuke I don't like anything neither do I dislike anything. I
have no hobbies and my dream for the future is…no, what I want
isn't a dream it is an ambition to kill a certain man" said
Sasuke</p><P>"Ok, now
ken it's your turn"</p><P>"My name
is ken…and I haven't really thought about anything else" said
ken</p><P>"<I>So I
have a fan girl with no skill at all and an avenger who wants to kill
his brother but the last one is interesting"</I> thought Kakashi</p><P>"Now
that were all done with the introductions let's begin training,
first ken I want to see your skill level so fight with Sasuke but
don't use any jutsu's because your going to need your chakra
later on"</p><P>They both
got in to their fighting stance and the two
fighters quickly narrowed the distance between each other. Sasuke
went in for a straight punch to the gut, but was blocked by ken left
leg as the black haired red streaked ninja jumped up to deliver a
horizontal kick. Sasuke ducked under the kick and rolled away as ken
twisted his body, such that it was in a position parallel to the
ground, and punched downwards. Ken landed in on his arms and legs in
a crouched animalistic position and instantly raised his head to see
what his opponent was doing. Sasuke was running towards him for the
finishing blow but was stopped by Kakashi</p><P>"<I>That
boy could of easily beat Sasuke but he was holding back for some
reason I have to keep an eye on him"</I> thought Kakashi</p><P>"good
fight ken but don't be to disappointed that Sasuke beat you, now
were going to train by climbing up tree's with out your hands and
do any of you know about chakra"</p><P>"I do
sensei" said sakura</p><P>"Ok
sakura you can explain to those two to what it is"</p><P>"Hai,
Chakra can best be described as power or energy a ninja needs in
order to perform techniques. It is probably the most important
element in fighting for ninjas. Chakra consists of two main parts,
the body energy and spiritual energy. Body energy can be tapped into
from the cells in your body. The faster your cells move around in
your body the more energy you have. Body energy provides strength for
a ninja's mind. Spiritual energy is usually acquired from certain
experiences in training or battle. Spiritual energy can be best
described as an adrenaline rush or extra burst of energy. This may
come in handy when a ninja is very tired and worn out."</p><P>"<I>So
it look's like Iruka wasn't that bad of a teacher after all"</I>
thought Kakashi</p><P>"I will
explain what chakra control is, Controlling chakra during battle is
one of the most important aspects in fighting. Another important part
is to being able to build chakra to perform techniques. Building
chakra is essential if you want to perform Genjutsu and Ninjutsu
techniques correctly. Stamina also plays a big part in this. In order
to create chakra you must convert it from stamina. When you perform
techniques you not only release chakra but also stamina. Being unable
to control your chakra can end up being deadly. If you release too
small of an amount, the technique you tried to perform will fail. If
you use too much chakra you may end up severely hurting or killing
yourself. A ninja must have a certain amount of chakra in their body
to live."</p><P>"First
thing you have to do is get chakra to the bottom of your feet and
then try to climb up the tree"</p><P>Kakashi
demonstrated how to climb up the tree and then gave them each a kunai
so they could mark the point were they loose control. All of them
tried it. Sakura and ken got half way up the tree while Sasuke got 10
feet up the tree before loosing control.</p><P><U><B>In
the hokage's tower</B></U></p><P>"Hokage-sama
we have assessed the new ninja and she is currently on Jounin level"</p><P>"Who did
she fight?"</p><P>"Ibiki,
Anko, Kurenai and Gai"</p><P>"How
many of them did she beat?"</p><P>"All of
them…" she couldn't finish her sentence as she was disturbed by
the loud voice of the hokage</p><P>"What!"</p><P>"She
also beat them all at the same time without breaking a sweat"</p><P>"Send
her in I want to talk to her"</p><P>"Hai"</p><P>With that
the Anbu walked out and a tall middle-age woman with long red hair
and red eyes walked in, she was wearing a Jounin vest and trousers.
She wore a white mask covering the bottom of her face. Her tight
Jounin clothes showed of all her curves and her breast could rival
the female of the three sannin walked in to the room.</p><P>"Ayane
I have heard you have been assessed and you're a Jounin level so
you deserve this"</p><P>The
third hokage through a leaf head band to her which she wore on</p><P>"Thank
you hokage-sama"</p><P>"Don't
mention, and there's another reason why I called you here on your
report you handed me it show's you came from the village hidden in
the rain"</p><P>"Hai,
that is right"</p><P>"But
why did you leave"</p><P>"The
people from there hated me and my son ken because of our bloodline
they wanted to kill us"</p><P>"I see
so what is this bloodline of yours"</p><P>"Sorry
hokage-sama but I can't tell you yet"</p><P>"Ok
but I'm sue you have your reasons, you can go now"</p><P>"Thank
you hokage-sama and please don't tell the rain village we are here"</p><P>"Don't
worry I won't and I hope you and your son have a good life here"</p><P>"<I>That
lady is hiding something"</I> thought the third"</p><P><B><U>Konoha
Street's, 1 hour later</U></B></p><P>"Hey
mom, wait up" said ken</p><P>"Hi Ken,
so how was your day" said Ayane</p><P>"It
was…" before he could finish of his sentence he was cut of by the
avenger</p><P>"Ken!"</p><P>"Sasuke
what do you want?" asked Ken</p><P>"I want
to fight you" said Sasuke</p><P>"Ken
let's go home" said Ayane</p><P>"What do
you think your doing you can't turn your head away from an Uchiha"</p><P>"What
makes you think just because you're an Uchiha make you so high"</p><P>Both ken
and Ayane walked away from the Uchiha leaving him angry</p><P>"So are
we going to train?" asked ken</p><P>"Yes"
simply replied his mother ignoring the shout's coming from the
Uchiha saying he wasted to fight</p><P><U><B>With
Kakashi, Asuma, Anko, Kurenai, Ibiki and Gai</B></U></p><P>"Kakashi
have you seen the new ninja" asked Kurenai</p><P>"No"
simply replied Kakashi</p><P>"Must
have been because you were reading your perverted book other wise you
would of known she is currently a Jounin and one of the best ninja's
here probably stronger than you"</p><P>"I find
that hard to believe, a new ninja coming from another village and
she's already a Jounin and one of the strongest ninja's"</p><P>"Ok then
let me ask you a question"</p><P>"What is
it?"</p><P>"Could
you defeat me Ibiki, Anko, and Gai all together at the same time?"</p><P>"What
kind of ques…"before Kakashi finished the sentence he realized
what they were talking about</p><P>"So
she's that strong"</p><P>"I'm
going to have a spar with her. She probably got lucky defeating all
of you"</p><P><U><B>In
an unknown place</B></U></p><P>"So you
want to join us"</p><P>"Hai"</p><P><B>Author's
