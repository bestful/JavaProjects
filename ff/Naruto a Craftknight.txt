Naruto or Summon night swordcraft story 2</p><P>"Arashi are you sure
about this?" Gambunta asked as he carried Arashi closer to the
giant 9 tailed fox which was making its way toward Konoha.</p><P>"I know I'm going
to regret this in the afterlife but I don't want Konoha to be
destroyed by the Kyuubi… I just hope my son doesn't regret me for
this," Arashi said as he looked at the bundle in his arms.</p><P>"All right Arashi
here we go," Gambunta said as he charged at the Kyuubi. Minutes
later after long fighting Arashi was in the process of sealing Kyuubi
in Naruto.</p><P>"<B>What do you wish
to gain from sealing me inside this little mortal? He will be hated
by everyone in his village and they will most likely call him my
incarnation or something like that," Kyuubi said.</B></p><P>"Although I know of
this I can't use any other except for him… I do know that his
life will be a living hell compared to others, but I have to do this
to save the village I love," Arashi said as he continued to pull
out Kyuubi's soul.</p><P>"<B>Such bravery…
very well I shall look over your son and make sure nobody will come
to harm him… once you are done with the sealing I'll use most of
my powers to send him to another world where he shall stay unless he
wants to return… this is my parting gift to you Arashi," Kyuubi
said as her soul was pulled out of her body and into Naruto.</B></p><P>"Arashi you did it,"
Sarutobi said as he caught Arashi from falling.</p><P>"Yes I did… and I
can pass on in peace knowing that my son will not grow being hated,"
Arashi said as his voice became weaker.</p><P>"I will make sure so
too," Sarutobi said as reached for Naruto.</p><P>"Sorry old man… but
Naruto won't be here much longer… Just before kyuubi was sealed
she claimed that she would send little Naruto over here to another
world for his safety… whether or not he wants to return is up to
him. Now good bye old man… oh and you can have my hidden stash of
Icha Icha Paradise under my table in the secrete compartment,"
Arashi said in a dying laughing voice before he died.</p><P>"Damn you Arashi…
leaving me sad but happy is no way to go," Sarutobi thought as he
looked at where Naruto was only to see he was missing also. "Wait…
that means that I have to do more paper work…
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO" Sarutobi shouted outloud which most
ninja thought to be from the death of the fourth Hokage.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Graham what are you
doing here?" Blaire asked as he came up to the blond haired man in
front of the seal of Goura.</p><P>"I just felt the
seals power weaken for a bit just a few seconds ago," Graham said
as he stared at the big crystal like formation in front of him.</p><P>"Really? Looks like
nothing is happening though so we should be ok," Blaire said as he
looked around.</p><P>"Shh… do you here
that?" Graham asked as a crying could be heard in the cavern.</p><P>"Why yes I do… but
isn't that the sound of an infant?" Blaire asked.</p><P>"I think I found the
source," Graham said as he picked up a little blond haired boy with
6 whisker marks.</p><P>"What do you suppose
he's doing here?" Blaire asked as Graham handled the baby with
care.</p><P>"I don't know but
I'll take care of him," Graham said</p><P>"What?!?!? Why would
you want to do that?" Blaire asked.</p><P>"Well Edgar just lost
his mother so I figured he would want to be an older brother to have
some more company," Graham said as he started to pacify the baby.</p><P>"What do you think
his name is?" Blaire asked as the two walked out.</p><P>"…<B>Naruto," a
faint voice said before it disappeared. </B></p><P>"Well I guess his
name is Naruto," Graham said not being freaked out by the voice.</p><P>"We better get him
some clothes or something… he'll freeze to death wearing nothing
like that," Blaire said as he noticed Graham too busy to notice.</p><P>"Edgar will like
this," Graham said as they exited the cave.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>11 years later.</p><P>"Neh Edgar Nii-chan
you sure are strong to beat Goura," Naruto said as he talked to his
older brother who was at the workshop.</p><P>"It wasn't only me
everyone helped out even you Naruto," Edgar said as he turned to
look at his younger adopted brother. "So… are you going to take
up Kyuubi's request and go back to your home world?" Edgar asked
a bit sad.</p><P>"I'm not sure… I
mean I have a great family here with you, master Blaire, Orin
Nii-chan, Tatiana, and everyone else… I am a master Craftknight
because of you and Kyuubi-Chan also," Naruto said receiving a hit
on the head.</p><P>"You insist on
calling me Kyuubi-Chan don't you," a girl with red hair around
Naruto's age said.</p><P>"Well you are my
Guardian beast (1) and we have to get to know each other better, so I
thought that calling you Chan would improve our relationship
Kyuubi-Chan," Naruto said receiving another hit on the head.</p><P>"Gah you never learn
do you?" Kyuubi asked as she was secretly enjoying the attention
she was receiving from Naruto.</p><P>"Man you two have
such a close relationship… kind of puts the bond I have with my
guardian creature to shame," Edgar said as he put his head down in
shame.</p><P>"What are you talking
about we have a perfectly fine bond," a girl with black wings said
as she came into the room.</p><P>"Dinah (2) I know
that but still you gotta admit they have a strong bond both of them,"</p><P>"Well anyway back on
tract what's your decision on leaving for your home world?"
Kyuubi asked.</p><P>"…Give me some more
time to think," Naruto said as he stepped outside of the house.</p><P>"This must be a hard
choice for him," Edgar said as he thought of his adopted little
brother.</p><P>"Yo Edgar what's
wrong with Naruto?" Orin asked as he came inside the room.</p><P>"Yeah Naruto had a
weird look on his face… it was almost as if he was actually
thinking," Tatiana said as she came in after Orin.</p><P>"He was thinking
about if he should go home or not right?" Blaire replied in more of
a statement then a question.</p><P>"Huh what do you mean
by go home?" Orin asked.</p><P>"Yeah isn't his
home here with us?" Tatiana asked clearly confused.</p><P>"Well you see… you
know how Naruto is my adopted little brother right?" Edgar asked
getting a nod from both Orin and Tatiana. "Well this isn't
actually his world just like the summon creatures have their own
world. That's why Kyuubi is giving him the chance of going home and
he's torn because of the decision," Edgar said getting shocked
faces from both of them.</p><P>"It must be tough for
him," Orin said as he thought about it some more.</p><P>"Wow I never knew he
had a story like that," Tatiana said.</p><P>"I'm going to go
look for Naruto," Kyuubi said as she got up and out of the house.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"I know you're here
Naruto," Kyuubi said as she appeared in Goura's sealed cavern.</p><P>"How'd you know?"
Naruto asked as he turned around to see Kyuubi.</p><P>"I was inside of you
for over 8 years before I accepted to be your guardian beast so I
should know where you favorite place to hang out is," Kyuubi said
as she walked up to Naruto.</p><P>"You know me the
best," Naruto said in a weak laugh. "Neh Kyuubi? I can still come
back if I don't like this other world right?" Naruto asked as he
looked up to the ceiling.</p><P>"Of course Naru-Kun…
besides I would never let anyone hurt you as it is my duty to protect
you," Kyuubi said as she hugged Naruto from behind.</p><P>"Thanks Kyuubi,"
Naruto said as he cheered up a bit. "Do you remember how we met?"
Naruto asked Kyuubi as she smilied.</p><P>"Of course… that's
the day I found out that most of the guys in your family were
perverts," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Well… you were
naked and you are more developed then normal people," Naruto said
as he got a minor nose bleed remembering what happened 3 years ago.</p><P><I>Flash back.</I></p><P>"<I>So Naruto who's
this girl you are confident will be your Guardian beast?" Orin
asked the 8 year old Naruto. </I></p><P>"<I>She's a pretty
girl who lives inside of me," Naruto replied.</I></p><P>"<I>Eh… just an
imaginary girlfriend then," Edgar said as if he understood
everything.</I></p><P>"<I>I'm telling you
she's real… and she says she'll be coming out today as long as
I follow her instructions. </I></p><P>"<I>Are you sure you
can trust her?" Blaire all of a sudden asked Naruto.</I></p><P>"<I>EHHH you actually
believe him?" Orin asked in a shocked tone.</I></p><P>"<I>Why should I not
believe him… after all he seems to have the most honesty out of all
of you three," Blaire said getting angry responses from the guys
and Tatiana. "So what does she want you to do?" Blaire asked.</I></p><P>"<I>She wants me to
get one of those summoning runes… like the one you and Orin
Nii-chan have," Naruto said.</I></p><P>"<I>Well I actually
have an extra one on me so here," Blaire said as he handed him the
rune. </I></p><P>"<I>Lets see…
channel my chakra into the rune, now use her chakra then…" Naruto
followed the steps only for a huge explosion to happen. </I></p><P>"<I>Cough Naruto
are you all… Gahh," Blaire said as a huge fountain of blood
started to leek from his nose. </I></p><P>"<I>Whats going
Gahh…" were the responses the three other guys gave as they saw a
naked well developed girl with 9 tails and fox ears. </I></p><P>"<I>Wow… your whole
family are perverts Tatiana," Kyuubi said before Tatiana fainted.
That day the male part of the family almost all died from blood loss.</I></p><P>End Flash back.</p><P>"I can't believe
you were a pervert at such a young age," Kyuubi said giggling.</p><P>"Aw shut up…"
Naruto said as he looked down still blushing. "Well I've decided
to go… and Kyuubi can you make it so that we go right now… I
don't want to say goodbye since it won't really be goodbye,"
Naruto said as Kyuubi understood what he meant.</p><P>"I understand… I'll
open the portal right now… but do you have…" Kyuubi began to
say.</p><P>"Yes I always carry
my equipment around with me so there's no need to worry…"
Naruto said as Kyuubi proceeded to make a portal.</p><P>"Well let's go,"
Naruto said as he was about to step through the portal.</p><P>"STOP!!!!!" Naruto
heard Edgar yell as he ran inside the cavern.</p><P>"Phew we made it,"
Orin said as he entered the cavern followed by everyone else.</p><P>"You thought you
could just go off like that didn't you?" Tatiana asked.</p><P>"Really… Naruto you
should've told us you would be going today so we could set some
kind of grand get away goodbye thing," Blaire said cheerfully.</p><P>"They are right you
know…" Dinah said.</p><P>"I just didn't want
to say goodbye… after all I feel that I'm going to come back
here," Naruto said a tear coming out of his eye.</p><P>"Silly… if you
didn't say goodbye we would've been more worried… besides I
have to give you some of my new cooking," Tatiana said which made
everyone nearby her flinch.</p><P>"Hahaha… I think
I'll be fine without food," Naruto said as he absent mindedly
rubbed his stomach.</p><P>"Naruto be sure to
keep to the morals of a Craftknight," Blaire said in his serious
voice.</p><P>"Yeah… we'll be
waiting for you bro," Edgar said as he looked at Naruto in front of
him.</p><P>"Well… goodbye
everyone," Naruto said as he stepped through the portal with
everyone waving goodbye at him.</p><P>"Things are going to
get lonely here now," Edgar said sadly.</p><P>"That's for sure,"
Dinah said.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>It was another normal
day in Konoha with everyone minding their own business, well normal
if you weren't in Gai's squad. "Gai-Sensei are we done with
training for today," Tenten asked.</p><P>"I guess so… WELL
MY YOUTHFUL STUDENTS WE ARE DISMISSED," Gai said.</p><P>"BUT GAI-SENSEI I
WANT TO TRAIN SOME MORE," Lee said immediately grabbing Gai's
attention.</p><P>"NOW THAT'S THE
TYPE OF ATTITUDE THAT SHOULD BE SHOWN," Gai said.</p><P>"GAI-SENSEI,"</p><P>"LEE,"</p><P>"GAI-SENSEI,"</p><P>"LEE,"</p><P>The two went on as a
sunset appeared behind them.</p><P>"No make it stop,"
Neji said covering his eyes.</p><P>"Take this,"
Tenten," said as she threw some kunai's at the two only for them
to bounce off because of some weird force field.</p><P>"Nothing works… my
eyes are going to become useless," Neji said as some sizzling
noises could be heard from Neji's eyes.</p><P>"Why do we have such
a weird sensei and teammate?" Tenten asked as her eye vision
started to fade. "Please make it stop," Tenten asked. As if
Kami-sama was listening a portal appeared over the duo and out came a
blond boy with a red haired teen.</p><P>"Look out below,"
Naruto said as he landed on Lee while Kyuubi landed on Gai.</p><P>"GAH… GAI-SENSEI…"
Lee said weakly.</p><P>"LEE," Gai said as
he extended his hand out to reach for Lee.</p><P>"Man that sure was a
bumpy ride, right Kyu-chan," Naruto asked Kyuubi who just nodded.</p><P>"My eyes… I'm
saved," Neji said as some steam could be seen trailing out of
Neji's eyes.</p><P>"Seriously… but I
wonder what caused those two to appear here?" Tenten asked as she
saw the blond help the red haired girl up.</p><P>"Ano… is this
Konoha?" Naruto asked the girl as he got off Lee.</p><P>"…Yes it is… and
thank you," Tenten said.</p><P>"Eh? What for?"
Naruto asked as he looked around.</p><P>"You just saved our
sanity for the day," Neji said as his eyes returned to normal.</p><P>"Really now… oh
well now to find the guy called Hokage," Naruto said as he started
to look around.</p><P>"Hmm… if I remember
correctly he was in the largest tower there is in this town,"
Kyuubi said as she walked next to Naruto.</p><P>"Ano… who are you
two?" Tenten asked.</p><P>"Me I'm Naruto a
Master Craftknight and this is my guardian beast Kyu-chan," Naruto
said receiving a hit on the head by Kyuubi.</p><P>"What did I say,"
Kyuubi said in a scary tone.</p><P>"Fine…" Naruto
said in a defeated manner.</p><P>Tenten then broke the
silence by asking, "What's a Craftknight,"</p><P>"A Craftknight is one
who forges weapons and learns how to fight with the ones he makes,"
Naruto said.</p><P>"Really? Then does
that mean you focus your fighting style mainly on weapons also?"
Tenten asked.</p><P>"Yup, of course I
have Kyu-chan here to help me also," Naruto said as he dodged
another punch from Kyuubi.</p><P>"Really then let's
spar," Tenten said with an energetic voice.</p><P>"Sure why not,"
Naruto said as he pulled out a sword. "One of my favorite swords
forged Kyu and my chakra and forged with one of the strongest
materials in our world, we call it Soul Harmony," Naruto said. The
sword itself was a long black sword with red markings on it. It also
seemed to have a line going through the middle of the sword with the
red letters of Kitsune on one side and blue letters of Human on the
other.</p><P>"Naruto don't hurt
her," Kyuubi said from the sidelines.</p><P>"Don't worry
Kyu-chan I won't," Naruto said as he hefted the sword over his
shoulder with ease.</p><P>"That sword must be
light for you to be able to do that," Tenten said as she pulled out
a sword to match Naruto.</p><P>"Here I come,"
Naruto said as he sped forward at a fast speed and slashed downward.</p><P>"Fast," was all
Tenten said before she blocked Naruto's strike only to be pushed
back by the force of it. "He's as strong as Lee also," Tenten
said as she jumped back.</p><P>"Aw come on… I'm
only getting started," Naruto said as he jumped up in the air and
spun around to deliver more of his momentum to strengthen his attack.</p><P>"Crap I can't block
this one," Tenten said as she dodged out of the way to see a huge
crater formed from Naruto's attack.</p><P>"Now that's just
insane… even Lee's strikes can't do that," (Remember this is
still 1 year before this team took the chunnin exam and Lee is super
powerful then)</p><P>"LEE LOOK AT THAT
KID'S ATTACK IT'S SO FULL OF YOUTH," Gai said as he suddenly
was on his feet.</p><P>"GAI-SENSEI CAN I
MATCH UP TO HIM?" Lee asked.</p><P>"YOU CAN WITH MORE
HARD WORK AND TRAINING!!!!" Gai shouted.</p><P>"ALL RIGHT I SHALL
ADD MORE SETS TO MY EXERCISES TO IMPROVE MYSELF," Lee said.</p><P>"I AM SO PROUD OF YOU
MY STUDENT," Gai said as he hugged Lee.</p><P>"GAI-SENSEI," Lee
began.</p><P>"LEE…" Gai began
but couldn't as the battle began to come their way.</p><P>"Gah this seems to be
more dangerous then the Dynamic Duo's show," Neji said as he
jumped away.</p><P>"Oi Naruto… stop
showing off," Kyuubi shouted to Naruto.</p><P>"Why… you know you
feel prideful too when you see me use this sword," Naruto said as
he created another crater from a failed attack.</p><P>"Then use it
properly," Kyuubi shouted.</p><P>"Fine then…
activate <U>Kitsune soul</U>," Naruto shouted making the red
writings on the sword overlap the blue ones and cover the whole
sword. The sword soon started to glow a dark red color which soon
enveloped Naruto.</p><P>'This chakra… I
remember feeling it 11 years ago… it's impossible,' Gai thought
as he saw Naruto charge up.</p><P>"Time for some real
skills," Naruto said as he started to circle around Tenten creating
multiple afterimages. "<U>First Level Kitsune Fire,"</U> Naruto
shouted as his afterimages started to blaze up before they turned
into blue fire spites and charged at Tenten.</p><P>"Geeze I better take
this out," Tenten said as she unrolled a scroll and started to
unseal weapons and toss them at a fast rate.</p><P>"Oh sealed weapons…
now that's convenient," Naruto said as he watched most of the
weapons destroy the fire spites while the remaining weapons melted on
touch.</p><P>"How am I going to
defeat this guy?" Tenten asked as she unsealed more weapons to
launch at Naruto.</p><P>"Sorry but I'm
ending this now," Naruto said as he disappeared from sight. "<U>Level
one Soul Slash,</U>" Naruto said as he made quick rapid slashes
going through Tenten.</p><P>"Huh what… Gah,"
Tenten yelped as she felt something break within her before she
collapsed. Neji who was watching the whole thing was shocked.</p><P>"You just hit her
chakra system… similar to the Hyuuga's(spelling) fighting style
but it just hit her chakra system affecting her body as well," Neji
said as he went over to Tenten.</p><P>"Ahh don't worry
she'll be ok I used a level one technique so it should only affect
her for an hour… although Edgar nii-san didn't get better for at
least 1 day when I used it on him," Naruto said the last part
silently.</p><P>"Oh well looks like
we don't need to go look for the hokage," Kyuubi said as she
stood up.</p><P>"Hmm… the Hokage is
that old man?" Naruto asked as an old man came into the clearing
with some people in masks.</p><P>"Who are you?"
Sarutobi asked as he looked at the blond trying to remember
something.</p><P>"The name's Naruto…
if I'm right my dad used to live here so I thought I would visit
this world once and decide if I should really live in it," Naruto
said as he looked at shocked face of the Hokage.</p><P>"Are you really
Naruto?" Sarutobi asked with a shaky voice.</p><P>"The one and only
here in the flesh," Naruto said as he stretched around.</p><P>"11 years… that's
how long it's been," Sarutobi said before tears of happiness came
down from his eyes.</p><P>"Hokage-sama who is
this little kid," one of the ANBU members asked clearly confused at
what was going on.</p><P>"Nothing you need to
worry about now… I want you to transport Naruto here and his
companion to my office now," Sarutobi said getting a Hai out of
them.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So boy where and
what have you been doing all these years?" Sarutobi asked.</p><P>"I've been in
another world living happily there with my family. As for what I was
doing I became a craftknight just like my father and brother,"
Naruto said.</p><P>"I see…" Sarutobi
said with a bit of guilt in his voice.</p><P>"So do the people
know about her?" Naruto asked as he pointed to Kyuubi.</p><P>"Her? Even I don't
know who she is," Sarutobi said.</p><P>"Are you sure about
that," Naruto said as Kyuubi all of a sudden had 9 tails and fox
ears.</p><P>"KYUUBI!!!"
Sarutobi shouted before he regained control of himself. "You
unsealed that monster?" Sarutobi asked.</p><P>"Hey I'm not a
monster!" Kyuubi said trying to defend herself.</p><P>"Yeah she's my
guardian beast and nobody calls my partner a monster," Naruto said
going on the defensive.</p><P>"I'm sorry it's
just that she attacked our village 11 years ago if she told you,"
Sarutobi said trying to make up for what he said.</p><P>"Yeah that's true
if you guys hadn't disturbed my beauty sleep," Kyuubi said
getting cranky from remembering what happened in the past. "But
what's in the past is in the past,"</p><P>"I thank you for
that," Sarutobi said. "As for Naruto here… I think you should
attend the academy to at least get to know the students at your age,"
Sarutobi said.</p><P>"Fine… as long as I
get a home with a forge then I'm happy," Naruto said.</p><P>"Geeze… Blaire has
pounded Craftknight morals too much into that thick head of yours,"
Kyuubi said getting Naruto just to stare at her.</p><P>"What won't you
feel better if we can continue on making weapons and maybe make a
better weapon then Soul Harmony?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"True… all right
it's decided Old man get us a house with a forge.</p><P>"… How did it turn
out like this?" Sarutobi asked, "All right I'll get you a house
with a forge in it… although it might take some time," Sarutobi
said as he looked though some documents.</p><P>"Don't worry me and
Kyu-chan will explore town until you find us a home," Naruto said
as he dodged another fist from Kyuubi. "My Kyu-chan you're
becoming really obvious now with your attacks," Naruto said as he
dodged another fist from Kyuubi.</p><P>"Damn you take this
then," Kyuubi said as her red chakra surrounded her arm extending
her range.</p><P>"Hey no fair,"
Naruto said as he had trouble dodging most of the hits sent by
Kyuubi.</p><P>"This town is going
to be loud the next few days now isn't Arashi," Sarutobi said as
he looked up towards Arashi's picture.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Time to eat,"
Naruto said started to look at the food vendors around Konoha.</p><P>"Please don't let
there be a stand of it," Kyuubi said under her breath.</p><P>"RAMEN!!!!" Naruto
shouted as he smelled some and rushed off to it.</p><P>"I should've prayed
harder," Kyuubi said as she followed after Naruto.</p><P>"Oi Naruto remember
we don't have any…" Kyuubi began to say only to stop when she
saw 3 empty bowls by Naruto.</p><P>"Hey Kyu-chan,"
Naruto said in a mouth full of noodles.</p><P>"Oh well I guess this
was inevitable," Kyuubi said as she sat down also. A few minutes
later a familiar girl walked in with two hair buns.</p><P>"Hello sword girl,"
Naruto said as the girl walked in.</p><P>"Oh hello Naruto,"
Tenten said.</p><P>"Hello miss…"</p><P>"Tenten I guess I
forgot to introduce myself when we last met," Tenten said as she
sat next to the two.</p><P>"That was really
impressive back there," Tenten said trying to start a conversation.</p><P>"Yeah thanks… its
all thanks to the training I've been receiving, also I understand
everything about my weapons because me and Kyu-chan personally make
them," Naruto said as he brought out a shield from somewhere to
block Kyuubi's attack.</p><P>"We also put our
everything into making the weapons so they are the best of quality,"
Naruto said as he put the shield away.</p><P>"I see… then can
you make me a weapon like that sword you had?" Tenten asked.</p><P>"I'm not sure
really… because the weapons me and Kyu-chan make are for my use
mainly so I don't know how to make another weapon for someone
else," Naruto said as he ducked to dodge a hit from Kyuubi.</p><P>"Gah… have I really
dulled in skill that much?" Kyuubi asked as she sent out a flurry
of punches only for Naruto to dodge them while eating the ramen he
had.</p><P>"Naruto-san the
Hokage requests your presence at this location," an ANBU member
said as he handed Naruto a slip of paper.</p><P>"I see thank you…
Hey old man charge all this on the old man Hokage all right?"
Naruto said as he left the stand with Kyuubi.</p><P>"I'll be making a
profit tonight the ramen vender said as he started to total the
amount eaten.</p><P>"I hope he can make
me a weapon," Tenten said before leaving the stand.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Here you go Naruto
this is your new home," Sarutobi said as he showed Naruto the huge
mansion like house in front of him. "It used to belong to Arashi
your father so you should receive this," Sarutobi said as he let
Naruto through.</p><P>"Thanks old man we
appreciate it," Naruto said as he and Kyuubi went inside.</p><P>"Oh Naruto go to the
academy at 7:00 AM tomorrow for classes alright?" Sarutobi asked
only receiving a grunt for an answer.</p><P>"This house is great
I mean it is big and has almost everything we could possibly want,"
Naruto said as he explored the house some more.</p><P>"It has a nice
backyard for me to relax in," Kyuubi said as she turned into a fox.</p><P>"Have fun," Naruto
said as he went upstairs found a room and went to sleep.</p><P>1 hour later.</p><P>"Good night
Naruto-kun," Kyuubi said as she went up to Naruto gave him a soft
kiss on the lips. "Hehheh too bad he doesn't realize I've been
doing this for a while… oh well he does have the right stuff to be
a great mate," Kyuubi said before she climbed into the bed to sleep
with Naruto.</p><P>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Next day.</p><P>"Ok class we have a
newcomer and he's supposed to come today…. Let's see his name
is Uzumaki Naruto age 11… that's all that I have for you guys,"
Iruka said to the class.</p><P>"So Iruka sensei
where is he?" one student asked.</p><P>"I don't know about
that," Iruka answered only to here stamping of feet.</p><P>"Sorry I'm late,"
Naruto said as he entered the room. "My name is Naruto pleased to
meet ya," Naruto said.</p><P>Omake</p><P>"Naruto you're hurt
do you need me to heal you?" Kyuubi asked as she walked up to
Naruto.</p><P>"Nah… I just got
this from training with Edgar… he just accidentally stabbed me with
his spear in the chest," Naruto said showing the wound in his
chest.</p><P>"Gah… let me heal

talk/thoughts'</p><P>"<I>Flash
backs,"</I></p><P>"Normal,"</p><P>"<B>Kyuubi
huge form."<BR></B><p></p><P>"<U>Techniques"</U></p><P>Some A/N before
more A/N: I forgot to tell you guys why I put the numbers on the last
chapter so I will now… I was too tired to remember last time I
wrote it.</p><P>Those who play
the game know what a guardian beast is… I just decided that Kyuubi
should be one…</p><P>I
played the game through as Edgar the first time I played it and had
his guardian beast be Dinah which I like.</p><P>Disclaimer: Me no own
Naruto or Summon night swordcraft story 2 or the moves from Final
fantasy 3(from jap) but I do own the moves that I make up.</p><P>What everybody saw was
a 11 year old boy with a white shirt on with an orange scarf that
trailed from his neck. Around his neck was also a small red fox which
seemed to be sleeping. On his back was his sword Soul Harmony and on
his side was his hammer which he always carried with him.</p><P>"Let's see… so
you're Uzumaki Naruto…" Iruka began to say.</p><P>"I prefer to be
called Fencer(1 won't forget this time) Naruto," Naruto said as
he corrected Iruka.</p><P>"All right then…
Fencer Uzumaki Naruto just choose a seat and we'll get started with
class," Iruka said as he turned around and started to write
something on the board.</p><P>"Ok," Naruto said
as he looked around and saw an empty seat in the back of the room by
a boy who had sunglasses. 'I guess I'll sit next to that guy,'
Naruto thought as he moved his way up and sat next to the sun glass
guy. "Hello you already know my name so what's yours?" Naruto
asked as class began.</p><P>"Shino…" Shino
said before doing what he always did… nothing.</p><P>"I see," Naruto
said as he looked around noticing the other classmates. Out of the
20 students he only noticed 8 strong ones as Kyuubi told him also.</p><P>'Man did Konoha lose
it's prestige or what… only 8 nin's here… well 9 now
including you are only capable of becoming nin,' Kyuubi thought as
she moved her small fox head around.</p><P>'Most of these guys
wouldn't even stand a chance against the weak stray summons from
our world,' Naruto thought as he looked at the other 8 nins.</p><P>'Hmm… last time I
was here I saw at least 7 good clans in this village when they went
up against me… looks like those 7 out of 8 are part of those clans
except the girl with pink hair… although she's weak she's
stronger then most other girls,' Kyuubi thought to Naruto as she
started to comment on the nins.</p><P>'I see… hmm the
lesson plan… history on Konoha? Why would ninjas need to know
history?' Naruto thought.</p><P>'Don't know and
don't care… how about we start training in your mindscape. I'll
meet you inside,' Kyuubi thought as the fox around Naruto
disappeared only noticed by Shino who then saw Naruto fall asleep.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Man this is so much
better," Naruto said as he entered his mind.</p><P>"Obviously," Kyuubi
said as she changed into her human form to meet Naruto. "Well since
we're here I'll be teaching you more on Chakra control," Kyuubi
said.</p><P>"You mean there is
more then just enhancing body strength and stuff?" Naruto asked
Kyuubi.</p><P>"Well sort of… you
don't know of elemental manipulation that well yet do you?"
Kyuubi asked as Naruto cocked his head to the right.</p><P>"Eh? Is it like the
attacks you use from different elements?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"Well sort of…
we're just going to do an exercise that allows you to manipulate
what affinity you are," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"So what affinity am
I then?" Naruto asked getting the idea a bit more.</p><P>"Well your main
affinity is wind… but since you've been using my chakra with the
weapons we make a lot you seemed to have gotten a affinity for all
the elements that I have… which are most of them," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"COOOL," Naruto
shouted as he started thinking of what he could do.</p><P>"That means that
you'll have to train yourself in all the elements that I did until
you master them so you can control them like I can," Kyuubi said as
she put her hand out in front of her. "Take wind for an example, it
is very sharp and there's plenty of it around us," Kyuubi said as
small blades of winds could be seen forming in kyuubi's hand.</p><P>"Amazing… and
you're not using mana for this," Naruto said as he studied her
hand.</p><P>"Of course… well
get started by focusing your chakra to your hand and form some wind
blades," Kyuubi said as she sat down on a sofa that appeared out of
nowhere. 'Time to enjoy the show,' Kyuubi thought as she saw
Naruto struggle with the exercise.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Outside Shino looked in
amusement as Naruto started to twitch his fingers and eyes as he
slept. Not that he minded since as long as nobody bothered him he
wouldn't bother them.</p><P>"OK so anybody know
the answer to this question?" Iruka asked as he turned around to
the class to ask a student. "Hmm… Naruto please answer this
question," Iruka said waiting for an answer only to see him
sleeping.</p><P>"Naruto WAKE UP!!!"
Iruka yelled as he threw a piece of chalk at Naruto. When the chalk
piece hit Naruto though a gust of wind went through the classroom
although only Shino noticed.</p><P>"Huh?" Naruto said
as he woke up and Kyuubi appeared right next to him unnoticed by
most.</p><P>"Can you answer who
defeated the Kyuubi?" Iruka asked getting a growl out of Kyuubi.</p><P>"Heh… fourth hokage
Yondaime?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"That's right the
fourth hokage…." Iruka began again with his lecture.</p><P>'You know I would've
won if he didn't catch me off guard,' Kyuubi thought mentally to
Naruto who just grinned.</p><P>'But if that never
had happened we would have never met,' Naruto thought back getting
an affectionate bite from Kyuubi.</p><P>'Heh don't be so
proud Naruto… well let's return to training,' Kyuubi thought as
the two stayed in Naruto's mindscape for the rest of class.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Finally school's
over," Naruto shouted as he ran out with Kyuubi trailing behind
him.</p><P>'Geeze it wasn't
that bad,' Kyuubi said as she jumped onto Naruto's shoulder.</p><P>"Well the faster we
get home to more time I can work on creating a new weapon," Naruto
said as he walked faster.</p><P>'Gah… geeze you're
as bad Edgar when it comes to Craftknight ideals,' Kyuubi said as
they arrived at their house.</p><P>"So what… we did
grow up with Master Blaire who practically drilled what we had to do
to become a craftknight everyday," Naruto said as he felt Kyuubi
jump off his shoulder and transform to her human self.</p><P>"Fine we'll work on
making one weapon today… but after that we're training and
exploring a bit," Kyuubi said as she went down to the forge.</p><P>"It seems like you're
more eager to make a weapon then me," Naruto said as he followed
her downstairs.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>2 hours later</p><P>"So what kind of
weapon is this?" Kyuubi asked as Naruto picked up the creation.</p><P>"I thought of what
you said of element manipulation today so I made a staff that could
help me channel elemental chakra," Naruto said as he picked up the
staff and started to push chakra into the staff. The staff soon
glowed a greenish color with a few gusts of wind flying around his
body before they died down.</p><P>"I see you need to
train some more," Kyuubi said as Naruto lay down on the ground
exhausted.</p><P>"Heh… even if I do
make good weapons I guess it's useless if I can't even use them
to their maximum potential," Naruto said as he put the staff on his
back crossing over his sword.</p><P>"You got that right…
so let's go training," Kyuubi said as she pulled Naruto outside.</p><P>Outside.</p><P>"So we have 1 year
until you become genin so we should train some more… maybe we could
even visit your foster family," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Real family… after
all you remember what happened when otou-san saved both me and Edgar…
he used his power to save both me and Edgar from that stupid
summoner," Naruto said the last part in disgust.</p><P>"Something strange
was coming so I had to make your body adapt to the foreign substance…
causing you to literally become related to Edgar," Kyuubi said
while sticking out her tongue with her one hand behind her head.</p><P>"Oh well it actually
was a change for the betting in my opinion," Naruto said as they
walked around. "So where can we go train?" Naruto asked as he
looked around.</p><P>"I smell some open
area over there," Kyuubi said as she pulled Naruto along with her
and soon they reached an open area with no one in it thankfully. "Ok
start with your warm-up and then we'll have mass sparring with your
shadow clones," Kyuubi said only to see Naruto already halfway done
with his warm-up.</p><P>"I see…" Kyuubi
said as she went on practicing herself, even if you are all powerful
you need to keep on practicing and training to be the top of the top.</p><P>"Kyuubi I'm done,"
Naruto said as he stood up some sweat dropping from his head.</p><P>"Ok now make at least
300 clones and have an all out battle with me as your support,"
Kyuubi said.</p><P>"All right," Naruto
said as he formed a cross seal, "<U>Kage Bunshin no Jutsu</U>,"
Naruto said as 300 Naruto's came into existence each one with
weapon in his hand.</p><P>"All right you guys
know the drill," Naruto shouted.</p><P>"Yosh!!!" the
clones shouted as they all charged into Naruto.</p><P>"Ack not so fast,"
Naruto said as he jumped up into the air. "Fine have it your way
then," Naruto shouted as he pulled out a scroll and put his blood
on it. As soon as he put his blood on the scroll a giant axe came out
from the scroll. It was a dark green color and the handle was as tall
as him. The Axe was a double bladed one and was about 1 meter wide.</p><P>"Kyuubi Earth enchant
now," Naruto shouted.</p><P>"Fine," Kyuubi
shouted as she jumped up and appeared over Naruto before pushing mana
into the weapon Naruto had.</p><P>"Good," Naruto said
as he started to spin with the axe in mid air. "<U>Giant Impact</U>,"
Naruto shouted as he slammed his axe with all his momentum into the
ground. The effect was instantaneous as the earth top layer exploded
in a blast of rocks destroying at least a fourth of the clones.</p><P>"Get him right now.
His axe speed should be slower then one with a sword," said a clone
as he charged in with his sword.</p><P>"That should be true
if I didn't have Kyuubi," Naruto said as he jumped up into the
air again to flip backwards and sweep the area below him. "Kyuubi
<U>Quickening,"</U> Naruto shouted which Kyuubi responded to making
Naruto's whole body glow a pale white color mostly concentrated on
his legs.</p><P>"Kuso," one of the
clones said as he saw the spell take place.</p><P>"Get him now," said
another as he too had an axe and jumped up in the air to spin just
like the real Naruto had done. "<U>Giant Impact,"</U> the clone
imitated the attack only to poof out of existence when Naruto swung
his arm.</p><P>"I'm at least 5
times faster with the level of spell Kyuubi hit me with… you guys
don't stand a chance now," Naruto said as he threw the axe up
into the air and took out another scroll. "Let's go," Naruto
said as he unsealed the weapon which was a pair of fist gauntlets
that had each finger slightly extended like claws.</p><P>"Hmm you chose the
weapon I like I see," Kyuubi said as she acknowledged Naruto's
weapons.</p><P>"I think you just
like them because they were named by you… Kitsune Claws," Naruto
said as he formed a fist with his hands. "<U>Blitz: Pummel</U>,"
Naruto shouted as he rushed forward throwing lightning fast punches
with his enhanced speed.</p><P>"Aw this is unfair
with you using Kyu-chan as a support while we only have an army of
300," (No I did not see the movie 300… quite funny now since I
write the number now I just realized that there was a movie called
300). One of the clones complained as Naruto moved in on him.</p><P>"Well you guys know
what I know so it shouldn't be that outmatched," Naruto said a he
started to spin around "<U>Blitz: Air Blade,</U>" Naruto shouted
as he shot out blades of wind which split the clones in half before
they were dispelled.</p><P>"Take this then," 5
clones with spears said as they closed in on Naruto. "<U>Pentagon
Strike Combo</U>," all 5 said at once as they all attacked Naruto
from 5 points.</p><P>"I wonder why I even
made up that combo," Naruto said as he frantically looked for a way
to escape. Naruto looked up and jumped only to receive a hit in the
face from one of the 5 clones as they used the long reach of the
spear to knock Naruto out of the air.</p><P>"Yatta we finally got
him," one of the clones said as they continued with the combo
hitting Naruto into the air.</p><P>"Kind of sad how we
are beating him up with his own move," another clone said as he
used the back end of the spear to hit Naruto square in the stomach
and knock out the air in his lungs.</p><P>"Not done yet," the
real Naruto said as he gathered chakra into his fist. "<U>Blitz:
Aura bolt</U>," Naruto said as he shot out 5 bolts of energy
dispelling the clones. "Now I'm mad," Naruto said as he put his
arms to his legs. "The weights," Naruto began.</p><P>"Are not coming off,"
Kyuubi said as she hit Naruto on the head.</p><P>"But why?" Naruto
asked as the other clones looked on with amusement.</p><P>"Because if you take
them off then this won't be training," Kyuubi said as she stood
next to Naruto.</p><P>"Fine…" Naruto
said as he took off the sword on his back. "I always wanted to see
what it would be like to combine two weapon effects," Naruto said
as the glove gave off an red glow while the sword gave off a red
glow. "Soul Harmony combine effects with Kitsune claws," Naruto
shouted as the two colors mixed giving off a strong aura. "Too much
power," Naruto said as he felt intense pressure in holding the
weapons. "I have to get rid of the power quickly if I'm going to
survive," Naruto said as he threw Soul Harmony in front of him
destroying a clone.</p><P>Naruto then rushed
forward in a fluid motion destroying any clone in his way before he
caught his falling sword. "It's over," Naruto said as he
released most of the energy formed from the two weapons. "Finally,"
Naruto said.</p><P>"You Baka," Kyuubi
shouted as she successfully hit Naruto on the head. "You're not
experienced to handle such pressure… a moment longer and your body
would've destroyed itself from the inside out because of all the
chaos that was ensuing from the power. (2)</p><P>"But… I was able to
control it for a bit and not go unconscious," Naruto said as he
weakly stood up. "I'm just surprised barely anybody showed up
because of all the commotion I was making," Naruto said.</p><P>"Don't be too sure
of that," Kyuubi said as she pointed to a tree to show Shino
sitting there calmly.</p><P>"Were you watching
the whole thing?" Naruto asked as he walked to Shino.</p><P>"Yes… I knew you
weren't normal when I first saw you," Shino said in a quiet
manner.</p><P>"Really… most of
the others seemed to think of me as a dope… especially that Sasuke
guy," Naruto said as he started to feel better a bit.</p><P>"So do you train like
this everyday…?" Shino asked in his quiet manner.</p><P>"Sort of… well I
usually train with my older brother who is stronger then me although
he does have his weak points," Naruto said.</p><P>"Hmm…" was
Shino's response.</p><P>"Hey Shino do you
want to train with me? It will most likely improve your weapons
skills… and I might be able to make you a weapon with your help,"
Naruto asked.</p><P>"…" Shino
remained quiet.</p><P>"If you don't want
to then it's all right," Naruto said turning around.</p><P>"I'll accept,"
Shino said quietly only loud enough for Naruto to hear.</p><P>"That's good!!"
Naruto shouted. "Do you know chakra control?" Naruto asked
quickly.</p><P>"Chakra control?"
Shino asked.</p><P>"Like this," Naruto
said as he walked up a nearby tree. Naruto could swear he saw Shino's
eyes expand a bit when he saw Naruto use his chakra.</p><P>"So that's chakra
control," Shino said amazed.</p><P>"You should work on
that for now… I can't help you that much since I have to work on
elemental manipulation," Naruto said as he summoned more shadow
clones.</p><P>"Who's she?"
Shino asked as he pointed to Kyuubi.</p><P>"You already know
her… well not her name. She's the fox from earlier Kyu-chan,"
Naruto said getting a shocked expression from Shino which even made
his glasses fall. "I'll explain more as we train more," Naruto
said as he went to his task.</p><P>"I think we have
another visitor also," Shino said as a bug went up his arm.</p><P>"Cool bugs!!"
Naruto shouted.</p><P>"You're not afraid
of them?" Shino asked as he extended his arm for Naruto to see.</p><P>"Nope not at all…
after all I had to fight some bigger bugs then those from where I
lived… although if I didn't bother them they wouldn't bother me
so yeah…" Naruto said getting Shino to raise his eyebrow. "So
who's the other?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"Ahh… my bugs tell
me it's some girl that has been here since the beginning of the
conversation," As Shino said that Tenten came out from the trees
showing herself.</p><P>"That's unfair…
you promise him to make a weapon and not me," Tenten said in a
whiny voice.</p><P>"Well he's my
classmate and I guess a friend of mine in Konoha now," Naruto said
rubbing the back of his head.</p><P>"Oh well so if I
train with you can you make me a weapon also?" Tenten asked.</p><P>"I guess… but you
guys would need to come to my house one day and help me make the
weapon yourselves," Naruto said.</p><P>"Sure anytime!"
Tenten said enthusiastically.</p><P>"…Ok" Shino
responded.</p><P>"Let's start
training," Naruto shouted.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Well today was
interesting," Naruto said as he climbed into his bed.</p><P>"I'll say… we
actually made some friends in this village… even though most of the
people in the village don't even know of the secrete yet," Kyuubi
said as she stood by the door.</p><P>"Oh well I'm going
to sleep g'night Kyu-chan," Naruto said as he brought out a
shield from under the bed to block Kyuubi's attack.</p><P>"Gah… you keep all
your weapons in arm's reach don't you?" Kyuubi asked as Naruto
put away the shield.</p><P>"A craftknight must
always be prepared," Naruto said as he fell asleep.</p><P>"Good night to you
Naruto," Kyuubi said as she kissed Naruto softly before climbing
into his bed.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>1 year later.</p><P>"So Naruto… do you
think you'll pass the test?" Shino asked Naruto as they waited.
Over the year Naruto had gotten Shino to open up more although it was
only for him. Shino now talked normally to Naruto but still in his
discreet manner with the other students.</p><P>"Most likely I will…
after what I have seen from the course material it won't even be a
challenge," Naruto said as he heard his name called, "See you
later Shino," Naruto said as he left the room to get tested.</p><P>"Naruto for this test
you'll create a bunshin, 3 of them and you'll pass," Iruka
said.</p><P>"Sure," Naruto said
as three bunshin's appeared next to him without him moving.</p><P>"H-How did you do
that?" Iruka asked.</p><P>"I know a more
advanced technique then this… it is similar but different. Since I
use that technique often I guess my body learned how to do bunshin
without seals," Naruto said as he picked up a headband. "See ya
sensei's Naruto said as he left the room.</p><P>'Kuso now I'll have
to steal the scroll,' Mizuki thought as he saw Naruto exit.</p><P>Later.</p><P>"Congrats on passing
Naruto," Shino said as they were eating in a ramen stand.</p><P>"I said it would be
easy and it was," Naruto said as he finished another bowl.</p><P>"Man has Konoha's
standards gone down or what," Kyuubi said. "Most of these Genin's
will get killed with only academy knowledge in them…" Kyuubi
added.</p><P>"True… that's why
we have Jounin Sensei's to train us," Naruto said as he started
on his 4th bowl.</p><P>"I wonder if we'll
be on the same team," Shino thought.</p><P>"Well I hope so,"
Naruto said.</p><P>"I see you two
passed," Tenten said as she walked into the stand.</p><P>"Oh hey Tenten,"
Naruto said which Shino emulated.</p><P>"So what are you two
going to do after you finish eating?" Tenten asked.</p><P>"I'm going to go
back to my family compound… they seem to have something for me
there," Shino said as he relaxed in his seat.</p><P>"Me I'm going to
the forest to relax a bit tonight… I think it's going to be a
full moon so it should be beautiful," Naruto said calmly.</p><P>"Yea lots of mana
will probably shine down," Kyuubi added from next to Naruto.</p><P>"Ahh really… well I
have to go meet with my team for a mission… we won't be in town
for a month so don't look for me ok?" Tenten asked.</p><P>"Sure just use that
weapon we made… It's quite amazing if I say so myself,"(3)
Naruto said.</p><P>"I know… and I
haven't even found out all the abilities yet," Tenten said as she
eagerly jumped up and down. "Oh I can't wait to find out more,"
Tenten said.</p><P>"Oh well I guess I'll
go now… let's go Kyu-chan," Naruto said.</p><P>"Alright let's,"
Kyuubi said as she walked next to Naruto and then tried to elbow him
only to have a wind like barrier repel her attack.</p><P>"Your attacks are too
obvious Kyu-chan you'll never beat me like that," Naruto said in
a taunting manner.</p><P>"Gah… I should've
never taught you elemental manipulation… I swear your wind
manipulation is better then mine," Kyuubi said in a pouting manner.</p><P>"See ya later
Naruto-kun," Tenten said as she also left.</p><P>"Bye, and thanks for
the weapon"(4) Shino said as he also left.</p><P>"…they didn't pay
again," the ramen store vender said as he wrote something in a
notebook. The cover read 'What Hokage Owes Me,'</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"A beautiful night
just like I said," Naruto said as he lied down on the grass looking
up at the moon.</p><P>"This place is so
full of mana tonight," Kyuubi said as she too lied down on the
grass close to Naruto.</p><P>"Just like home…"
Naruto said with a bit of sadness in his voice.</p><P>"You know we can go
back any time," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"I do know that…
but I think this world should have a fair share of me before I go
back home," Naruto said as he started to think of his family.</p><P>"Someone's coming,"
Kyuubi said suddenly as both became alert.</p><P>"Is that Mizuki?"
Naruto asked as he saw a ninja jump over them. "It is!! Hi
Mizuki-sensei," Naruto shouted making the nin stop dead still.</p><P>"Crap I've been
caught," Mizuki said as he started thinking of what to do.</p><P>"Caught? Did you do
something bad Sensei?" Naruto asked as he went closer to Mizuki.</p><P>"I have no choice but
to kill you now," Mizuki said suddenly as he turned around and
threw a fuma shuriken at Naruto.</p><P>"Huh what the?"
Naruto said as he dodged the Fuma shuriken only to meet a fire blast
from Mizuki.</p><P>"I'm going to make
sure that your body isn't even recognizable," Mizuki said as he
prepared another jutsu.</p><P>"Don't be too sure
of that," Naruto said as he stood up, glowing a bright blue color
before his wounds disappeared. "Thank's Kyu," Naruto said
before he rushed forward and kneed Mizuki in the face.</p><P>"Damn you brat I'll
show you," Mizuki said as he opened the scroll and started to read
through it.</p><P>"Oh sure now I'm
really scared," Naruto said as Mizuki started to read faster.</p><P>"Take this brat. I
summon you here now answer my call come forth Summon Creature,"
Mizuki said as he read directly off of what the scroll said while he
held a weird blue crystal(5).</p><P>"Nani?!?! Summon
creature here!" Naruto exclaimed surprised as the scroll started to
glow before a portal opened up and out came a robotic creature.</p><P>"That shouldn't be
here," Kyuubi said as she prepared to go on the offensive.</p><P>"I don't know what
this is but kill them," Mizuki ordered which the robot complied to.</p><P>"Kyu-chan I'll take
this on my own you stop Mizuki," Naruto said as he pulled out his
staff.</p><P>"Right," Kyuubi
said as she jumped after Mizuki.</p><P>"I'll take you on,"
Naruto said as the staff started to green before gusts of wind formed
around Naruto.</p><P>"Destroy Target,"
the robot said as it rushed at Naruto delivering a slow but strong
punch.</p><P>"Hmm too slow,"
Naruto said as he dodged out of the way and striked it with his
staff. "What the hell," Naruto said as the robot just stood there
not effected by the attack.</p><P>"Destroy Target,"
the robot said again as it hit Naruto strong sending him back a few
feet.</p><P>"Shit this thing is
strong," Naruto said as he jumped back. "Long distance it is,"
Naruto said as he channeled more chakra into the staff. "<U>Wind
Element: Razor Blades</U>," Naruto shouted as wind disks started to
form around him and shoot out toward the robot.</p><P>"Defensive
Maneuvers," the robot said as it opened up its armor to show holes.
In those holes were rockets which soon shot out and stopped every one
of Naruto's attacks.</p><P>"Damn what is this
creature… even I've never seen anything like it," Naruto said
as the robot slowly advanced up to him. "Time to go all out then,"
Naruto said as he pulled out another staff. "Kyuubi told me not to
do this but I have no choice Double Weapon effect," Naruto shouted
as both staffs gave off a tremendous amount of power.</p><P>"Error, Error, Target
Power Levels are increasing (Part I added for fun) Target's power
level is over 9000," the robot said as it stepped back once.</p><P>"I'll do this
again, <U>Wind Element: Razor Blades,"</U> Naruto shouted making
twice as many wind blades appear only this time they were spinning
way faster and were 2 times bigger as well. "Go," Naruto said as
he swung both his staffs down releasing additional energy to attack
to robot with.</p><P>"Must Retreat, Must
Retrea…" was the last thing the robot summon creature said.</p><P>"For a first time
summon that thing was strong," Naruto said as he stood up panting.</p><P>"Naruto I'm back,"
Kyuubi said as she jumped back to Naruto.</p><P>"Did you get that
talisman he had?" Naruto asked Kyuubi.</p><P>"No… I only got the
scroll… someone else came in he smelled of snakes and took the
talisman and killed Mizuki right there. I tried to go after him but
the talisman started to shine brightly and I couldn't move…
sorry," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"It's alright…
for now I guess we need to find out what that was," Naruto said as
he put the scroll on his back and headed to the Hokage's tower.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"I want you to find
Mizuki now," the Hokage said in front of a bunch of nin.</p><P>"Hai," they all
yelled only to stop when they saw Naruto appear in a gust of wind
with Kyuubi.</p><P>"Oji-san we need to
talk," Naruto said as he put the scroll in front of Sarutobi.</p><P>"Very well…
everyone is dismissed," Sarutobi said making all the nin disappear.</p><P>At the office.</p><P>"Who wrote this
scroll?" Naruto asked as he set the scroll down in front of
Sarutobi.</p><P>"It was written by
many people of this village… why do you ask?" Sarutobi asked.</p><P>"Because there is an
art of summoning from <I>our world</I> in this scroll," Naruto said
not noticing Sarutobi flinch when Naruto said our world.</p><P>"…Well we did have
a stranger visit this village a long time ago. It was when I was
still a genin he arrived here," Sarutobi began. "He had blond
hair and also claimed to be what you call a Craftknight. He also said
he was a summoner and showed us so by using strange techniques to
summon creatures from different worlds. His name was Fencer Sotel and
he stayed with us for at least 20 years… He was a great help to the
village but he left as suddenly as he came one day and we haven't
heard from him since. The only thing that people remember him by now
is in this scroll right here," Sarutobi said as he patted the
scroll.</p><P>"So ji-san came to
this world before he lived in our world," Naruto said surprised.</p><P>"Well during that
time I did feel a rip in the worlds so that was how our worlds mixed
together getting stray summons. As for me and the 8 other biju we
came here somehow," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"I see… I'm going
to have to think over this for tonight," Naruto said as he walked
out of the office.</p><P>"Wait for me,"
Kyuubi said as she followed after Naruto.</p><P>"Do you still not
feel at home here Naruto?" Sarutobi asked in a sad voice before
continuing his paper work.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Meanwhile</p><P>"Hahaha I finally
have it! Now I can summon my own army that will obey my every
command," a man said as he started to laugh in a sinister way.</p><P>"So how does that
thing work Orochimaru-sama?" another voice said.</p><P>"Quite simple yet
hard… I summon you come forth Summon creature," Orochimaru said
as he lifted the talisman up. Soon a portal appeared in front of him
and a small tank appeared in front of him.</p><P>"If I'm right…
Mizuki had something that looked stronger then this on his first
try," the other man said.</p><P>"Shut up Kabuto…"
the other man said clearly disappointed on what was summoned.</p><P>A/N: Well here's the
2nd update for you people. Well I hope I get as many
reviews and even more then last time… but 6 reviews in one day for
me is quite the record… especially for the first release so I think
those first 6 reviewers that reviewed for this story:
<B>Lighting-Squall, Irishfighter, Bobboky, raziel44. Kuroy, and
blood-angel 666.</B></p><P>Well time for some
explanations.</p><P>1: I forgot the last
name of Edgar but I remember something of edge fencer so I went with
Fencer as the last name</p><P>2: Those moves he
pulled off are not from the game… As for the dual wielding
something I thought about and to not make Naruto super powerful. When
Naruto does dual wield for a double effect his body takes immense
strain and will slowly destroy itself.</p><P>3: About Tenten's
weapon I'm not sure what to make it… I'm so far thinking of
making it a spear but I'll put up a poll</p><P>4: Same as above but
I'm thinking of making it a sword</p><P>5: Been a while since I
played the game so I forgot the chant they use to summon a creature…
besides it doesn't go on about how they summon a creature so I made
it up no harm there right?</p><P>Poll:</p><P>#1 Should Naruto stick
with Kyuubi Pairing or have a harem or something? But he stil has to
have Kyuubi</p><P>#2 What should Tenten's
weapon be Spear or something else</p><P>#3 What should Shino's
weapon be Sword or something else</p><P>#4 Should Naruto have
Mono-shift or a power similar to it</p><P>Well I'm done here so
REVIEW NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! please</p>

Naruto or Summon night swordcraft story 2 or the moves from Final
fantasy 3(from jap) but I do own the moves that I make up.</p><P>"Wake up you sleepy
head!!" Naruto heard a voice said before he jumped out of bed
dodging some Kunai's.</p><P>"What the hell was
that for?" Naruto asked as he was hanging upside down from the
ceiling looking at Kyuubi.</p><P>"Well… since I
can't seem to hit you with my own punches I thought I would use
something we made in order to help me attack you," Kyuubi said as
she pulled back her hand making the kunai's go back into her hand.</p><P>"Oh no… not those
kunai's…" Naruto said as he started to sweat a bit.</p><P>"Yup," Kyuubi said
before hurling the kunai's at Naruto which moved in an intricate
pattern.</p><P>"Sometimes I hate my
creative mind," Naruto said as he dropped down from the ceiling and
dodged the Kunai's thrown by Kyuubi. This lasted 30 minutes before
both stopped.</p><P>"Warm ups over Naruto
go take a shower now," Kyuubi said as she walked out of the room.</p><P>"Geeze can't we
have a normal warm up for once," Naruto said as he started to take
off his clothes on the way to the bathroom.</p><P>10 minutes later.</p><P>"Yo Kyu-chan I'm
ready are you?" Naruto asked as he jumped back dodging a kunai.</p><P>"I'm doing fine
Naruto… but I'm pretty sure you won't be if you keep on calling
me that," Kyuubi said as a maleficent dark red aura appeared around
her.</p><P>"You can stop now…"
Naruto said as he watched the aura dissipate.</p><P>"True… well you
better hurry academy starts in 5 minutes," Kyuubi said as she
turned into a small fox before jumping onto Naruto's shoulder.</p><P>"I'll make it there
in 2," Naruto said as he ran out of the house with a piece of toast
in his mouth.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Safe," Naruto said
as he ran into his classroom causing everyone to stare at him.
"What?" Naruto asked as he just walked up the rows of seats until
he sat next to Shino.</p><P>"I see you made it on
time," Shino said quietly to Naruto.</p><P>"Yeah… we had a bit
of a morning training session," Naruto said as he motioned towards
Kyuubi who was wrapped around his neck like his scarf.</p><P>"I see… well do you
think we'll be on the same team today?" Shino asked.</p><P>"Maybe… hopefully
yes," Naruto said as he leaned back in his chair to sleep. "Wake
me when they call my name," Naruto said as he dozed off going to
his mindscape.</p><P>"You're here I
see," Kyuubi said as Naruto appeared in front of her.</p><P>"Well I was getting
bored of doing nothing in class," Naruto said as he started
stretching.</p><P>"Since you're here
we should work on your mastery over the other elements. After all you
did master wind practically so let's start with fire now," Kyuubi
said as her hand became engulfed in a dark red fire. "I'll keep
on attacking you until you can manipulate fire to your hand a bit,"
Kyuubi said as she started to run toward Naruto.</p><P>"Unfair," Naruto
said as he started to gather his chakra around his arm only to
produce nothing.</p><P>"You're too slow,"
Kyuubi said as she managed to hit Naruto sending him back.</p><P>"HOTTTTT!!!!!"
Naruto yelled as he flipped backwards to land on his feet. "This is
actually tough," Naruto said as he started to dodge Kyuubi's
attacks while manipulating his chakra.</p><P>"Come on Naruto…
you mastered wind already so this should be able to master this
quickly," Kyuubi said as she punched Naruto again.</p><P>"This is getting
old," Naruto said as he jumped far away from Kyuubi before he
channeled his chakra again. "Come on fire," Naruto said as he
frantically started to channel more chakra. This time though he
channeled his chakra gathering it in one spot above his hand in great
quantities and concentration.</p><P>"Still too slow,"
Kyuubi said as she had her fist ready right above his head.</p><P>"GAH," Naruto let
out as he closed his eyes expecting the punch only it didn't
arrive.</p><P>"Well it's a
start," Naruto heard Kyuubi say. When he opened his eyes he saw a
small fire in the middle of his hand which looked like it was going
to go out in a manner of seconds.</p><P>"Ehhh…. It's only
this small…" Naruto said in a crestfallen manner.</p><P>"Baka it's your
first try and you're not supposed to have a fire element affinity
so it should be unnatural," Kyuubi said as the flames around her
arm disappeared. "I think your friend is calling to you now,"
Kyuubi said as Naruto felt himself waking up.</p><P>"All right let's go
out," Naruto said as he disappeared.</p><P>"Wait up," Kyuubi
said as she disappeared also.</p><P>"Naruto wake up your
name's been called," Shino said silently as he started to shake
him awake.</p><P>"I'm awake I'm
awake," Naruto said drowsily as he woke up.</p><P>"Seems like you're
on team 7 with…" Shino began to say as Iruka spoke up.</p><P>"…Sakura and Sasuke
your jounin sensei will be Kakashi Hatatake," Iruka said before he
read the other team assignments.</p><P>"Aw man looks like
we're on the same team," Naruto said crestfallen.</p><P>"Well we can still
meet more likely," Shino said trying to look on the positive side.</p><P>"I guess… I just
hope I survive with the people on my team," Naruto said.</p><P>'I agree… that
Sasuke thinks he's all high and mighty with the Sharingan and being
the only one in the village to have one now… and that Sakura is
just a frantic fan girl,' Kyuubi thought to Naruto which Naruto
concurred to.</p><P>"Well I better just
go to sleep now," Naruto said out loud before he fell asleep.</p><P>"You're so
carefree…" Shino said in a bit of a envious voice.</p><P>"Why do I have to put
up with that Baka," Sakura said as she saw Naruto fall asleep.</p><P>"A dobe and a fangirl
not good," Sasuke said in a groan.</p><P>"Ramen…" Naruto
said before he fell into deep slumber.</p><P>"…" Everyone just
remained quiet after that comment.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"3 hours!!!! And he
still hasn't shown himself," Sakura pratically yelled out.</p><P>"…" Sasuke
remained quiet but was clearly pissed off.</p><P>"It's hot…"
Naruto said while sleeping getting two weird looks from his
teammates. As for Naruto he was going under a fiery hell in his
mindscape.</p><P>"Is this team 7?" a
voice said before a white haired man with a mask and a head band
covering one of his eyes (Which eye was it…)</p><P>"Are you our jounin
sensei?" Sakura asked</p><P>"And if I said yes?"
Kakashi asked receiving minor killer intent from Sasuke and Sakura.
"Well… I am your jounin teacher and my first impression of you
guys is I hate you. Wake up your teammate and bring him up to the
roof," Kakashi said disappearing in a puff of smoke.</p><P>"Gah… I'll kill
our sensei!!!" Sakura yelled waking Naruto up.</p><P>"Huh is our sensei
here?" Naruto asked receiving two glares from his teammates.</p><P>"Rooftop so we can
kill!!!" Sakura yelled running up the stairs.</p><P>"Hmph," Sasuke said
as he followed Sakura up.</p><P>"I guess I should
follow," Naruto said as he felt his body warm up. "Still no
control," Naruto said as a bit of smoke came off his body before he
it stopped.</p><P>"You'll learn,"
Kyuubi said as she wrapped around Naruto's neck.</p><P>"I know I will,"
Naruto said as he disappeared in a gust of wind.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Hmm they're not
here yet," Kakashi said as he read his book.</p><P>"Sakura said to meet
up here right?" Naruto said as he appeared next to Kakashi
suddenly.</p><P>"Yes they did,"
Kakashi said as he put away his book. 'This kid is interesting,'
Kakashi thought as the other two teammates came into view.</p><P>"How did you get here
before us?" Sakura asked previous anger forgotten.</p><P>"…Hmph she's
right how did you get here before us you should still be in the
room," Sasuke said.</p><P>"Well… I just did,"
Naruto said getting sweat drops from everyone.</p><P>"Well anyway let's
get on with the introductions," Kakashi said, "Just introduce
yourselves," Kakashi said.</p><P>"Why don't you go
first sensei?" Sakura asked.</p><P>"Well my name is
Kakashi… my dreams… hobbies… likes…"</p><P>'we only got his
name,' everyone thought before Kakashi pointed at Sakura.</p><P>"You go first,"
Kakashi said as he pointed to Sakura.</p><P>"My name is Sakura…
my likes are she looks toward Sasuke dreams Sasuke again goal
looks at Sasuke and blushes," Sakura said.</p><P>'Ok we got a bit more
info then Kakashi but still,' Naruto and Sasuke thought.</p><P>"You brooding one,"
Kakashi said as he pointed at Sasuke.</p><P>"My name is Sasuke
but I have no dreams or likes I only have one goal to kill a certain
person…" Sasuke said before he finished.</p><P>"Finally you cheery
one," Kakashi said as he pointed at Naruto before noticing the fox
around his neck. 'a kitsune,' Kakashi thought before he pondered
over the situation.</p><P>"My name is Naruto my
likes are my family, and this kitsune Kyu. My dislikes are people who
use summon creatures for bad doings. My goal is to become stronger
then my brother who is still stronger then me. As for my dream… I
don't exactly know," Naruto said as he finished.</p><P>"All right everyone
we'll meet at training ground number 7 tomorrow morning for a
survival test. Oh and don't eat because you'll just throw up,"
Kakashi said before he puffed out of the room.</p><P>"Ok well see ya guys
I need to go train," Naruto said as he jumped off the roof.</p><P>"What's that baka
doing?" Sakura asked as she went over to the area Naruto jumped
off.</p><P>"Dope," Sasuke said
as he went over to where Sakura went also.</p><P>"Hey he's not
here," Sakura said looking down.</p><P>"Huh?" Sasuke said
clearly confused. 'That dope couldn't have done anything could
he?' Sasuke thought</p><P>Meanwhile in the air.</p><P>"Flying is always
interesting," Naruto said as he looked at the two teammates looking
for him.</p><P>"Don't do this too
often or else you'll die of chakra exhaustion," Kyuubi said
jumping onto Naruto's head in her fox form.</p><P>"Well time to go
create a weapon for a fire affinity," Naruto said as he flew
towards his house.</p><P>"Fine… we need to
improve your control anyway," Kyuubi said as she turned to her
human form dropping down with Naruto.</p><P>"Now what to make,"
Naruto said as he entered his house with Kyuubi.</p><P>"Have you found
anything new to make a weapon with?" Kyuubi asked making Naruto
stop dead and fall over.</p><P>"…I forgot… I
think I should find something other then steel, and iron, and other
materials," Naruto said. "I forgot, a craftknight has to go out
and find his materials," Naruto said as Kyuubi came up behind him.</p><P>"I'm pretty sure
there are some rare materials that you can't find in our world if
we look hard enough," Kyuubi said as she started to pick up some
kunai's that were lying around.</p><P>"So what's a good
place to look?" Naruto asked as he picked up a pick and a duffle
bag.</p><P>"Let's try to find
a volcano… we might some rock in the magma which I can reach into,"
Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Alright let's go,"
Naruto said enthusiastically.</p><P>"Problem is I don't
know of any here," Kyuubi said making Naruto fall down again. "So
we'll have to deal with the mountains nearby and hopefully find
something rare," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Sure…" Naruto
said weakly as he walked outside.</p><P>"Geeze he's happy
at one moment then depressed the next," Kyuubi said before she
followed Naruto outside.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Do you think we can
get past the guard?" Naruto asked as he looked around.</p><P>"Don't worry…
I'll just use a spell I've recently created to get us out of here
with little notice," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Really?!?!?"
Naruto asked.</p><P>"Sure… hold onto
this," Kyuubi said as she gave Naruto her talisman.</p><P>"Huh why?" Naruto
asked as Kyuubi had an evil smirk on her face.</p><P>"Naruto prepare for a
rough landing, <U>Force Blast,</U>" Kyuubi shouted sending a blast
of pure mana sending Naruto into the air and out of sight of Konoha.</p><P>"What do you think
that was?" one of the guards said.</p><P>"Well certainly not
an invader or anything so I don't think we need to worry for now,"
the second guard said.</p><P>"You're right after
all nothing interesting ever happens here," the first guard said
before he returned to looking at the Konoha forest.</p><P>"I really need to do
that more often," Kyuubi said before she disappeared from view.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Someplace faraway</p><P>"Damn Kyu-chan I
shouldn't have trusted her," Naruto said as he got up and dusted
himself. "I wonder why she never told me she had such an attack,"
Naruto said as he looked around. He was in some kind of mountainous
barren place. "Although this place might have some valuable
materials for crafting,"</p><P>"I'm here,"
Kyuubi said as she appeared next to Naruto in a red flash.</p><P>"Where'd you learn
that," Naruto said as he looked at Kyuubi with an angry face.</p><P>"I'm over 10000
years old so I learn things while I lived," Kyuubi said while
looking around. "I see this place should have something interesting
if we look," Kyuubi said as she walked around.</p><P>"So you sense
something?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"Well… it feels as
if the ores around here have some kind of chakra retaining property
in them… although a place like this would most likely attract some
demons," Kyuubi said. "In this form I can only support you so
you'll have to do all the work Craftknight," Kyuubi said in a
seductive voice.</p><P>"So unfair…
although that is one of the facts of being a craftknight. To go out
and find materials to make better weapons… and if you're correct
then I'll be able to make superior weapons with this ore. Let's
go Kyu-chan," Naruto said as he walked off.</p><P>"Problem is how are
you going to get inside?" Kyuubi asked. Naruto stopped and realized
there was no entrance or anything.</p><P>"You got to stop
doing that Kyu-chan," Naruto said as he caught himself from
falling.</p><P>"But it's so fun.
Anyway this shouldn't be too much of a problem… I could probably
change your chakra structure with mine and make it similar to that of
Nina's (1)," Kyuubi began to say.</p><P>"You mean like ghost
Nina-chan… I never knew you could do that," Naruto said in
amazement.</p><P>"Yeah just like how
she was separated from her body because of that one spirit. I think I
can emulate the effect only changing your whole body like Nina's
for a brief period of time," Kyuubi said. "But the bad thing is
your body might permanently stay that of a ghost properties,"
Kyuubi said</p><P>"Well… at least I
can go and bother people like my brother without him hitting me,"
Naruto said and looked at Kyuubi. "Let's do this," Naruto said.</p><P>"I just hope I
remember what Nina's power was like." Kyuubi said before she put
her hand on Naruto. "Just remember you agreed to this," Kyuubi
said as Naruto felt Kyuubi's chakra overtake his body and change it
a bit.</p><P>"I feel so strange,"
Naruto said as he felt his body started to change. His hair turned a
lighter yellow and his body turned transparent before he started to
sink into the ground. "Gah I'm sinking," Naruto said as he soon
disappeared from Kyuubi's sight.</p><P>"This might cause a
problem," Kyuubi said as Naruto was nowhere in sight. "I just
hope he learns how to control that form for now," Kyuubi said as
she flashed out of the area.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>With Naruto</p><P>"How do I stop
falling," Naruto said as he saw layer and layer of rock go past him
as he kept falling. "Maybe I should use my chakra like the tree
climbing exercise," Naruto said as he gathered his chakra or tried
to. "What the," Naruto said as he felt his chakra feel different
from before. His chakra had a softer feeling to it and instead of the
regular blue chakra out came a transparent white color.</p><P>"I hope this works
like regular chakra," Naruto said as he gathered the chakra all
over his body effectively making him stop. "Sugoi this is so cool,"
Naruto said as he was floating in mid air in a cavern.</p><P>"I guess I forgot to
warn you of that," Kyuubi said as she appeared below Naruto.</p><P>"You know you should
explain something more thoroughly next time," Naruto said as he
descended to the ground.</p><P>"At least you figured
out how to do something that I don't even know how to do," Kyuubi
said.</p><P>"So how do I change
back?" Naruto asked getting a gasp out of Kyuubi. "Please don't
tell me you didn't think this out too?" Naruto said in more of a
statement then a question.</p><P>"Hehe my fault,"
Kyuubi said as she stuck out her tongue while rubbing the back of her
head.</p><P>sigh "There's got
to be a way to change back," Naruto said as he walked up to Kyuubi.</p><P>"Hey since you're a
ghost how are your stuff still on you?" Kyuubi asked getting a
confused look out of Naruto.</p><P>"How are my stuff
still on me?" Naruto asked as he reached in his duffle bag to pull
out the pick.</p><P>"I guess it has
something to do with first your chakra and maybe when I engulfed you
in my chakra," Kyuubi said as she reached out and touched Naruto.</p><P>"Hmm… for now let's
just keep on walking and try to think of a way to turn you back…
after all we did come here for," Kyuubi said trying to sound
optimistic.</p><P>"Fine…" Naruto
said floating in mid air. "This is kind of fun," Naruto said
while 'walking' in mid air.</p><P>"Seems like we're
closing in the area where the ores are," Kyuubi said as they saw a
cavern up ahead glowing with an array of colors.</p><P>"It feels strong,"
Naruto said as he felt a bit lightheaded.</p><P>"It's giving off
too much power I see," Kyuubi said as she saw Naruto flash going
from transparent to normal and back to being transparent.</p><P>"This transformation
is based on chakra… I guess I can actually change back. Maybe if I
use those ores to help me," Naruto said as he rushed into cavern.</p><P>"Wait up… there
might be something in there," Kyuubi said as she ran after Naruto.
"I told you to wait," Kyuubi said only to see Naruto looking at
something.</p><P>"Huge…" Naruto
said as he pointed at a huge green crystal which had a head and a
body.</p><P>"Isn't that a
summon creature?" Kyuubi asked and received an answer.</p><P>"Yes… I was
summoned here to protect this area from intruders such as yourselves.
If you do not leave I will have to deal with you two," the crystal
creature said.</p><P>"Wait summoned here?
Who were you summoned by?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"I was summoned by a
man who had the last name of Fencer that is all you need to know,"
the summon said as it got into a fighting position.</p><P>"If we beat you can
we take the ore and get some info out of you?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"If you can," the
creature said as it rushed forward.</p><P>"Kyu-chan
<U>Quickening</U>," Naruto shouted as he jumped up.</p><P>"Right," Kyuubi
said as she used her magic on Naruto.</p><P>"Huh?" Naruto said
as he saw himself get enchanted but didn't feel the effects.
"What's going on," Naruto said as the creature came closer.</p><P>"It must be that form
of yours… it's blocking out my support magic," Kyuubi said
frantically thinking of something to do.</p><P>"Well we have no
choice but to deal with this guy normally then," Naruto said as he
flew towards the creature to be hit back by the sheer force of the
creatures attack.</p><P>"This one's
strong," Kyuubi said as she jumped over the creature throwing
Kunai's which didn't effect the creature at all.</p><P>"What do we do?"
Naruto asked as he drew Soul Harmony. "As long as I'm able to
hold a weapon I'll be fine," Naruto said as his transparent
chakra that covered his body covered the sword. "Take this,"
Naruto said as he struck down with his might sending the creature
back.</p><P>"That must have been
a strong hit," Kyuubi said as the creature had difficulty standing
up.</p><P>"I don't know why
but I feel stronger in this form… although it is taxing on my
chakra to keep it around me all the time," Naruto said as he
started to breathe heavily.</p><P>"You have a humongous
chakra supply so it shouldn't be drained that quickly should it,"
Kyuubi said.</p><P>"…I don't know
but it feels like just holding Soul Harmony drains my chakra more…
must be because of the overcoat of my chakra," Naruto said as he
put down the sword. "Ah much better," Naruto said as he
stretched.</p><P>"You are strong… it
has been 20 years since I've had a battle of this caliber…" the
creature said as it stood up.</p><P>"I'm glad you're
enjoying this battle also," Naruto said as he started to experiment
with his chakra. "I just hope I can use this form to it's maximum
potential," Naruto said as he ran towards the creature.</p><P>"I'm not as slow as
I look," the creature said as it disappeared and appeared behind
Naruto.</p><P>"Crap," Naruto said
as he felt a hard blow to the head. "That didn't hurt that much,"
Naruto said as he stood up. "Seems like I have an unconscious
chakra reaction or something," Naruto said as he examined his
chakra more. "One more time," Naruto said as he charged at the
creature again.</p><P>"Such tactics won't
work on me," the creature said as it disappeared and reappeared
behind Naruto. "I'll end this now," the creature said as it
swung it's fist which turned into a spear like arm.</p><P>"I don't think so,"
Naruto said as his chakra withdrew leaving only a transparent Naruto
which the spear went through not damaging him at all. "I knew it,"
Naruto said as he started to pant even more. "Although that took up
too much chakra," Naruto said as he floated up before the chakra
over coated him.</p><P>"I see," Kyuubi
said as she too jumped up with Naruto.</p><P>"Kyu-chan use a <U>Blaze
shot</U>," Naruto said as he flew towards the creature.</p><P>"That seems stupid
but all right," Kyuubi said as she gathered some fire into her
hands before making it bigger and shooting it at the creature.</p><P>"My first ghost move
I guess <U>Chakra Impact,</U>" Naruto shouted gathering his chakra
to his hand hitting the creature and making the fire ball go through
him.</p><P>"That's gotta
hurt," Kyuubi said as she landed next to Naruto.</p><P>"I think I used too
much chakra," Naruto said as he started to shine before his body
became untransparent(not sure of a word) and his hair turned back to
its regular color.</p><P>"Looks like you used
too much chakra," Kyuubi said as she helped Naruto to his feet.</p><P>"But we defeated the
summon and that's all that matters," Naruto said as he went over
to the summon.</p><P>"I am defeated…
very well I shall allow you to mine in here for chakra ore(can't
think of anything good…)</p><P>"Thank you…"
Naruto said as he went over to the wall and examined it. "Sugoi so
much ores," Naruto said as he started to swing his pick axe.</p><P>"This is going to
take a while," Kyuubi said as she helped out.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>1 hour later.</p><P>"I think this should
be enough," Naruto said as he put in the remaining ores into the
duffle bag.</p><P>"Let's go,"
Kyuubi said as she grabbed Naruto's hand.</p><P>"Wait… before you
go take this," the summon said as it handed Naruto a crystal the
same color it was. "I was told by the previous summoner to help the
one that would defeat me. That ore you hold will allow you to summon
me to help you,"</p><P>"Thank you," Naruto
said as he accepted the crystal. "By the way what should I call
you?" Naruto aksed.</p><P>"Just call me
Adament," Adament said.</p><P>"We better go back if
we're to make it before it gets dark," Kyuubi said as she grabbed
Naruto.</p><P>"Let's go,"
Naruto said as Kyuubi and Naruto teleported out of there.</p><P>"Another great one
from the Fencer family," Adament said before sitting down and
sleeping.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Ah it's too late
to make a weapon now," Naruto said in a whiny voice as he looked at
the time.</p><P>"Well today was a
rough day so I wouldn't be surprised," Kyuubi said as she walked
in.</p><P>"At least I found a
new form or something like that… I wonder if I can go ghost like
again… although it sucks to not be able to mold my chakra outside
of my body for jutsu's," Naruto said.</p><P>"Although it does
give you a boost for most of your chakra reserves," Kyuubi said
adding in.</p><P>"Ahh… I need to
find a way to change back to that form… after all it might give me
a fighting edge over Edgar-nii-san," Naruto said before he landed
on his bed.</p><P>"Good night Naruto
Kyuubi said only to see Naruto already asleep. "All the better for
me," Kyuubi said as she crawled into his bed giving him a kiss.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Oi Kyu-chan I just
realized something," Naruto said as he finished eating breakfast.</p><P>"What is it?"
Kyuubi asked.</p><P>"Kakashi-sensei never
told us when to meet," Naruto said.</p><P>"I see… lets just
go there later," Kyuubi said as Naruto relaxed.</p><P>"That's probably a
good idea," Naruto said as he slowly got up and went to the forge.</p><P>"Don't tell me
you're going to work on it now," Kyuubi asked.</p><P>"Well I've got to
see how this ore works," Naruto said as he pulled out the ore from
yesterday out of nowhere.</p><P>"I wonder how you
pull things out of nowhere…" Kyuubi said as she followed Naruto
downstairs.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"They are both late,"
Sakura said as she started to get angry.</p><P>"…" Sasuke said
nothing but had on a pissed face.</p><P>"This is where we are
supposed to meet right?" Naruto asked as he came into view behind
the two.</p><P>"Gah don't do
that," Sakura yelled as she jumped up into the air like a cat.</p><P>"Why I'm just
greeting you guys," Naruto said.</p><P>"Dope what's that
on your hand?" Sasuke asked as he saw a shield on Naruto's hand.</p><P>"It's a shield
moron in case you can't see," Naruto said as he lifted his right
hand showing the shield that was attached to his arm.</p><P>"What's with the
weird markings?" Sasuke pressed further.</p><P>"A secrete," Naruto
said as he leaned against the tree.</p><P>"Yo I see everyone's
here," Kakashi said as he appeared.</p><P>"FINALLY I WAS
GETTING TIRED," Sakura said as she yelled at Kakashi.</p><P>"Sorry but I was
helping this…" Kakashi began only to shut up when he saw the
glares he recived from Sasuke and Sakura. "Well anyway your test
today is to get these two bells from me. Those who can't will be
sent back to the academy," Kakashi said.</p><P>"But sensei there's
only two," Sakura said.</p><P>"That is why you need

Naruto or Summon night swordcraft story 2 or the moves from Final
fantasy 3(from jap) but I do own the moves that I make up.</p><P>"So the test is just
to steal a bell?!?!? That's a bit easy," Naruto said as he hid in
a tree.</p><P>"Well this test is
supposed to be for those fresh out of academy kids so there must be
another meaning to this test," Kyuubi said as she sat next to
Naruto in her human form.</p><P>"… please don't
tell me I have to cooperate with two people who don't even
acknowledge my existence," Naruto said as he saw Sasuke engage
Kakashi.</p><P>"Well… looking at
how Sasuke is doing most gennin wouldn't even be able to touch
Kakashi so yes," Kyuubi said as she stood up.</p><P>"Oh well… might as
well have some fun before I have them help… after all I need to run
a test drive on this new shield," Naruto said as he held up the
shield.</p><P>"What kind of effect
did you put on the shield? Even I couldn't tell… especially when
you asked me to put in limiting seals on it," Kyuubi said as she
studied the shield.</p><P>"I'll give you a
hint… it has the same properties as the chakra ore," Naruto said
as he jumped off the tree.</p><P>"Gah… that's no
help," Kyuubi said as she followed suite.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Sasuke was not having a
good day. First he was put on the same team with a dope and a fangirl
who kept on bothering him. Second he had to wait 4 hours with Sakura.
Third he had lost to Kakashi and had his body buried up to his head.
Finally he saw the dope of his class actually pushing Kakashi back.</p><P>"Naruto you're
pretty good…" Kakashi said as he dodged another slash from
Naruto's Soul Harmony.</p><P>"Well I've been
training with the best from where I come from so that's no
surprise," Naruto said as he jumped back making Kyuubi jump above
him and attack with some kunai's.</p><P>"I don't remember
you being on my team," Kakashi said as he retaliated from her
attack with some kunai's of his own.</p><P>"She's my guardian
beast. You know the fox you saw earlier so I'm guessing she can
fight also because most attacks we do are combinations," Naruto
said as he dashed forward to slash.</p><P>"I see… well I
guess I should stop fooling around," Kakashi said as he started to
do some hand signs.</p><P>"Finally taking me
serious I see," Naruto said as he continued running towards
Kakashi.</p><P>"<U>Katon: Goukakyuu
no Jutsu</U>," Kakashi yelled as he jumped back and blew out a fire
ball to Naruto.</p><P>"Huge! I guess I
should use my newest creation," Naruto said as he threw his sword
up in the air and brought his right hand forward. "<U>Absorption</U>,"
Naruto shouted as he blocked the fire ball with his shield. The
fireball soon dissipated leaving a slightly winded Naruto.</p><P>"Nani!!! How did that
happen?" Kakashi asked as he stood shellshocked.</p><P>"I think you should
be more worried about yourself," Naruto shouted as Kakashi looked
up to see Soul Harmony in Kyuubi's hands who was coming down rather
quickly.</p><P>"Take this, <U>Human
soul: Weapon overcoat</U>," Kyuubi shouted as blue chakra seemed to
flow from Naruto to the sword and Kyuubi covering them completely.</p><P>"I'm pretty sure I
don't want to get hit by that," Kakashi said as he jumped away
quickly just in time to avoid an explosion from the impact of the
sword.</p><P>"Darn I missed,"
Kyuubi said ignoring the shocked looks from Kakashi and Sasuke.</p><P>"Oh well… let's
try another method," Naruto said as he put his shield on his back
and pulled out the Kitsune claws. "Claw and claw?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"Claw and claw,"
Kyuubi said as she put Soul Harmony on the ground and made her hands
turn into claws.</p><P>'These two have great
teamwork,' Kakashi thought as he saw both of them run at him while
weaving.</p><P>"10 strikes," both
shouted as they disappeared and reappeared behind Kakashi. At first
nothing happened but then in the place of Kakashi was a log which
split into tiny pieces.</p><P>"Damn I was a bit too
slow there," Naruto said as he sat down.</p><P>"You shouldn't use
too much chakra next time," Kyuubi said as she sat next to Naruto.</p><P>"Well Kakashi
probably is somewhere else by now," Naruto said as he looked over
to Sasuke.</p><P>"Yeah… maybe we
should have gone for a Boost attack," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Maybe" Naruto said
as he walked over to Sasuke. "I'll let you out only if you agree
to work as a team," Naruto said as he sat in front of Sasuke's
head.</p><P>"No," Sasuke said
plain out.</p><P>"You'll be stuck in
there for quite some time then," Naruto said still sitting.</p><P>"I don't need help
from a dope like you," Sasuke said as he still resisted.</p><P>"Your loss baka,"
Kyuubi said as she stood up.</p><P>"You don't know the
point of this test do you?" Naruto asked as he too stood up.</p><P>"What do you mean?
All you have to do is steal a bell from Kakashi and you get to be a
gennin," Sasuke said confidently.</p><P>"Correct but… can a
gennin really steal a bell from Kakashi?" Naruto asked making
Sasuke put on a confused look.</p><P>:"The answer is no
baka," Kyuubi said enraging Sasuke.</p><P>"Gah let me out of
here so I can beat you up!" Sasuke yelled.</p><P>"It's best if you
don't try," Naruto said as he put his hands in a seal and yelled
Kai.</p><P>"Dope… I know I'll
regret this but what's the plan?" Sasuke asked as he looked over
at the two.</p><P>"We need to get
Sakura first," Naruto said as he picked up Soul Harmony handing it
to Kyuubi. "I need to test this shield out some more," Naruto
said as he put the shield over his gloves.</p><P>"Fine," Kyuubi said
as she put Soul Harmony onto her back with the words Human still
glowing on it.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>It was quiet too quiet
from what Kakashi had thought. It had been well over 20 minutes since
he had attacked Sakura and there had been no response from the other
two teammates as well. 'looks like another failed team,' Kakashi
thought as he suddenly jumped back.</p><P>"Take this,"
Kakashi heard as he saw Sasuke come out behind him and shoot a
fireball out of his mouth.</p><P>"This again… it
won't work," Kakashi said as he got ready to Shushin.</p><P>"Maybe but it'll
work if you get distracted," Naruto said as he appeared above
Kakashi with Kyuubi next to him. "<U>Double Driver</U>," Naruto
and Kyuubi shouted as they both rushed at Kakashi with their claws.</p><P>"Shit," Kakashi
whispered as he quickly made some seals and dived into the ground.</p><P>"Sakura now,"
Naruto shouted causing Sakura who was hiding in a nearby tree to
shoot out some kunais with ninja wire ensnaring Kakashi.</p><P>"I think you should
give," Kyuubi said as Kakashi struggled to get out of the wires.</p><P>"You won't be able
to break them, they're made from a special ore from my hometown
which is practically indestructible… although it can only be used
to forge small weapons," Naruto said in a small voice.</p><P>"I see… well get me
out of here so I can tell you guys something," Kakashi said as the
three ninja's and Summon beast went over to help Kakashi out.
After going back to the starting place Kakashi spoke again. "What
was the purpose of this test?" Kakashi asked.</p><P>"Teamwork," all
three ninja's replied getting Kakashi to give them a smirk.</p><P>"Good… meet me here
tomorrow at 8 am so we can start training," Kakashi said before he
vanished in a puff of smoke.</p><P>"All right finally,"
Naruto said as he stretched himself.</p><P>"That was a good
warm-up," Kyuubi said as she too started stretching.</p><P>'That was a warm-up?'
Both Sakura and Sasuke thought.</p><P>"Neh Kyu-chan want to
get some ramen?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"Heh… I'll let
this one slide for now since you actually asked me nicely," Kyuubi
said as she turned into a fox and jumped onto Naruto's shoulder.</p><P>"Alright let's go,"
Naruto said as he too vanished in a puff of smoke.</p><P>"That's Naruto?"
Sakura asked in shock.</p><P>"…" Sasuke was
speechless also.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So… I saw a
glimpse of what the shield does but it seems too powerful just to
absorb an attack like that," Kyuubi said as she sat next to Naruto
in her human form.</p><P>"Well you're
correct Kyu-chan after all most of the strong weapons I have come
with a strong consequence," Naruto said as he began his 3d bowl of
ramen.</p><P>"What?" Kyuubi
asked getting interested.</p><P>"Well as you saw it
does absorb chakra based attacks… but the bad thing is that is
absorbs anything that is chakra related around it… and at a fast
pace also," Naruto said as he took out the shield. "That is why I
asked you to put the seals on the shield so it can be turned on and
off like so," Naruto said as he handed the shield to Kyuubi.</p><P>"Wow… you actually
thought that far ahead?" Kyuubi asked in a shocked voice.</p><P>"Hey… I do after
all make weapons," Naruto said defending himself. "As I was
saying… the absorbed energy though seems to cumulate inside of the
shield, how much it can hold I don't know. That's the reason for
the second set of seals so that I can release the energy in the
shield into my body if needed to,"</p><P>"Oh really," Kyuubi
said as she examined the shield carefully.</p><P>"Neh Kyu-chan when do
you think we should go back?" Naruto asked with a distant look in
his eyes.</p><P>"… if you want to
go back so much why not right now?" Kyuubi asked trying to lighten
the mood.</p><P>"… I'll think
some more on this," Naruto said as he left the stand and soon
vanished from sight.</p><P>"He's over-abusing
his powers," Kyuubi said before leaving the stand.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"… I think I'm
getting homesick," Naruto said as he lied on his back in the middle
of the field looking up at the sky.</p><P>"Well you agreed to
be a ninja so I don't think you can go home anytime soon though,"
Naruto heard Kyuubi say as she appeared next to him.</p><P>"Heh… maybe I
should've just stayed home with Edgar nii-san and everyone else,"
Naruto said getting nostalgic.</p><P>"You still have me
though," Kyuubi said as she sat down next to Naruto.</p><P>"I know that
Kyu-chan," Naruto said earning a hit on the head.</p><P>"Baka…" Kyuubi
said before she got up and put out her hand for Naruto. "Come on we
still have some training to do," Kyuubi said in a happy voice.</p><P>"Thanks for
everything Kyu-chan," Naruto said as he accepted her hand and stood
up.</p><P>"Yosh now for some
training from hell," Kyuubi said as she tightened her hold on
Naruto's arm before they both vanished.</p><P>"Those two never
cease to amaze me… although it seems as if Naruto doesn't feel at
home here," Hokage said before he went back to his paper work.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"I see you managed to
make the fire move up and take up at least half of your body… your
radius for extending your fire while in control is only 10 meters but
that's good enough for now," Kyuubi said a smile on her face.</p><P>"Heh… finally,"
Naruto said as the fire around Naruto's upper body disappeared
leaving a heavily sweating and panting Naruto. "Controlling fire is
way too hard," Naruto said as he fell onto his butt while catching
his breath.</p><P>"But if you control
it then you'll be proficient in 2 elements leaving 3 more to go,"
Kyuubi said encouraging Naruto.</p><P>"Yeah… I just hope
the other elements are easier," Naruto said.</p><P>"Oh yeah… by the
way have you figured out anything about that ghost form of yours?"
Kyuubi asked out of curiosity.</p><P>"Not much… I've
tried everything I know, but it seems I don't have enough chakra to
break a barrier and change… the first time must have been a fluke,"
Naruto said as he stood up.</p><P>"I see… well we
should head back it's getting late," Kyuubi said as they looked
up to see the sun setting.</p><P>"True… I wonder
what kind of missions we'll be doing?" Naruto asked as he stood
next to Kyuubi.</p><P>"We'll find out
tomorrow won't we," Kyuubi said as she started to walk with
Naruto next to her unconsciously both held each other's hand while
they walked home.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Somewhere else</p><P>"Ok so far you've
only summoned a small green tank, a green blob, some kind of huge
purple beetle, and a yellow blob… don't you think you should
just give up?" Kabuto asked a frantic Orochimaru who held a rune in
his hand.</p><P>"NEVER I SHALL HAVE
MY ARMY," Orochimaru shouted as he proceeded with the summoing.
Soon with a swirl of blue energy a black rabbit (1) appeared in front
of him. "NOOO I summoned something stupid again," Orochimaru
shouted as he looked at the harmless looking rabbit in front of him.</p><P>"Um Orochimaru-sama…
I think you should look at that rabbit," Kabuto said before the
Rabbit pounced on Orochimaru, biting him and holding on.</p><P>"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"
Orochimaru screamed as the rabbit bit down harder.</p><P>"I think we should
let this one go also," Kabuto said as the rabbit soon disappeared.</p><P>whimper "Never
underestimate rabbits," Orochimaru kept on repeating as he entered
a fettle position.</p><P>In Edgar's world.</p><P>"Rampage rabbit where
have you been?" a kid asked as he saw his buddy rabbit come to him
with something in his mouth.</p><P>"Is that a piece of
heart boxers?" the boy asked before he decided to let go of the
subject.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So tired," Naruto
said as he fell into bed landing with a thump.</p><P>"Well I'm not
surprised after all you improved immensely from last time," Kyuubi
said as she just stood by the door.</p><P>"I know but still I'm
tired," Naruto said as he just entered his bed not bothering to
take off his clothes.</p><P>"Good night
Naruto-kun," Kyuubi said as she saw Naruto already fast asleep.
"Now for my price for training you," Kyuubi said as she went up
to Naruto and kissed him on the lips. "Taste's like ramen as
usual," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"…Kyu-chan… did
you just kiss me?" Naruto asked with his eyes closed shocking
Kyuubi.</p><P>"Heh heh…" Kyuubi
started to laugh in a weird manner.</p><P>"…why?" Naruto
asked</p><P>"Cause I feel
attracted to you and you're quite loveable. Besides you're one of
the only people that has ever been nice to me… even though I was
all powerful people only used to look up at me with fear and respect…
those who tried to court me were those who only wanted a better
reputation. You just look at me as a sensei or a normal girl which
I'm thankful for," Kyuubi said as she started to hug Naruto.</p><P>"You are my sensei
and my guardian beast which I'm thankful for also. Thanks
Kyu-chan," Naruto said as he returned her hug.</p><P>"Thank you," Kyuubi
said as the two slept in each others arms.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Flash back.</p><P>"<I>Where am I?" a
confused little Naruto said as he looked around. He seemed to be in a
sewer like complex only it had a strange feeling to it. </I></p><P>"<I><B>Come of here,"</B></I><I>
Naruto heard a voice say and decided to go to it. </I></p><P>"<I>Wow a big cage,"
Naruto exclaimed as he looked at the weird golden cage with the kanji
seal on it. </I></p><P>"<I><B>I finally get
to see my jailer up close… although he is quite puny,"</B></I><I>
Kyuubi said in her huge fox form as she stared down at Naruto. </I></p><P>"<I>Hey I'm not
that puny and just for you to know I'm going to grow up big and
strong like my tou-san," Naruto said with confidence.</I></p><P>"<I><B>Oh really? I'd
like to see you try you little shrimp," Kyuubi taunted. </B></I></p><P>"<I>I'm not a
little shrimp," Naruto yelled jumping up and down throwing a temper
tantrum.</I></p><P>'<I><B>Cute,'
Kyuubi thought as she saw the little boy jump up and down a while
longer. "Do you want power? Power so that everyone will respect you
and fear you?" Kyuubi asked.</B></I></p><P>"<I>Hmm…" Naruto
muttered as he put on a pensive look deciding the decision over.</I></p><P>"<I><B>If you say yes
then I could give you power that could make you known throughout the
land," Kyuubi said testing Naruto.</B></I></p><P>"<I>No," Naruto
replied simply with a smile on his face.</I></p><P>"<I><B>Why boy? Why
would you now want to be known or be respected?" Kyuubi asked
testing him further.</B></I></p><P>"<I>Because then it
wouldn't be my own strength. I want to be like tou-san and get to
his level without borrowing any power. As for respect… I don't
think I need that after all I'm only 7 years old and I have a
family so no," Naruto said with more confidence. As he looked up at
the giant fox he was surprised to see it shrink and turn into a
beautiful girl a few years older then him.</I></p><P>"<I>I see you pass
boy," Kyuubi said as she stared at the confused boy. "You are
worthy enough to house me so I have no objections of staying here
anymore.</I></p><P>"<I>Eh? This is
inside of me… then why is there a pretty girl inside of me?"
Naruto asked getting a small blush from Kyuubi.</I></p><P>"<I>There just is…
well my name is Kyuubi hope we can be friends," Kyuubi said in a
sweet voice.</I></p><P>"<I>Sure Kyuubi, by
the way the names Naruto, Fencer Naruto," Naruto said giving her a
fox like grin. </I></p><P><I>End flashback</I></p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Gah it's late I
forgot to get up," Kyuubi yelled as she jumped out of the bed she
was in. "Huh where's Naruto?" Kyuubi asked as she looked around
for her new almost mate.</p><P>"I think I'm late,"
Kyuubi heard Naruto say as she exited his room to find him at the
forge.</p><P>"Gah what are you
doing so early in the morning?" Kyuubi asked as Naruto had a hammer
in his arm forging something.</p><P>"Forging what does it
look like," Naruto said as he lifted his head showing sweat.</p><P>"You should've at
least told me so we could've worked on it together. I don't want
to be left out like last time," Kyuubi said as she rushed down to
meet Naruto.</p><P>"Well you were
sleeping so peacefully that I didn't want to bother you," Naruto
said as he struck the metal he was working on again.</p><P>"Gah… that doesn't
matter… anyway what are you working on?" Kyuubi asked as she
looked at the piece of metal in front of her.</p><P>"I thought I could
add my fire chakra and make something," Naruto said as he hit the
metal again.</p><P>"… it's usually
useless to make something you don't even know," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Well that's how I
made the shield," Naruto said getting a shocked face from Kyuubi.</p><P>"Gah you're
impossible. Well since its going to be a fire weapon why not a make a
quarterstaff those are pretty useful," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"…Fine I'll make
one… although it feels like we're forgetting something," Naruto
said as he continued on hitting the metal.</p><P>"Oh well probably
something insignificant anyway," Kyuubi said as she prepared to
work with Naruto.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"3 hours… 3 hours
how long does it take for a sensei and a dope to show up?" Sasuke
asked in an agitated voice.</p><P>"Seriously if they
don't show up I swear I'll beat them up," Sakura said as she
started to crack her knuckles.</p><P>"Oh hey guys sorry
I'm late I was just talking with Shino and Tenten about how they
were doing," Naruto said as he appeared above the two landing in
front of them.</p><P>"Gah what took you so
long?" Sakura asked as she moved in to punch Naruto.</p><P>"A new project,"
Naruto said as he sat down.</p><P>"What is this new
project?" Sasuke asked.</p><P>"Something you don't
need to worry about," Kyuubi replied as she appeared next to
Naruto.</p><P>"Nani!?!?" Sasuke
and Sakura yelled out but stopped because Kakashi showed up.</p><P>"Where have you been?
Sakura yelled in a voice that looked as if she was going to bite off
his head.</p><P>"Well there was this
old lady…" Kakashi began only to be cut off by Sakura screaming
liar.</p><P>"So what are we doing
today?" Naruto asked as he relaxed some more.</p><P>"We're doing some
d-rank missions as genins," Kakashi said as he led them to a
building to start missions.</p><P>2 hours later. "This
is so boring," Sakura yelled as she pulled out another weed.</p><P>"…" Naruto and
Sasuke remained silent through the whole mission.</p><P>"After this we have a
mission of catching Tora the cat so good luck," Kakashi said with a
smirk before he vanished.</p><P>"So catching a cat is
our mission how hard can it be?" Sakura asked.</p><P>3 hours later. "I
want to freaking kill that cat," Sakura yelled as she chased after
it.</p><P>"Kill," Naruto said
silently while Kyuubi made her fangs and claws a bit longer in her
fox form.</p><P>"Must kill," Sasuke
said as he looked at the cat in front of him.</p><P>"Now, now kids if you
kill the cat it's mission failure which you guys don't want,"
Kakashi said as he appeared behind the genin before catching the cat
which lept into his arms.</p><P>'Did he plan this or
something,' all three thought as they saw the cat now in Kakashi's
arm resting.</p><P>"Well you guys have
the day off now so spend it wisely," Kakashi said as he vanished.</p><P>"Time to go meet
Shino and Tenten," Naruto said as he jumped away leaving Sakura and
Sasuke.</p><P>"Hey Sasuke…"
Sakura began.</p><P>"No," Sasuke said
as he walked away</p><P>"Damn," Sakura said
as she too walked her own way.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So Shino how is your
team?" Naruto asked as he started his 2nd bowl or ramen.</p><P>"Ok… my teammates
don't bother me and don't question me at all," Shino replied as
he sat next to Naruto.</p><P>"That's good… at
least you have normal peers," Tenten said as she thought back to
her current teacher and pupil.</p><P>"At least you have a
team that can cooperate… my team is zero teamwork and it's
starting to get annoying… especially with Tora," Naruto said as
he remembered the even a few minutes ago.</p><P>"Ahh Tora… how I
just want to kill that cat," Tenten said as she absent mindedly
sharpened a kunai.</p><P>"Do I have to fear a
cat?" Shino asked.</p><P>"Yes," was the
consecutive replies from Naruto and Tenten.</p><P>"So have you worked
on anything new these days?" Tenten asked.</p><P>"Yeah plenty… I
even met a new guardian, although I haven't seen what he can do
with me though," Naruto said as he pulled out a green crystal.</p><P>"I see… just
wondering can you make me another weapon?" Tenten asked in a puppy
dog stare.</p><P>"No way am I letting
him. He's been working his ass off these days," Kyuubi said as
she appeared in her human form and hugged Naruto.</p><P>"Aw why?" Tenten
asked in a pouting voice.</p><P>"I just told you
why," Kyuubi responded getting agitated a bit.</p><P>"Fine," Tentensaid
as she crossed her arms over her chest.</p><P>"Oh well… I better
get some rest if I'm going to get ready for my team tomorrow,"
Tenten said as she left.</p><P>"Me too… I need to
sleep also," Shino said as he too left.</p><P>"Time to make our
exit," Naruto said as he vanished in a gust of wind.</p><P>"So he's perfected
his wind manipulation to that degree… amazing," Kyuubi said as
she went after Naruto.</p><P>"They did it again,"
Teuchi said as he brought out a notebook and started counting.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"I wonder when we'll
have a break so I can visit them," Naruto said as he sat on the
Hokage's monument.</p><P>"It'll appear soon…
after all we've been here for more then one year so I think we'll
get a break soon," Kyuubi said as she appeared next to Naruto.</p><P>"Hope it's soon
Kyu-chan," Naruto said.</p><P>"It would be nice to
have a break Naru-kun," Kyuubi said grabbing Naruto's hand. "You
need to get some rest right now so lets go," Kyuubi said as both
disappeared.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So can we have a
better mission then d-rank missions?" Naruto asked getting agitated
by all the d-rank missions they've been doing.</p><P>"Naruto… we have a
system set up so that missions are given appropriate to the level,"
Iruka began.</p><P>"Don't worry I'm
pretty sure they can take it," Hokage said as he pulled out a
scroll, "Your mission will be a c-rank one and is to escort mister
Tazuna to his home in Wave country," Hokage said as Tazuna came in.</p><P>"Are these the kids
that are going to escort me? Just great… just a bunch of no name
kids," Tazuna said making Sasuke flinch.</p><P>"Don't worry I'll
be going as well so there's no need to worry," Kakashi said
making Tazuna feel better.</p><P>"Oh well… at least
it's better then a d-rank mission," Naruto said.</p><P>"True," Kyuubi
finished.</p><P>"Alright team meet in
front of the North gates tomorrow so we can start the mission,"
Kakashi said before he disappeared.</p><P>"Time to pack,"
Naruto said as he left the building.</p><P>"First c-rank mission

Naruto or Summon night swordcraft story 2 or the moves from Final
fantasy 3(from jap) but I do own the moves that I make up.</p><P>"Maybe I shouldn't
have gone away on a C-rank mission I don't have a forge anywhere,"
Naruto started to complain as he followed his team down the road.</p><P>'You and your forge…
seriously you're as bad as Edgar,' Kyuubi thought to Naruto while
in her fox form.</p><P>"Quiet Naruto! We
actually get to go out of the village and I'm not making you screw
this mission up," Sakura said in a officious manner.</p><P>"Sure thing…"
Naruto said as he continued walking.</p><P>"… where's that
girl dope?" Sasuke asked breaking the silence.</p><P>"Huh you mean
Kyu-chan? She's around," Naruto said making Kyuubi lift her head
a bit from Naruto's shoulder.</p><P>"Oh…" Sasuke said
returning back to his previous state.</p><P>"Why do you want to
know that Sasuke-Kun?" Sakura asked trying to win Sasuke's favor.</p><P>"Nothing," Sasuke
said.</p><P>"I see…" Kakashi
said silently as he read his book.</p><P>"So we'll get there
soon right?" Tazuna asked a bit nervous.</p><P>"We'll get you
there safe and sound so you have nothing to worry about," Kakashi
said as he turned to the next page in his book.</p><P>"I hope so," Tazuna
said as he walked a bit closer to the ninja's.</p><P>'Suspicious,'
Naruto thought to Kyuubi.</p><P>'Definitely,'
Kyuubi thought back to Naruto as she yawned.</p><P>'I guess we'll have
some action after all,' Naruto thought as he put his hands in his
pockets.</p><P>'Another new weapon
huh?' Kyuubi thought before her eyes turned to a puddle.</p><P>"Here they come,"
Naruto said out loud catching everyone's attention except
Kakashi's. As soon as Naruto had finished saying that 2 ninja's
burst out of the puddle and soon had Kakashi in chains.</p><P>"One down," the two
said before Kakashi was ripped into shreds in front of them. From
seeing the sight Tazuna froze where he was while Sakura started to
whimper.</p><P>"Two down," the
ninja's began to say as they went after Tazuna.</p><P>"You're right,"
Naruto said as he appeared above one the ninja's. "You two are
going down," Naruto said as he brought his fist down hard knocking
one of the ninja's out.</p><P>"What?!?" the 2nd
ninja said only to be soon hit on the head by Sasuke, effectively
knocking him out.</p><P>"That was a bit
disappointing," Naruto said as he looked at his hand. "At least
this glove is useful," Naruto said looking at the bit of blood that
was on his new gloves. They both were emerald green fingerless
gloves, and had a green crystal lodged in the middle of the glove.</p><P>"Dope what is that?"
Sasuke asked looking at Naruto's gloves.</p><P>"Something I made for
fun," Naruto said as he put his hands in his pockets before he took
them out with no gloves on.</p><P>'No special ability
this time?' Kyuubi thought to Naruto.</p><P>'You'll see… if
it works,' Naruto thought back before turning his attention to
Kakashi who appeared.</p><P>"You did well team,"
Kakashi said as if nothing had happened.</p><P>"Kawarimi," Naruto
said as he looked at the pieces of logs where Kakashi originally was.</p><P>"You were testing
us," Sasuke said looking at Kakashi.</p><P>"Yes and I was also
searching for their target who seems to be in front of us," Kakashi
said as he looked straight at Tazuna.</p><P>"W-what are you
talking about?" Tazuna asked in a nervous voice.</p><P>"What he means is
that those ninja's only came after you… now that is highly
unlikely especially in a C-rank mission," Naruto finished Kakashi's
thought.</p><P>"… with the penury
fee's Wave country has right now we could only hire out ninja's
in a C-rank mission," Tazuna began. "It is all because of Gatou
and his men that Wave country is in the condition it is in right now…
if only we could build a bridge then could we revitalize Wave
country," Tazuna said with a guilty look on his face.</p><P>"So you hired us to
transport you there in case ninja's attack like these two did,"
Naruto said as he pointed at the two demon brothers.</p><P>"I'm sorry but
we're going to have to turn back then," Kakashi said immediately
grabbing everyone's attention.</p><P>"But why?" Sasuke
asked.</p><P>"Because this mission
has gone up to at least a B-rank mission and you guys aren't ready
for this," Kakashi replied.</p><P>"B-but what about
Wave country? My bridge?" Tazuna asked in a frantic voice.</p><P>"Let's just do this
mission… after all on this mission you might get to see our real
skills," Naruto said as he started cracking his knuckles.</p><P>"I agree… I can't
stand any more D-rank mission especially with Tora," Sasuke said
standing confidently.</p><P>"I'm in too,"
Sakura said only because Sasuke wanted to go.</p><P>"Very well… we
shall go on this mission… but leave the jounin nin to me if we ever
meet them," Kakashi said in a deadpan voice.</p><P>"Fine," Naruto said
in an unfazed voice.</p><P>"…sure," everyone
else said a bit shaky.</p><P>"Well let us go
then," Kakashi said in a light manner giving everyone sweat drops
on the back of their heads.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>'This has gotten
interesting,' Kyuubi thought to Naruto as they walked further
ahead.</p><P>'Yeah I know…
finally a way to meet some stronger ninjas,' Naruto thought back as
he looked around. 'Seems like we have company again… this one
feels stronger though,' Naruto thought to Kyuubi who tensed up a
bit.</p><P>'Feels strong,'
Kyuubi thought back before jumping off Naruto's shoulder.</p><P>"Hey when was that
fox there?" Sakura asked grabbing everyone's attention.</p><P>"She's been there
for quite some time if you haven't noticed… she just is a bit
agitated right now that's why she showed herself," Naruto said as
Kyuubi began to pace back and forth.</p><P>"I see," Kakashi
said as he put away his book.</p><P>"What's there to
get worked up about?" Sakura asked.</p><P>"That," Naruto said
as he pointed at a huge sword coming there way.</p><P>"GET DOWN!" Kakashi
shouted getting everybody to crouch down onto the floor.</p><P>"Nice sword,"
Naruto said as he jumped up and kicked the sword down stopping it's
flight.</p><P>"Hmph a skilled genin
I see," A voice said before someone appeared in the tree a few
meters away from them.</p><P>"You could say that…
although right now I'm more interested in this sword. Who made it?
It looks quite durable and strong when I look at it," Naruto said
as he lifted the huge zanbato with one hand.</p><P>"That you won't
need to know," Zabuza said as he jumped down and rushed at Naruto.</p><P>"Naruto get back,"
Kakashi shouted as he rushed forward with a kunai to meet Zabuza's
charge.</p><P>"I wonder what this
is made out of," Naruto said as he walked back to the group while
inspecting the blade.</p><P>"Brat give me back my
blade!!!" Zabuza shouted as he jumped above Kakashi only to get
stabbed in the knee.</p><P>"Don't move Zabuza
or else I'll deal the finishing blow," Kakashi said as he placed
his kunai by Zabuza's throat.</p><P>"As if," Zabuza
said as he grabbed Kakashi's arm before attempting to throw him
over his shoulder.</p><P>"Not a wise idea
Zabuza," Kakashi said as he threw the kunai in his hand which
struck Zabuza in the chest.</p><P>"Crap," Zabuza said
as he clutched his chest. "That is what I would say if it was me,"
Zabuza said before turning into a puddle of water.</p><P>"Mizu Bunshin,"
Kakashi said as his eyes widened in fear when he saw Zabuza behind
his group.</p><P>"I shall take back my
sword," Zabuza said as he reached over to grab Naruto while
releasing killer intent.</p><P>"C-can't move why?"
Sasuke asked as Zabuza towered over him.</p><P>'Even with my
training I'm affected by his killer intent… I guess I have ways
to go before I can challenge a jounin,' Naruto thought as he forced
himself to jump backwards.</p><P>"If you want it so
much then take it," Naruto said as he raised the blade above his
head. "<U>Lightning Enchant,"</U> Naruto shouted making the sword
become surrounded by a few electric sparks. What most people didn't
notice was Kyuubi that was on the ground glowing for a few seconds.</p><P>"Now," Naruto
shouted as he threw the blade at Zabuza.</p><P>"Now that's
something new… almost like Raiga's Technique(is that the guys
name?)," Zabuza said before he jumped back to avoid the throw.</p><P>"Opening," Kakashi
shouted as he rushed up to Zabuza giving a kick straight at the
chest.</p><P>"Too bad," Zabuza
said before he turned into water.</p><P>"Damn another Mizu
bunshin," Kakashi said before he turned his attention to the lake.</p><P>"I see you have one
good student Copy cat Kakashi," Zabuza said as he went through a
flurry of seals.</p><P>"Well you've only
seen the skill of one student I'm pretty sure you'll soon see the
rest," Kakashi said as he ran forward to meet Zabuza.</p><P>"How well can you
fight in the mist? <U>Kirgakure no Jutsu</U>," Zabuza shouted
before a heavy mist surrounded the battle field.</p><P>"Crap not good,"
Kakashi said under his breath as he got into a defensive stance,
waiting.</p><P>'Should we help?'
Naruto thought to Kyuubi as he took a defensive stance around Tazuna.</p><P>'Leave it to Kakashi
for a while… after all there is another guest that is waiting,'
Kyuubi thought as she looked over to a nearby tree.</p><P>'Did that Fox just
look at me?' the person in the tree thought as she soon dismissed
it as a coincidence.</p><P>"This aura I can't
seem to think straight… I can't stand it," Sasuke started to
mumble to himself as the killer intent seemed to get to him.</p><P>"Don't worry Sasuke
we have Kakashi over there to protect us… after all a jounin isn't
a jounin for nothing," Naruto said as he suddenly felt Zabuza
behind him.</p><P>"This is payback kid
for stealing my sword," Zabuza said as he started to swing
vertically across.</p><P>"I don't think so,"
Naruto said as he reached to his back and pulled out a shield from
seemingly nowhere.</p><P>"What?" Zabuza
shouted as his slash was negated by Naruto.</p><P>'Although I look ok
that hit did a number on my arm… I can't even feel bits of my arm
now,' Naruto thought as he saw Zabuza get stabbed by Kakashi.</p><P>"This is getting
old," Kakashi said as he saw Zabuza disappear in a puddle of water
again.</p><P>"I agree," Zabuza
said as he appeared behind Kakashi and slashed at him.</p><P>"Close," Kakashi
said as he ran towards the lake before jumping in.</p><P>"Stupid mistake
Kakashi," Zabuza said as he stood above Kakashi. As soon as Zabuza
said that water surrounded Kakashi lifting him out of the water and
trapped in water.</p><P>"Everyone get out of
here he's too strong for you at your current level," Kakashi
yelled trying to get his subordinates out of the area.</p><P>"Baka like I'll
leave you here," Naruto said as he stepped forward.</p><P>"Hmph…" Sasuke
not wanting to be outdone also stepped forward.</p><P>"Sakura you protect
Tazuna while me and Sasuke do something about Kakashi's situation,"
Naruto said as he put his hands in his pockets.</p><P>"You have a plan
dope?" Sasuke asked as he watched Naruto take his hands out of his
pockets with the same gloves on before.</p><P>"Sort of but I'll
need some help I guess," Naruto said as Kyuubi jumped off his
shoulder.</p><P>"I'm in too then,"
Kyuubi said as she turned into her human form shocking everybody
there.</p><P>"I guess they are not
used to seeing me transform," Kyuubi said as she let her fingers
become claws.</p><P>"Let's go,"
Naruto shouted as he started running towards Zabuza</p><P>"Let's see how you
handle my clones," Zabuza said as 10 mizu bunshins appeared in
front of him.</p><P>"<U>Blitz: Air
Blade,</U>" Naruto shouted shooting out blades of wind destroying 3
of the 10 mizu bunshins.</p><P>"Hmph…" Sasuke
let out a jealous sound as he defended himself against 2 bunshins.</p><P>"What a weakling,"
Kyuubi said as she ran past Sasuke instantly dispelling the 2
bunshins.</p><P>"Kyuubi the rest are
yours," Naruto said as he jumped up into the air before jumping in
mid air towards Zabuza.</p><P>"What an amazing
kid," Zabuza said as he readied to defend himself.</p><P>"Time to test these
gloves out," Naruto shouted as the crystals in the middle of the
gloves started to glow. "<U>Quick charge: Emerald Dragon,</U>"
Naruto shouted as a dragon in a green color came out of one of the
gloves.</p><P>"Don't know what it
is and not going to find out," Zabuza said as he jumped up to dodge
emerald dragon.</p><P>"Too much chakra,
shouldn't have used it too quickly," Naruto said before he went
on one knee. "Kakashi you should be able to finish him," Naruto
said before he lied down.</p><P>"Baka," Kyuubi said
as she pulled Naruto away to watch Kakashi take care of Zabuza. (Too
lazy to write the fight sequence skip to Haku part)</p><P>"You were right he is
dead," the hunter nin said as she walked up to Zabuza.</p><P>"You know you
could've helped us out right?" Kyuubi asked making the hunter
nin.</p><P>"I don't know what
you are talking about," the girl said in a slightly lighter shocked
tone that was only heard by Naruto and Kyuubi.</p><P>"All right jut be
sure to do your job," Kyuubi said as she saw the female hunter nin
disappear.</p><P>'Oh well… I'm
pretty sure I'll have a fun match soon,' Naruto thought to Kyuubi
as he stood up weakly.</p><P>'Ok what the hell did
you do right there?' Kyuubi thought to Naruto as they transported
Kakashi to Tazuna's house.</p><P>'Well… that's one
of the few abilities on this glove… the materials I just found
around the house. The crystals in the center are what they are made
of. Seems like it has some connection with the dragons which I find
amazing,' Naruto began thinking.</p><P>'Dragons huh? The
person that used to live there must have been a genius or something,'
Kyuubi thought back to Naruto.</p><P>'Well as I was
thinking I can quick charge the gloves with chakra which forcibly
takes chakra out of my system at an alarming rate to use an attack.
Or I can use a normal charge that slowly takes my chakra during
battle but stops if I'm in a critical zone,'</p><P>'Must take up a lot
of chakra to get you to almost faint from chakra loss,' Kyuubi
thought to Naruto as they walked side by side.</p><P>'Yeah… but once I
get used to strain I might get stronger then most High level Chunnin…
although most high level chunnin are jounins,'</p><P>'Do you even take
care of all the other weapons you make with the new weapons you keep
on inventing?' Kyuubi thought as they saw the house in view.</p><P>'Every single one of
them I kept in mint condition,' Naruto thought back as he saw
something on his glove. 'Crap there's a blood stain on my glove…
this I don't think I can take off NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!'
Naruto began mentally shouting while his expression showed despair.</p><P>'…you were saying,'
Kyuubi thought as they entered the house.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Ok team first thing
I want to say is that Zabuza is still alive but not in battle shape.
He was wounded as much as I was so that should give us at least 1
week to train which I plan to do for you three," Kakashi said while
lying down.</p><P>"Sure," Naruto said
in a passive voice.</p><P>"…" Sasuke
remained quiet.</p><P>"What can you teach
us in your current state?" Sakura asked almost in a demeaning
fashion.</p><P>"Don't worry about
that just think of the mission for now and protect Tazuna," Kakashi
said before falling asleep.</p><P>"Kyu-chan let's
go," Naruto said standing next to Kyuubi.</p><P>"Sure Naru-kun we
haven't had time these days have we," Kyuubi said while grabbing
his arm.</p><P>"Just don't be too
rough ok," Naruto said.</p><P>"Don't worry you'll
be worked the same way as usual… and maybe have something extra,"
Kyuubi said in a suggestive way.</p><P>"GAH STOP TALKING
ABOUT INDECENT STUFF NEAR US," Sakura screamed out while her face
was beet red.</p><P>"…Dope," Sasuke
said while his face was tinted red a bit also.</p><P>"What do you suppose
they thought we were talking about?" Naruto asked as the two went
out.</p><P>"Beets me," Kyuubi
said as the two of them went out into the forest.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Come on Naru-kun you
almost had it that time… just exert a bit more and you'll be able
to cover your whole body," Kyuubi said as she monitored Naruto's
elemental training.</p><P>"Gah this is too
crazy," Naruto shouted as he bent over, exhausted from chakra
overuse.</p><P>"You'll never be
able to master fire this way… after all fire is one of the closest
things that a craftknight gets to so I think you should be able to do
this," Kyuubi said half encouraging and half insulting Naruto.</p><P>"One more time,"
Naruto shouted as he started to concentrate chakra all over his body.
Slowly part by part his body lit on fire until his head was the only
part not covered.</p><P>"You're almost
there Naru-kun you can do it," Kyuubi began shouting in a
cheerleader like way.</p><P>"Just a bit more,"
Naruto concentrated even harder until his whole body was engulfed in
flames. "I did it," As soon as Naruto had said that the flames
died down and Naruto passed out.</p><P>"You did good
Naru-kun," Kyuubi said before she took Naruto back to Tazuna's
house.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"So what are we
learning today?" Sakura asked as the team walked into the forest.</p><P>"Tree walking,"
Kakashi said simply which made Sakura fall down and Sasuke sweat
drop.</p><P>"Sensei can I go and
do my own training for now since I know which training method you are
talking about and I completed it," Naruto said walking away.</p><P>"I see… well then
go on and do your other exercise," Kakashi said as he used a
shooing motion to get Naruto away.</p><P>"Sensei why does
Naruto get to not do the training while we do? After all everyone
learns how to climb a tree when in the academy," Sakura said.</p><P>"Yes that's true
but Naruto demonstrated to me yesterday that he is more advanced then
he should be right now. So I'm going to train you to climb trees
like this," Kakashi said as he walked up the tree on his crutch.</p><P>"How did you do
that?" Sakura asked in an amazed voice.</p><P>"Using Chakra…
that's all I'm going to say to you guys now. Now I want you guys
to climb up any of these trees until you can reach the top or have
decent control," Kakashi said as he came back down and watched the
two practice.</p><P>'If I'm right I
think I saw Sensei with some kind of dragon techniques like the one
Naruto used before,' Kakashi mused as he saw how Sakura was doing
good and Sasuke wasn't. 'Ah well that comes later must read book
now,' Kakashi thought as he opened up his orange book and started
reading.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"If you can hold the
fire around you for at least 10 minutes then I say at your current
chakra level you mastered your fire element," Kyuubi said as she
watched Naruto struggle to keep his aura around him.</p><P>"This is torture,"
Naruto said as he slowly felt himself get weaker and weaker.</p><P>"Well you're almost
there Naru-kun… once you're able to control and hold the fire
this long you'll probably be able to do most fire jutsu easier and
control fire to a certain extent as well," Kyuubi said as she
watched Naruto's flame get smaller.</p><P>"Well if you give up
now you'll never be able to beat Edgar, Oran, or Master Blaire,"
Kyuubi said out loud.</p><P>"KUSO!!" Naruto
shouted making the flames around him more intense.</p><P>"Maybe I shouldn't
have done that," Kyuubi said quietly as the are around them started
to get burned a bit. '10 minutes I should stop him,' Kyuubi
thought as she concentrated chakra above Naruto. "Cool down
Naruto," Kyuubi said as gallons of water started to fall down on
Naruto.</p><P>"Gah can't move too
sore," Naruto said as he fell backwards unable to move.</p><P>"I guess that should
be like that after all he did use most of his chakra in 3 hours of
practicing…" Kyuubi said as she went up to him. "Well I guess
it couldn't hurt to take a nap," Kyuubi said as she picked up
Naruto and put him in a better scenery, "Although this place is
much better," Kyuubi said before she gently lied Naruto down before
she too lied down snuggling her back against Naruto's chest.</p><P>"Good night
Kyu-chan," Naruto said weakly before losing consciousness.</p><P>"You too Naru-kun,"
Kyuubi said as she too fell asleep.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"That was a nice
sleep," Kyuubi said as she woke up around nature. "It's so nice
to sleep in such a peaceful forest. Oh well I think I'll go walk
for a bit before I wake up Naru-kun," Kyuubi said before she left
Naruto to go exploring.</p><P>As soon as she left
though a girl in a pink kimono walked into the closure Naruto was in
to see him sleeping.</p><P>'He's the one that
Zabuza wants,' Haku thought as she inched closer to Naruto. 'What's
so special about him? I saw him battle and I know I can match him so
why would Zabuza-sama want a kid like him?' Haku thought some more
as she saw Naruto move a bit before waking up.</p><P>"That was a good
sleep," Naruto said as he stretched. "Now where am I?" Naruto
asked no one in particular as he looked around.</p><P>"Ano… you're in
the middle of a forest near a lake," Haku said grabbing Naruto's
attention.</p><P>"Oh so I am… now
how did I get here?" Naruto once again asked no one in particular
as he slowly tried to stand up only to fall back down again. "I
guess I'm not 100 healed yet," Naruto said as he still felt sore
all over his body.</p><P>"Why would you not be
100 healed? Did you have a battle with someone?" Haku asked trying
to get info out of him.</p><P>"Well I was doing
something with Fire manipulation… but I think I over exerted myself
causing serious pain," Naruto said as he tried to move his body
once again only to feel sore.</p><P>"Let me check the
area's you are sore in," Haku said as she moved over to Naruto.</p><P>"Huh why?" Naruto
asked as Haku came over until she was sitting next to Naruto.</p><P>"I think this will
help," Haku said as Naruto felt his body cool down alleviating the
pain a bit.</p><P>"Whatever you did
thanks because I feel a bit better now… I think I can actually move
now," Naruto said as he started to move his arms in circles slowly.
"Much better," Naruto said as he stood up and stretched a bit.</p><P>"I don't think you
should move around too much or else…" Haku began only to hear
Naruto scream.</p><P>"It hurts again,"
Naruto said as he fell onto his back.</p><P>Sigh 'Why does
Zabuza-sama want someone this useless to become one of his tools? I
just don't understand it,' Haku thought as she saw the foolish
antics of Naruto.</p><P>"I just alleviated
the pain not heal it… I'm not that skilled to heal," Haku said
as she looked into her basket.</p><P>"Oh are you getting
something to heal someone?" Naruto asked as he sat up.</p><P>"Yes… it's for
someone very special to me," Haku said in a warm tone.</p><P>"I see… then I'll
help you," Naruto said as he struggled to stand up.</p><P>"You really
shouldn't," Haku said as she started to get worried.</p><P>"Don't ya worry. If
I don't exert by body to the limit then I won't get better.
Besides I've felt worse before," Naruto said as he stood up and
looked around. "So what are the herbs you are looking for,"
Naruto asked.</p><P>"They look like
this," Haku said as she picked up one and showed it to Naruto
before putting it back into the basket.</p><P>"I see," Naruto
said as he stood up and picked the herbs.</p><P>"There were some more
herbs over in that area but the area over there seems to be burned by
some kind of chakra exercise. Do you know who did it?" Haku asked
as she picked some more herbs.</p><P>"N-NO," Naruto said
in a loud voice trying to hide his lie.</p><P>"Really ok," Haku
said not believing a word Naruto had said.</p><P>20 minutes later.</p><P>"I think this is
enough to heal him now," Haku said as she picked up the basket and
stood up.</p><P>"Ok that's good I
hope he'll get better," Naruto said as he stood up also.</p><P>"He will most likely
with me caring for him," Haku said as she turned to leave.</p><P>"Oh when you go back
can you tell Zabuza I want to know what material his Zanbato is made
of," Naruto said making Haku freeze in her tracks.</p><P>"W-what did you say?"
Haku asked a bit shocked.</p><P>"Just say hi to
Zabuza for me all right Hunter nin?" Naruto asked as he turned to
leave.</p><P>'So he isn't that
hopeless after all,' Haku thought as she quickly went back to where
Zabuza was.</p><P>"Man the sores are
still sore," Naruto said as he walked a bit towards the lake.</p><P>"They should be after
all you did over exert yourself," Naruto heard Kyuubi say before
she appeared behind him.</p><P>"Where were you all
this time?" Naruto asked as he turned to see Kyuubi.</p><P>"I've been around
looking at stuff," Kyuubi said as she grabbed onto Naruto's arm.
"Anyway can you explain to me why you smell of a certain girl?"
Kyuubi asked her eyes turning a darker shade of red.</p><P>"Uh heh heh… you
know it's quite a story you see…" Naruto began.</p><P>"No mercy," Kyuubi
said as she was about to hit Naruto only for him to slip out of her
grasp and start running as if death was on his tail.</p><P>"You won't escape
from me NA-RU-TO," Kyuubi shouted as she shot fire balls at Naruto
while chasing him.</p><P>"This is a
misunderstanding," Naruto shouted as he ran back to Tazuna's
house.</p><P>Somewhere else.</p><P>"I see so you met him
in the forest correct?" Zabuza asked Haku.</p><P>"Yes sir… he also
knew who I was the whole time but hid it from me," Haku said
showing now emotion.</p><P>"I see… to even
fool you I want him as my tool even more now," Zabuza said as he
tried to sit up in bed.</p><P>"You shouldn't over
exert yourself Zabuza-sama," Haku said as she let Zabuza lie down
again.</p><P>"A few more days and
we'll meet their team and fight. By that time I want you to be able
to disable him so he can't move until we are done, understood?"
Zabuza asked.</p><P>"Hai," Haku said
obediently.</p><P>A/N: I am so bored
these days… I don't know what to do. Well any way heres the 5th
chapter and I have a few things to say. 1 I wonder why this story is
getting so much reviews and alerts then my other stories. 2. why
don't people just review after they read the story? 3. I'm just
bored so I forgot number 3.</p><P>Well for the voting
lets just say Naruto and Kyuubi are in the lead for now. I'm too
lazy to tally up the points.</p><P>Weapons</p><P>2:
Tenten weapon Spear 4 Bo-staff 5 Swallow 3 Scythe 5</p><P>3: Shino's

Naruto or Summon night swordcraft story 2 or the moves from Final
fantasy 3(from jap) but I do own the moves that I make up.</p><P>"So we'll be
fighting tomorrow won't we?" Naruto asked as he sat on the roof
of Tazuna's house.</p><P>"Seems like it,"
Kyuubi said as she sat next to Naruto. "You know you didn't have
to be that mean to Inari," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"Well… it's just
that someone that acts that pathetic shouldn't even talk about such
things… after all tou-san was taken from me and Edgar just because
we didn't escape in time," Naruto said as he stared up at the
moon.</p><P>"Still… he's just
a little kid… you and Edgar acted like that at first when your
tou-san was taken from you," Kyuubi said trying to defend Inari a
bit.</p><P>"We had an excuse…
it was because of us that he died and I still regret it," Naruto
said as he clutched his chest. "The summonite in my body and my
brother's is one way to remember tou-san," Naruto said as he
clutched his chest tighter.</p><P>"Let's stop
thinking of the past right now… after what's done is done. Right
now we need to concentrate on what we're going to do at the fight
tomorrow which is sure to occur," Kyuubi said as she pulled Naruto
up.</p><P>"True… I need to
ask Zabuza what his sword is made of. It was quite interesting how it
conducted magic easily," Naruto said as he went back inside.</p><P>"Too quick," Kyuubi
said as she followed Naruto downstairs.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Meanwhile.</p><P>"Haku prepare to
strike the bridge tomorrow," Zabuza said as he started to flex his
arms.</p><P>"Hai… are really
going to make that boy one of your tools?" Haku asked.</p><P>"I told you before
that he is useful so we'll be using him as a tool just like you,"
Zabuza said as he lied back down.</p><P>"I see… after all
you only need tools after all," Haku said with a deadpan
expression. 'Something tells me my fight won't be too easy,'
Haku thought as she exited the room.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Yo Edgar what are
you doing out here tonight?" Dinah asked as she saw Edgar by the
ruins of his old house.</p><P>"I was just thinking
of the past," Edgar replied as he turned to face Dinah.</p><P>"You still worried
about Naruto?" She asked as she stood next to Naruto.</p><P>"I guess you could
say that. We haven't heard from him in a year, which is overdoing
it in my opinion. He could have at least come to visit us at least
once," Edgar said as he stared at the moon again.</p><P>"I'm sure he's
just too busy right now," Dinah said as she came up beside Edgar.</p><P>"Wow! I'm amazed
that you're acting nice today," Edgar said in a shocked tone.</p><P>"What do you mean I'm
acting nice? What I meant to say is that Naruto probably forgot about
you and is happily living in…" Dinah began to say only to stop.</p><P>"I'm sorry, I'm
sorry," Dinah began to say before her appearance changed. Instead
of black wings she had white ones and her t-shirt had a heart instead
of a broken one. "She really is worried about your younger brother
also and just can't say it outright. I too am worried something bad
might have happened to Naruto," The girl began to say.</p><P>"I understand… I
just hope he'd come to visit us soon," Edgar said.</p><P>"Gah… I can't
believe I let her take over my body again," Dinah said as she
returned to her normal self. "Although I guess I do miss him a
bit," Dinah said in a small voice.</p><P>"Maybe we should
prepare for his birthday? I think it's soon," Edgar said in a
thoughtful voice.</p><P>"…I can't believe
that you forgot your brother's birthday… I'm not sure which of
you two is worse," Dinah said as she shook her head.</p><P>"… you don't need
to rub it in," Edgar said before he looked up at the moon.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Alright team are we
all ready to go?" Kakashi asked as he sat in the kitchen.</p><P>"We are all up but
Naruto and his girl friend seem to be sleeping," Sakura said not
noticing Sasuke twitch at the mention of the girl friend.</p><P>"I see… well it's
been tough on Naruto even if I don't know what happened to him…
so let's let him sleep in for a bit longer," Kakashi said as he
left the house.</p><P>"…girlfriend,"
Sasuke said under his breath before he left the house.</p><P>"Have a safe trip,"
Tsunami said before she returned to the kitchen.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Sasuke get ready,"
Kakashi said as team 7 missing one member reached the bridge.</p><P>"I know," Sasuke
said as they saw a hazy mist drift in from the uncompleted side of
the bridge.</p><P>"Seems like you're
missing the one member of your team," Zabuza's voice sounded from
the mist before 6 Zabuza's surrounded team 7.</p><P>"If you're talking
of Naruto we let him have a break today especially after what
happened last night," Kakashi said as he got into a better fighting
stance.</p><P>"Why would you want a
dead last dope like him anyway?" Sasuke asked as he took out a
kunai.</p><P>"Only someone as
narrow minded as you will never understand," Zabuza said as he
advanced forward.</p><P>"Hmph as if… that
dope will never be stronger then me," Sasuke said as he moved and
dispelled the 6 water clones.</p><P>"Oh the weak one has
gotten stronger," Zabuza's voice came from the end of the bridge.</p><P>"Hmph… the weak one
is not me but Naruto," Sasuke said as he started to rush towards
Zabuza.</p><P>"Haku take care of
him," Zabuza said not moving an inch.</p><P>"Hai," Haku said as
she rushed quickly to Sasuke before landing a kick on his chin
sending him backwards.</p><P>'Fast,' was what
Sasuke thought as he flipped backwards to land on his feet. "Take
this," Sasuke yelled as he charaged again at Haku.</p><P>"It's useless,"
Haku said as she appeared in front of Sasuke again only this time
with some needles.</p><P>"I don't think so,"
Sasuke replied as he brought out his own kunai to block the needle
stab.</p><P>"I see… but you are
at a disadvantage here," Haku began to explain. "We are
surrounded by water and because of that there is no way you can win,"
Haku said as she started to perform one handed seals. <U>"</U><b><U>Sensatsu
Suishou Hijutsu</U></b><b>,"
Haku shouted as she stamped on the ground. </b></p><P><b>"What?"
Sasuke said as he saw the water around them turn into needles. </b></p><P><b>"You
can not win here," Haku said as the needles converged onto their
location.</b></p><P><b>"Shit,"
Sasuke said as he jumped back in the air. "Take this </b><b><U>Katon:
Goukakyuu no Jutsu</U></b><b>,"
Sasuke shouted as he let out a ball of fire towards Haku. </b></p><P><b>"</b><b><U>Mizu
no Tate,</U></b><b>­"(I
think that's right for shield of water… I'm not Japanese so I
can't find names like that…) Haku shouted causing the water
around her to converge in front of her, nullifying the fire jutsu. </b></p><P><b>"Too
bad your other student isn't here… without him Haku won't have
a challenge," Zabuza said as he finally moved forward. "I guess
I'll have to get my new tool another time… after all mission
comes first," Zabuza said as he rushed forward toward Tazuna.</b></p><P><b>"I
won't let you," Kakashi said as he put his hand on his head band.
"Sharingan," Kakashi shouted as his sharingan came into view.</b></p><P><b>"Oh
ho using your sharingan again I see… no matter I'll win no matter
what, </b><b><U>Kirigakure
no Jutsu</U></b><b>,"
Zabuza said in mid charge while performing the right hand seals.
"This time I won't lose," Zabuza's voice came from within the
mist. </b></p><P><b>"We'll
see about that," Kakashi said as he stood still in his position. </b></p><P><b>"You
should know of my technique Kakashi. Last time you were in it I was a
bit too rash so I messed up. But this time," Zabuza said as he
appeared behind Kakashi.</b></p><P><b>"Shit,"
Kakahsi said as he dodged just in time. </b></p><P><b>"I'll
take my time," Zabuza said as he disappeared in the mist again.</b></p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Gah I overslept,"
Naruto shouted as he literally jumped out of the bed he was in.</p><P>"Huh… what's so
loud in the morning?" Kyuubi asked as she got out of the same bed
Naruto was in.</p><P>"We overslept,"
Naruto yelled unfazed by Kyuubi in a loose night robe beside him.</p><P>"What?!?! I can't
believe that and the team just left us," Kyuubi said as she started
to get dressed in other clothing.</p><P>"Gack why are you
changing in here!?!?" Naruto asked as a trickle of blood came out
of his nose.</p><P>"Well… since we are
like boyfriend girlfriend and we've been together for such a long
time I don't really mind… after all I've seen you in the bath
plenty of more times then you've seen me naked," Kyuubi said as
she continued to dress leaving a shocked Naruto.</p><P>"Gah now's not the
time to stall must get dressed and get info out of Zabuza," Naruto
said as he quickly changed into a new set of clothes before rushing
out.</p><P>"Stop," Kyuubi said
silently as she stopped Naruto from exiting the house by grabbing his
scarf effectively choking him a bit.</p><P>"Can't breathe,"
Naruto began to say only to be ignored by Kyuubi.</p><P>"Something's going
on outside and it doesn't look too good," Kyuubi said as fox ears
appeared on top of her head and started to twitch in subtle
movements.</p><P>"Hey you're right…
you ready Kyu?" Naruto asked in a serious voice.</p><P>"I'm always ready,"
Kyuubi said as her claws extended and her face became a bit more
feral.</p><P>Meanwhile outside.</p><P>"Let my mom go!"
Inari shouted as he began to run towards the 2 henchmen.</p><P>"Time for some
blood," one of the two henchmen said as he raised his katana to
slash down only to meet another sword.</p><P>"<U>Wind Force,"</U>
Naruto shouted as he pressed his hand against one of the henchmen's
chest. A blast of wind sent the man back effectively knocking him out
while sinking into the water.</p><P>"What the," the 2nd
said only to be silenced by Kyuubi with her claws.</p><P>"That should do it,"
Naruto said as he put Soul Harmony on his back.</p><P>"Good thing we
overslept or else someone might have been killed," Kyuubi said as
she started to wash her claws in the lake.</p><P>"Inari what you did
there was really brave. I'm pretty sure that your dad is looking at
you with pride right now," Naruto said as he stretched a bit.
"We'll be back," Naruto said as he and Kyuubi disappeared.</p><P>"I can't stand idle
I have to help," Inari said as he started to awaken his mom.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"This is the end for
you. Inside these mirrors nothing has ever gotten out," Haku said
as she continued with the barrage of needles.</p><P>"We'll see about
that," Sasuke said weakly as he tried to desperately dodge the
needles coming his way.</p><P>"Time to end this,"
Haku said in a cold voice as the speed of the needles seemed to
increase causing Sasuke to panic a little.</p><P>'If only my Sharingan
would activate,' Sasuke began to think. 'No I won't die like
this I will live to kill Itachi I have to live,' Sasuke thought as
he closed his eyes before opening them.</p><P>"Too bad that Zabuza
has no need for the Sharingan," Haku said as the needles hit Sasuke
neck immobilizing him.</p><P>"Kuso and I finally
had my strength come to me," Sasuke said in a low tone.</p><P>"The end," Haku
said as she prepared to strike only to stop when she heard something.</p><P>"<U>Fire Enchant</U>,"
both heard a familiar voice say before one of the mirrors broke into
tiny pieces.</p><P>"Looks like I'm not
too late," Naruto said as he entered the dome of mirrors with Soul
Harmony covered in dark red flames.</p><P>"Let me take care of
that hussy," Kyuubi said as she faced Haku. "Nobody steals my
man," Kyuubi said as she rushed at the mirror Haku was in.</p><P>"Fast," Haku said
as she saw Kyuubi come at her. "But in here I'm faster," Haku
said as she disappeared into another mirror.</p><P>"That may be true,
but what happens if I destroy these mirrors?" Kyuubi asked as she
broke the one Haku was recently in.</p><P>"Shit," Haku said
as she started to throw needles at Kyuubi.</p><P>"Not gonna let that
happen," Naruto said as he appeared in front of Kyuubi blocking all
the needles.</p><P>'He is good,' Haku
thought as she escaped from another mirror.</p><P>"You won't last
much longer like that," Kyuubi said as she broke another mirror
leaving only 4 more mirrors.</p><P>"Just don't kill
her Kyu-chan… after all I'm pretty sure our infiltration mission
last night proved that she is not our real target," Naruto said
getting a groan from Kyuubi.</p><P>"I regret going on
that mission with you… now I can't beat up this hussy… much,"
Kyuubi said as she broke another mirror.</p><P>"What do you mean
real target?" Haku asked as she jumped out of her last mirror.</p><P>"You do know that
Gatou is planning on betraying you today on this bridge whether you
complete your mission or not," Naruto said as he stood next to
Kyuubi.</p><P>"Yup that's the way
Gatou planned it… I wished he hadn't," Kyuubi said as she
clenched her claws.</p><P>"But we are still
enemies," Haku said as she got into a defensive stance.</p><P>"At your current
level you won't be able to get both of us serious," both Kyuubi
and Naruto said at the same time as they walked past her.</p><P>"I'll…" Haku
began only to stop when she felt the intense glares from the duo.</p><P>"I need to ask what
Zabuza's sword is made up of now," Naruto said his glare
instantly dissipating.</p><P>"Honestly why must
you do that," Kyuubi said as she chased after Naruto.</p><P>'Those two are on a
totally different level together… it seemed as if both were one
right there,' Haku thought as she went over what happened.</p><P>"Yo Zabuza," Naruto
said as he appeared next to Zabuza in the mist shocking Kakashi and
Zabuza.</p><P>"When did he get
here?" Zabuza shouted as he jumped back further into the mist.</p><P>"Oh I just got here
and finished fighting with Haku," Naruto said as he pointed Soul
Harmony Zabuza's direction. "Now I wonder what's stronger your
zanbato or my Soul Harmony," Naruto said as a torrent of power
started to come out of the sword blowing the mist away.</p><P>"What sheer power,"
Zabuza said as he tried to keep his cool.</p><P>'This power… it
seems like the one from the Kyuubi attack… but that's
impossible,' Kakashi thought as he soon saw red chakra come out of
the blade and surround Naruto.</p><P>"With Kyu-chan by my
side I feel much stronger," Naruto said as Kyuubi stood next to
him.</p><P>"He's easily at a
jounin level right now," Zabuza said as he stared at Naruto.
"Interesting I shall enjoy this," Zabuza said as he lifted his
Zanbato and charged.</p><P>"Kakashi-sensei
please leave this to me," Naruto said as the red chakra fully
engulfed him. "Battle start," Naruto said as he disappeared from
sheer speed.</p><P>"Fast but not to my
eyes," Zabuza said as he raised his Zanbato and slashed down to
meet Naruto's sword.</p><P>"I'm much stronger
then before," Naruto said as he pushed Zabuza back some more.</p><P>"I won't lose in
strength to some petty Genin," Zabuza said as he suddenly pushed
back with more force.</p><P>"As if I will lose,"
Naruto replied as he started to add more force and chakra.</p><P>'This really is
Kyuubi's power! But how?' Kakashi thought as he saw a red chakra
emerge from Naruto.</p><P>"A bit too much
chakra there," Naruto said as most of his chakra with Kyuubi's
lashed out at Zabuza.</p><P>"I have to end this
quickly," Zabuza said as he brought his Zanbato down stronger then
before.</p><P>"You know we don't
have fight to the death," Naruto said as Soul Harmony started to
glow brighter.</p><P>"What do you mean by
that?" Zabuza asked as he attacked again.</p><P>"Gatou was planning
on betraying you the moment you either completed or failed the
mission," Naruto said as he jumped back.</p><P>"I knew I couldn't
trust that pig… oh well… but that doesn't mean I'll knock you
unconscious," Zabuza said as he appeared next to Naruto and
delivered a slash which Naruto blocked.</p><P>"I guess this is
where I step in," Kakashi said as he took out a scroll and started
to do some seals before slamming the scroll onto the ground. (forgot
the name of the technique)</p><P>"Damn what are these
dogs?" Zabuza said as he was immobilized by Kakashi's summons.</p><P>"They'll keep on
holding onto you and won't let go so I suggest you stop trying,"
Kakashi said as he looked around. "And here we have company,"
Kakashi said as he pointed at the end of the bridge. There stood
Gatou and some men which all looked ready for blood shed.</p><P>"So I see you and
your pet tool lost Zabuza," Gatou said as he held his crane. "Too
bad I don't have any use for you anymore so now you die," Gatou
said as the army of mercenaries behind him grunted in agreement.</p><P>"He won't be dieing
today because we're here," Naruto said as he stepped forward.</p><P>"Let me do all the
work," Kyuubi said as she stepped forward.</p><P>"Fine… just don't
kill… too much," Naruto said only to see Kyuubi put on a feral
face.</p><P>"I'm not sure if
I'll agree to that," Kyuubi said as she stepped forward before
disappearing.</p><P>"I hope she doesn't
over do it," Naruto said getting worried looks from everyone else.</p><P>"Where did that girl
go?" Gatou asked as he looked around.</p><P>"Too late," Kyuubi
said as she appeared next to Gatou before slitting his throat.
"Anymore opposers?" Kyuubi asked as she glared at the
mercenaries.</p><P>"You killed our meal
ticket so definitely," one of the brigand members said as he
stepped forward.</p><P>"Damn… this is
going the way Kyuubi want it… time to step in," Naruto said as he
stood up only to stop when he saw an arrow fly overhead.</p><P>"We'll protect this
bridge no matter what," Naruto heard Inari say from the other side
of the bridge with what looked like an army of villagers.</p><P>"Oh ho this works out
fine," Naruto said as he saw the group of mercenaries slowly start
to filter off of the bridge and fall into the water below.</p><P>"Damn no fun there,"
Kyuubi said as she walked back towards Naruto.</p><P>"YEAH WE ARE RID OF
GATOU AND THOSE THUGS!!!" Some villagers started screaming
jubilantly while others sobbed silently in joy.</p><P>"This is truly a
great moment," Tazuna said as he started to sob a bit.</p><P>"It sure is… Naruto
can I speak with you now?" Kakashi asked in a tone that made Naruto
not refuse.</p><P>"I guess… Kyu,"
Naruto said as he followed Kakashi off the bridge with Kyu next to
him.</p><P>"Seems like something
interesting is going on," Zabuza said as he noticed his tool, Haku
come up to him.</p><P>"Zabuza-sama I was no
match for those two… I am sorry I failed you as a tool," Haku
began but was stopped by Zabuza.</p><P>"Well… just don't
mess up next time… as for now I want you to spy on that kid and his
sensei on what they are discussing right now," Zabuza said as he
pointed to where they went.</p><P>"Hai," Haku said as
she created a mirror before disappearing inside of it.</p><P>"Too many secretes
these days," Zabuza said as he sat down trying to ignore the
constant yelling and dancing from the villagers. 'troublesome,'</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Who are you really?"
Kakashi asked Naruto once the two were a fair distance away from the
bridge.</p><P>"What do you mean I'm
Naruto? The same old guy who's on your team," Naruto said as if
it were the most common thing on earth.</p><P>"I know that but…
how do I say this… didn't you just use Kyuubi's Chakra?"
Kakashi asked in a hesitant voice.</p><P>"Oh that's simple
that's because she's standing right next to me," Naruto said as
Kyuubi's eyes turned a darker red.</p><P>"K-K-KKKKKKKKYUUBI!??!?!?!?!?!?"
Kakashi screamed out mainly out of fear then shock. "But she was
sealed in a young boy by my sensei, also the boy disappeared on that
same night. There's no possible way for you to be that boy!"
Kakashi asserted his ideas.</p><P>"Well you have visual
proof that I'm here," Kyuubi said as nine tails appeared behind
her one of them wrapping around Naruto's waist.</p><P>"Don't worry she's
practically harmless," Naruto said only to receive a hard hit on
the head resulting in a bump forming on the top of his head. "Most
of the times," Naruto said as he rubbed the bump.</p><P>"…I guess I'll
get my explanation from Hokage," Kakashi said as he pulled out a
orange book before walking back to the bridge. "As long as you
don't attack anyone from Konoha I have no reason to attack you
back… although I still feel mal about you and sensei," Kakashi
said as he walked back.</p><P>"Do you think I
should have told him about his sensei being your <I>real</I> father?"
Kyuubi asked seeing Naruto move a bit.</p><P>"No… I'm
perfectly fine as being known as a nobody who suddenly appeared,"
Naruto said as he walked again. "Oh and Haku don't try spying on
us it just won't work," Naruto said as he jumped up into the air
before flying away.</p><P>"You stay away from
ok?" Kyuubi asked in more of a demand then a question before
disappearing herself.</p><P>"Those two are
definitely strong and strange," Haku said before she too
disappeared in one of her mirrors.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"I kind of feel sorry
for him now don't you?" Naruto asked Kyuubi as they looked at the
scene in front of them.</p><P>"Well that's what
he gets for acting all cool and attracting girl's like flies,"
Kyuubi said as she snickered at the scene.</p><P>"Save me," Sasuke
said weakly as Sakura was on top of him crying saying he was dead or
something like that.</p><P>"Do you think she'll
realize he's not dead?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"No she knows he's
not dead. She's only pretending so she can stay on him longer,"
Kyuubi said as they watched the helpless struggle of Sasuke against
Sakura.</p><P>"Oni…" Sasuke
said before passing out from lack of breath, thanks to Sakura.</p><P>"Let's go back, I'm
sure Tsunami has a feast waiting or something," Naruto said as he
walked away ignoring Sasuke.</p><P>"Ok," Kyuubi said
as she latched onto Naruto's arm ignoring Sasuke's constant
wailing.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>2 days later</p><P>"Thanks for making us
that meal Tsuami-san it was delicious," Naurto said as team 7 stood
by the other end of the bridge.</p><P>"Oh thank you
Naruto-kun well we had to do the best for Wave countries saviors,"
Tsunami said in a generous tone.</p><P>"Yeah without you
guys Wave could be in a real huge bind right now," Tazuna said in a
jovial tone.</p><P>"You better come back
and visit," Inari said as tears started to form in his eyes.</p><P>"Don't worry I'm
sure both Naruto and I will come and visit," Kyuubi said wiping a
tear from Inari's eye.</p><P>"Yeah we will… that
is if we can get out of Konoha," Naruto said as they went to their
team.</p><P>"It's a promise you
guys will come back right?" Inari asked a bit desperate.</p><P>"Definetly a
craftknight must not break his word after all," Naruto said as they
walked off of the bridge.</p><P>"Now with the part of
naming this bridge what should we call it?" Tazuna asked everyone
who just stood there thinking.</p><P>"I know! What about
the Great Naruto Bridge?" Inari asked getting approval from the
townspeople.</p><P>"Seems like everyone
likes it so it will stay," Tazuna said with a happy grin on his
face.</p><P>"Zabuza-sama what
should we do now?" Haku asked from a nearby tree.</p><P>"Well… for now
we'll continue on doing missions to raise money. Sooner or later
I'll take on the Mizukage himself, but before that we'll get
Naruto to help," Zabuza said as he checked his sword. "I need to
get something like that done to my Zanbato," Zabuza said as he put
his Zanbato on his back.</p><P>"I hope we can meet
again so I can beat them," Haku said as they prepared to leave.</p><P>"Are you sure? I
thought you wanted to meet them again because of the boy Naruto,"
Zabuza said making Haku blush a little.</p><P>"Perhaps," Haku
said before she jumped away.</p><P>"This is getting
complicated," Zabuza said as he too jumped away going after Haku.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Orochimaru-san I
have received word from the Kazekage that he is willing to
participate in the invasion of Konoha," Kabuto said as he walked
into Orochimaru's room.</p><P>"Excellent… now if
only I can summon something better then different colored tanks,"
Orochimaru yelled out the last part as Kabuto saw the room filled
with mainly green tanks but some other colors as well.</p><P>"Maybe you should
take a break for now," Kabuto suggested in a worried tone.</p><P>"No I will summons
something better then what Mizuki summoned before," Orochimaru said
as he started another ritual. "Not another tank," Orochimaru
screamed as he threw the tank to the other side of the room.</p><P>"I don't think you
should've done that," Kabuto said as he saw the other tanks
converge on Orochimaru's location.</p><P>"What harm could
these puny little tanks do?" Orochimaru asked only to receive
severe burns from the blasts.</p><P>"Just be sure to put
away your toys later Orochimaru-sama," Kabuto said as he left the
room with Orochimaru still screaming.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Naruto I think Edgar
and the gang are getting lonely without you," Kyuubi said as they
continued walking.</p><P>"I bet they are…
maybe I can ask the old man if I can go on a vaction?" Naruto asked
as they continued on walking oblivious to the rest of the teammates
listening in on their conversation.</p><P>"Say the word and
we'll go back to our home world," Kyuubi said in a bit of an
excited tone.</p><P>"That won't be much
longer I hope," Naruto said as he looked forward. Everyone else
quickly turned around pretending to act normal.</p><P>"Well let's go team
we have another mission after this… a pretty exciting one also,"
Kakashi said as the team continued their journey to Konoha.</p><P>A/n: Sorry for the late
update but my mom was getting angry and I couldn't go on the
computer. Also there is the problem with finishing Summer homework.
At least my Sat Boot camp is over… althought the best score I got

colledge. Wish me luck and so on. Well a least I'm not bored

on the bridge.</p><P>"Something about
Kakashi wanting to talk to us," Sakura said as she tapped her foot
faster.</p><P>"Well it better be
good since we've been waiting here for over 2 hours," Sasuke said
as he started to get angrier.</p><P>'He better be here or
else I'll seriously do something that will traumatize him,'
Kyuubi thought to Naruto</p><P>"I'm out of here if

here,' Kyuubi thought to Naruto as a poof of smoke appeared on the
top of the bridge.</p><P>"Sorry I'm late I…"
Kakashi began.</p><P>"LIAR!!" Sakura
said before Kakashi could finish.</p><P>"Well anyway I have
one thing to say you guys here are the forms of the Chunnin exam. You
guys don't need to pressure each other for the exam but this will
determine whether you make it to chunnin or not," Kakashi said as
he gave three forms to each of his students. "Well the Chunnin exam
is later today so see ya," Kakashi said as he first stared at
Naruto before disappearing.</p><P>"For him later means
like 4 hours… so that means 4 hours to make a weapon or train,"
Naruto said as he put himself in a thinking position. "4 hours to
make a new weapon!!!!" Naruto shouted as he jumped into the air and
disappeared with Kyuubi on his shoulder.</p><P>"Gah I'll never
understand him," Sakura said as she turned to Sasuke. "Sasuke
will you…" Sakura began to ask only to see Sasuke frantically
jumping away creating some distance. "Unfair…" Sakura said as
she walked back to her house.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"I jumped and
disappeared… now I don't know where I am," Naruto said as he
looked around to find himself in a crowded part of Konoha.</p><P>'This is why you
shouldn't jump without thinking,' Kyuubi thought to Naruto as she
bit his ear.</p><P>"That hurt," Naruto
said silently as he put his hand on Kyuubi's head, 'No biting
next time,' Naruto thought to her as Kyuubi nuzzled into his hand
some more.</p><P>'Watch out for the 3
mini nin's,' Kyuubi thought all of a sudden as her ears picked up
a bit. Sure enough once Naruto had left the crowd of people there was
a square box with 2 holes poked in front of it following him.</p><P>'Can't they think
of something more creative?' Naruto thought to Kyuubi as he picked
up the pace causing the box to pick up pace also. '…' Both
Kyuubi and Naruto thought as they saw the box stop as soon as Naruto
stopped.</p><P>'Should I just scare
them like last time?' Kyuubi thought to Naruto as she started to
get irritated by the box following them.</p><P>'They probably won't
fall for it… although I've been thinking of a prank my self,'
Naruto thought as he pulled out a quarterstaff from his pocket.
'Thank god for sealing,' Naruto said as he started to twirl the
staff above his head.</p><P>'What do you plan on
doing?' Kyuubi thought to Naruto as she watched Naruto turn towards
the box with the staff spinning in his hands.</p><P>"You know… this
quarter staff can break rocks," Naruto said as he stared at the
square box in front of him. "I wonder if I should do this town a
favor and break this abnormal rock," Naruto said as the staff came
dangerously close to the rock.</p><P>"Ahhh quick release
the gun powder," a kids voice said resulting in a huge boom with
colorful smoke coming out from the box.</p><P>"You shouldn't do
that Konohamaru someone might come by and break a rock like I
could've," Naruto said as he put the quarterstaff back into his
pocket. "So what are you doing here Konohamaru, Moegi, Udon?"
Naruto asked as the three kids came out from the smoke.</p><P>"Well when you came
back you said you would help us train in weapons," Konohamaru said
as he took out a pair of trench knives.</p><P>"Yeah we even bought
the weapons you told us to get," Moegi said as she took out a metal
quarterstaff of her own.</p><P>"Why did I get nun
chucks?" Udon asked as he pulled out two black nun chucks.</p><P>"Well… I have the
chunnin exam today so I don't know about teaching you…" Naruto
began to say only to here 3 whining kids.</p><P>"But… but… you
promised," Konohamaru said as he looked up to Naruto.</p><P>"Yeah," Moegi said
as she looked to Naruto.</p><P>"Right," Udon said
as all three looked up and gave him puppy eyes.</p><P>"Gah must resist…
Puppy eyes to strong… must direct it to another source," Naruto
said as his hand slowly moved towards Kyuubi.</p><P>'What are you doing?'
Kyuubi thought as she felt Naruto move his hand.</p><P>"This," Naruto said
as he pulled Kyuubi off his shoulder and put Kyuubi in front of him
letting her take full blast from puppy eyes.</p><P>'Gah… too
powerful…' Kyuubi thought as she tried to look away. 'If only I
could,' Kyuubi thought about Naruto before someone called out his
name breaking the concentration from the puppy eyes.</p><P>"Sakura?" Naruto
asked as he looked at his savior.</p><P>"Yeah Naruto what are
you doing here?" Sakura asked as she saw the three chibi nin's in
front of her, "Playing around with little kids like Inari?"
Sakura asked.</p><P>"Nah… I'm jus
trying to find my way home," Naruto said getting sweat drops from
everyone there.</p><P>"Neh Naruto is this
girl your fan?" Konohamaru asked not realizing the growing killer
intent that caused Sakura's hair to rise up.</p><P>"Run," Naruto said
calmly as he pushed Konohamaru causing him to run also.</p><P>'great a banshee is
chasing us,' Kyuubi said sarcastically as she saw Sakura chasing
both of them.</p><P>"Konohamaru this is
all your fault you know," Naruto said as he ran next to Konohamaru.</p><P>"No it isn't, if
you only had agreed to train us then we wouldn't have gone through
all this," Konohamaru said as he put on a burst of speed.</p><P>"Watch out," Naruto
said as Konohamaru looked forward to see somebody who had on a batman
like hood. "Gah too late," Naruto said as he stopped and covered
his eyes as he saw Konohamaru crash into the man.</p><P>"I'm sorry sir,"
Konohamaru began to say as he rubbed his butt.</p><P>"That hurt you brat,"
the man said as he picked Konohamaru up by his scarf chocking him a
bit.</p><P>"Kankuro just stop,"
the girl next to him said as he saw what was happening.</p><P>"Why should I? I'm
just going to teach this bat what happens to people who hurt me,"
the guy named Kankuro said as eh lifted his hand back in a position
to punch Konohamaru. "Take this brat," the guy said as his fist
went forward to hit Konohamaru only for a staff to block his fist.</p><P>"I think you should
stop," Naruto said as he held his staff with ease which was
blocking Kankuro's punch.</p><P>"You brat," Kankuro
said as he dropped Konohamaru and reached for his back which had a
white mummy wrapped object on it.</p><P>"You're going to
use Kasuru(Forgot the name of the puppet)?" the blond haired girl
asked as she looked at him surprised.</p><P>"Yeah I'm going to
show what happens to people who mess with me," Kankuro said as he
got his <I>thing</I> ready.</p><P>"You should just
stop," Naruto said again as he moved forward and hit both of
Kankuro's hands causing him to drop the white thing.</p><P>"Kankuro stop you'll
make a fool out of yourself if you try to fight against this man,"
a man with a sand gourd said as he stood on a tree.</p><P>"Why are you picking
on a foreign genin Naruto?" Sasuke said as he stood on the tree.
'When did he get here?' Sasuke thought as he saw the man with the
gourd look at the scene.</p><P>"Gaara why are you
here?" Kankuro asked as he looked at Gaara with a scared face.</p><P>"Making sure you
don't get in trouble yourself… just get back to the hotel so we
can prepare for the exam.</p><P>"Hai," Kankuro said
in a shaky voice as he put his thing back n his back.</p><P>"What's your name?"
Gaara asked as he looked at Naruto.</p><P>"Me? I'm just
Naruto," Naruto said as he stared at Gaara's gourd. "Did
Shukaku tell you where he's from? Because I've never heard of you
in the world I've been in," Naruto said getting all three sand
gennin to stop in their tracks.</p><P>"…I'll definitely
fight you in the chunnin exam… mother demands it," Gaara said
getting the confused looks from his and Naruto's teammates.</p><P>"Sure look forward to
it… but isn't Shukaku a guy?" Naruto asked as he turned to
leave.</p><P>"Mother never
specified," Gaara said as he too turned around and walked away.</p><P>"Mother? Shukaku?
Guy?" Sakura asked putting on a confused face.</p><P>"Let's just get
going… we already wasted our time by standing here," Naruto said
as he walked in another direction.</p><P>"Naruto… the
schools the other way," Sakura said causing Naruto and Kyuubi to
face fault.</p><P>"I guess we should
get going," Naruto said as he headed the other way.</p><P>"Let's get going,"
Sasuke said as he followed Naruto. "Sakura you're coming right?"
Sasuke asked.</p><P>"Yeah I am," Sakura
said as she went after her two teammates.</p><P>"Konohamaru and gang
I'll practice with you after the exam if I have time," Naruto
said as they went away</p><P>"That's a promise
Nii-san,"</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Ehh so this is the
testing area?" Naruto asked. "It sure is crowded," Naruto said
as he looked at the 2nd floor which was guarded by some
people.</p><P>"You should not take
the chunnin exam and just go home," a person in front of the door
said.</p><P>"At your current
skills you won't even make it past the first round," the 2nd
one said as they pushed back a familiar green ninja.</p><P>"That's unfair,"
Lee said as he tried to stand up.<p></p><P>"Life's unfair,"
the guy said as he looked a the people in front of him. "If you
guys think you'll ever become chunnin then you should just give
up," the man said as he got ready to defend himself.</p><P>"Just let us pass and
go up the stairs," Sasuke said only for Naruto to cover his mouth.</p><P>"Ahh don't mind him
just continue what you're doing," Naruto said as he pulled Sasuke
up the stairs.</p><P>"…" was the
reaction of most of the crowd as they saw Sasuke get pulled up by
Naruto.</p><P>"Lee… Neji lets go
now," Tenten said in a whisper as they agreed and went off. "Naruto
I see you're here," Tenten said as she walked up to Naruto who
was at the door.</p><P>"Ah Tenten, Neji and
Lee… glad to see you guys will be in the exam," Naruto said as he
walked up to them.</p><P>"Of course we'll be
in this exam my eternal rival," Lee said as he grabbed onto
Naruto's hand creating a sunset.</p><P>'No not this!!!'
Naruto thought as he got hit with a full blast of youthfulness.</p><P>"Lee stop it you're
killing him and kyu," Tenten yelled as she saw Naruto start to turn
white. "Neji do something!" Tenten yelled only to see Neji with
his spirit standing above him.</p><P>"Help me…" Naruto
said as he started to let loose his soul which was coming out of his
mouth.</p><P>"Hurry pull him out,"
Tenten said as she pulled on Naruto to get him out.</p><P>"I'm saved,"
Naruto said as his soul flew back into his mouth and he regained his
color.</p><P>"No my youthful
friend what has happened to you?" Lee asked as he stood over Naruto
with a sunset scene above him.</p><P>"I spoke to soon!"
Naruto said as his soul started to go out of his mouth.</p><P>'Must get away,'
Kyuubi thought as she slowly walked away.</p><P>"You're not getting
away," Naruto said as he grabbed onto one of her tails pulling her
closer to him.</p><P>'…must get to
exam,' Sasuke thought as he picked up Naruto and Sakura and dragged
them into the exam room.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"I'm saved,"
Naruto said as he looked inside the room.</p><P>"Baka… you should
just stop…" Sasuke said as he looked around to see other people
looking at him.</p><P>"Sasuke-kun when did
you guys get here?" Ino asked as she latched onto him.</p><P>"Ahh Ino-pig get off
of him," Sakura screamed as she tried to get Ino off of Sasuke.</p><P>"No," Ino said as
she stuck her tongue out at Sakura.</p><P>Meanwhile, "Hey
Shino," Naruto said as he looked over at Shino who was standing
still over by a corner.</p><P>"Naruto… long time
no see," Shino said in his usual quiet voice.</p><P>"Heh sorry about that
I've bust with missions and everything," Naruto said as he
scratched his head with his hand.</p><P>"So when will the
three of us go out again?" Shino asked as Tenten came up to them.</p><P>"Probably after this
test if Naruto doesn't plan on disappearing again," Tenten said
as she grabbed onto both boys shoulders.</p><P>"Seems like Sasuke is
doing something," Naruto said as he looked over at Sasuke to see he
was staring at some cards.</p><P>"He asked information
about you, and Gaara, he just went over the info for Gaara and is
starting on yours," Kyuubi said.</p><P>"This should be
interesting," Naruto said as he went over to see his information.</p><P>"Fencer Uzumaki
Naruto… He has completed over 20 D rank missions. 1 C-rank mission
which turned into an A rank one. His Genjutsu is unknown while his
Ninjutsu is most likely B-rank. As for his Taijutsu he specializes in
weapons and is currently the only one in this city who can use almost
any weapon that is known. He also has a partner which is a kitsune,"
Kabuto said as he picked up his ninja card.</p><P>"So you specialize in
collecting information? Interesting," Naruto said as he stepped
there.</p><P>"Yes and if you'd
like to know go after the sound nin's they are a newly formed
country so they should be weak," Kabuto said not noticing the 3
sound nin's getting ready to attack.</p><P>"Lets go," one of
the sound nin's said as he jumped up with the others and attacked
Kabuto.</p><P>"Nani?" Kabuto said
as he stepped back to dodge a hit from one of the nin's.</p><P>'Sound,' Kyuubi and
Naruto thought as they saw Kabuto fall down and barf.</p><P>"What happened?"
was murmured throughout the class room before some nin's came in
shutting everybody up.</p><P>"All right we're
having the first part of the Chunnin exam so everyone pick a number
and go to that seat," Ibuki said as he motioned for the people to
do so.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>Everyone knows the test
part so I'll be skipping parts of it.</p><P>'Kyuubi you know this
stuff right?' Naruto asked as he looked at Kyuubi.</p><P>'Yes I do… I guess
I can give you the answers,' Kyuubi said as he began to fill in the
answers.</p><P>Tenten</p><P>"Heh it seems as if
Naruto's got the answers… probably from Kyu," Tenten said as
she operated some mirrors which were at the ceiling on the room.</p><P>Shino</p><P>'Got the answers from
him?' Shino asked silently. "Good tell me," Shino said as a fly
buzzed over his paper.</p><P>Naruto</p><P>'tired… time to
sleep,' Naruto thought as he put his head down on the paper
covering it completely.</p><P>'Baka… next time
don't spend all day without sleeping,' Kyuubi thought to Naruto
as she put her head down around Naruto's neck. 'Come to think of
if I didn't get any rest either,' Kyuubi thought as she fell
asleep.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"All right everyone
this is the final question pencils down," Ibuki said. "Now for
the final question (Which I forgot how It went) it will determine
whether you can ever take the chunnin exam again or not," Ibuki
said in a serious voice. put in how the exam question goes with
Naruto interfering</p><P>"All right everybody…
everyone in this room passes," Ibuki said shocking everyone.</p><P>"Thought so,"
Naruto said under his breath</p><P>"Well now everyone…"
Ibuki said only for something to crashed into the window.</p><P>"That was a long wait
everyone but now I'm here," a girl's voice said as she put up a
sign that said follow me for the 2nd exam. "Now everyone
follow me to get to the 2nd exam," the women said as she
jumped out the window again letting the people follow her.</p><P>"We have a crazy
women now…" Naruto said as he held his head.</p><P>'It might get better
Naruto,' Kyuubi thought as they went to the 2nd exam
area.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"All right punks this
is the 2nd exam area," the women said as she pointed to
a forest behind her. "Forest of death," (I think).</p><P>"Doesn't seem that
scary," Naruto said out loud without thinking letting him receive a
kunai which slashed him across the face. 'fast,' Naruto thought
as he felt the presence of the women behind him.</p><P>"Oh really… kids
such as yourself get killed first," the women said as she licked
Naruto's blood which was falling from his cut.</p><P>'The only person who
gets to touch Naruto that way is me and only me!' Kyuubi thought as
she growled at Anko.</p><P>"You know you
shouldn't sneak up on me," Anko said as she pulled out a kunai to
get ready to stab the person behind her.</p><P>'He's that one
person,' Kyuubi thought as she relayed that thought onto Naruto.</p><P>"Sorry… but I get
upset when someone cuts my hair," the man said as he used his long
tongue to pass the kunai back to Anko.</p><P>"Alright but next
time you do that I'll kill you myself," Anko and went in front of
everybody. "Now everybody sign these forms which say that we won't
be responsible for your deaths," Anko said as she gave the forms to
everybody.</p><P>"You know… I can
smell the scent of summoned creatures on you," Naruto said as he
passed by the long haired ninja.</p><P>"You can now? How
interesting," the man said as he went away with sweat drops forming
on his head for some reason.</p><P>'Naruto are you sure
that was a wise thing to say to him?' Kyuubi thought to Naruto.</p><P>"Well… you're
around so I'm not that worried. Besides… all I smelt on him was
some gunpowder probably from those little tank guys," Naruto said
as he tried to remember what type of monster he was talking about.</p><P>'You should just
prepare yourself for the exam,' Kyuubi said as she led Naruto away
by pulling on him.</p><P>'Your right… he
couldn't have gotten that far in summoning,' Naruto thought as he
went to get the form signed and go into the exam.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Let's just go out
for now and think of a plan," Naruto said as his team jumped
through the trees.</p><P>"Sadly I have to
agree with you," Sasuke said as he followed Naruto.</p><P>"If Sasuke agrees
then I'll also," Sakura said as she followed Sasuke closely.</p><P>'Naruto coming in
from the right it's that snake man,' Kyuubi thought to Naruto who
quickly jumped up.</p><P>"Dodge quickly!"
Naruto shouted as he took off Soul Harmony off from it's usual
place, his back.</p><P>"Sakura get down,"
Sasuke said as he grabbed Sakura and jumped down to the forest floor
with her.</p><P>"Kyuubi Weapon
Defense," Naruto shouted getting Kyuubi who was on his shoulder to
glow red before making Naruto's weapon glow red. "Crap," Naruto
shouted as he felt a huge blast of wind blow him off the branch he
was standing and separate him from his team.</p><P>"Naruto!" Sasuke
shouted as he saw Naruto get blasted back and away from sight.</p><P>"Now's not the time
to worry about him Sasuke-kun," Sasuke heard a man say before he
saw the leaf nin which Naruto had talked to earlier.</p><P>"You, what do you
want here?" Sasuke asked as he saw the serpentine like man in front
of them.</p><P>"Want… I want you,"
the man said in a serious voice.</p><P>"KAHHH HENTAI!!!"
Sakura screamed as she started to throw kunai's rapidly at the man.</p><P>"Ah just stop it,"
the man said as more of the kunai's came his way. "Stop it…"
the man said again as he kept on dodging. "STOOOPP!!!" he
screamed as a kunai hit him on his arm. "You'll pay for that,"
the man said as he reached to his neck to pull on a green crystal. "I
summon you summon creature Iron Horse," the man shouted creating a
vortex which let out a green mechanical like dog.</p><P>"What the hell is
that?" Sasuke asked as he looked at the monster in front of him.</p><P>"This is my summoned
creature Iron horse… the strongest one I can summon which doesn't
attack me," the man said the last part silently.</p><P>"Who are you?"
Sasuke finally asked.</p><P>"Orochimaru… now
show me how tough you are Sasuke-kun," Orochimaru asked as he moved
and the iron horse along with him.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Damn it I got
separated," Naruto said as he lifted his sword up and got up from
the rubble he was in.</p><P>'Well you should
watch out since here comes another pain in the butt,' Kyuubi
thought to Naruto as she got on all fours letting her tails fan out
behind her.</p><P>"Ooh a giant snake…
Kyuubi Fire enchant," Naruto said getting a hai from Kyuubi who
charged Naruto's weapon up with a fire element this time.</p><P>'Do you need anything
else?' Kyuubi asked as she looked at the giant snake closing in.</p><P>"This ought to be
nothing… I've fought stronger," Naruto said as he rushed
forward to meet the snake. "<U>Volcanic Spiral Strike</U>,"
Naruto shouted as he jumped forward and started to spin creating some
flames that surrounded him as he spun while rushing towards the
snake.</p><P>'Isn't that
overkill?' Kyuubi asked as she saw Naruto go through the snake with
ease leaving a burnt mark where Naruto jumped through the snake.</p><P>"That doesn't
matter… what really matters is getting back to my team and fast,"
Naruto said as he let Kyuubi climb back onto his shoulder. "Can you
give me an Agility boost?" Naruto asked.</p><P>'Why do you even ask
when you know I'll do it,' Kyuubi said as she glowed a sliver
color before the same silver color surrounded Naruto's shoes.</p><P>"Hang on tight
Kyu-chan," Naruto said as he disappeared creating his own sonic
boom.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>'Damn this guy's
tough,' Sasuke thought as he went through the same seals as last
time. "<U>Katon Goukakyuu no Jutsu</U>," Sasuke shouted as he
shot out a fireball toward the iron horse.</p><P>"Stupid such tactics
won't work on my summon," Orochimaru said as the iron horse
opened up a compartment in front of it before letting out a missile
to the fire ball causing a huge explosion which sent Sasuke back.</p><P>"Shit," Sasuke said
as he flipped backwards to lower the damage from the blast.</p><P>"Too slow,"
Orochimaru said as he appeared in front of Sasuke only to see Sasuke
forming some seals.</p><P>"Shit… Iron Horse
attack," Orochimaru shouted as he jumped away to let his Iron Horse
attack.</p><P>"Shit," Sasuke said
as he tried to form seals quickly.</p><P>"Perform your jutsu
Sasuke I got this," Sasuke heard Naruto before he saw Naruto in
front of him knock the Iron horse away. "Kyu Chain lighting,"
Naruto shouted causing Kyuubi who was on Naruto's shoulder to
release a bolt of lighting at the iron horse.</p><P>'Small fry should not
even be here,' Kyuubi thought as the iron horse fell towards the
forest floor.</p><P>"We should finish
this," Naruto said as he jumped down and stabbed the iron horse as
it was falling. "Wait… don't these usually explode?" Naruto
asked as a huge explosion happened knocking Naruto hard into a nearby
tree.</p><P>'Baka…' Kyuubi
said weakly as she fainted also next to Naruto.</p><P>"Naruto," Sakura
said as she saw him falling.</p><P>"Crap… Sakura do
something," Sasuke said as he went after Orochimaru. 'How did
something like this happen?' Sasuke thought as he did his best to
defend his teammates.</p><P>"Although my summon
creature my have been destroyed I definitely won't lose to you,"
Orochimaru said as he chased after Sasuke in his snake pattern.</p><P>'Gotcha,' Sasuke
thought as he threw three throwing stars at Orochimaru which started
to wrap around Orochimaru.</p><P>"Sharingan
controlled wires?" (forgot what the name was) Orochimaru asked as
he saw the wires wrap around him.</p><P>"This
is the end," Sasuke said as he finished the seals he was doing,
"<U>Katon: Ryuka no Jutsu</U>," Sasuke said as a huge torrent of
flames rushed towards Orochimaru before he was completely covered.
"It's over," Sasuke said as he turned around.</p><P>"You're
perfect," Naruto heard Orochimaru say before he extended his neck
and bit Sasuke on the neck. "That is my gift to you," Orochimaru
said before he cut the wire and disappeared.</p><P>"Sasuke?
Naruto?" Sakura asked as she looked at both of them. "Not good…"
Sakura said as she went over to both bodies and carried them
somewhere else.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"Who
is that boy and why does he know so much about these summons?"
Orochimaru asked as he positioned himself inside a tree. "I must
find out," Orochimaru said as he contacted Kabuto.</p><P>Jounin
Lounge</p><P>"So
who do you think will win?" Kurenai asked as she looked around the
lounge with the other jounin.</p><P>"I'll
put my money on Sasuke," Kakashi said, "Although I have high
hopes for Naruto also," Kakashi said.</p><P>"Oh
favoring someone other then Sasuke? That's was unpredictable,"
Asuma said as he started to smoke.</p><P>"Why
is it that you would favor Naruto also Kakashi? I do know that he is
strong and all and I have no doubts he will become a chunnin but why
choose him?" Gai asked with a regular tone which surprised
everyone.</p><P>"Well
I just found out Naruto's heritage… which I can't believe
myself," Kakashi said a bit shocked from both Gai and Naruto.</p><P>"So
who is he?" Everybody asked in their own tone.</p><P>"He's
the one who was used for the Kyuubi's container… that's all I
will say," Kakashi said getting shocked expressions from everybody.</p><P>"Kyuubi!?!?!
Then shouldn't that kid be restrained!" Kurenai said as she
prepared herself to go out.</p><P>"I
won't let him harm my student," Asuma said as he pulled out his
trench knives and took his cigarette.</p><P>"I
don't really care for one since he's a strong boy who's full of
youthfulness," Gai said confusing everyone.</p><P>"Well
anyway I think you shouldn't do that Asuma… after all one of your
relatives follows him around. As for you Kurenai one of your students
Shino has improved greatly especially finding a way to defend himself
without his bugs," Sarutobi said as he poofed into the room.</p><P>"Hokage-Sama,"
Everybody shouted before bowing.</p><P>"No
need everyone… but as I was saying before if you harm one hair on
him I will personally harm each and everyone of you," Sarutobi said
releasing some killer intent before disappearing.</p><P>"Well
that was unexpected… my dad defending a demon boy," Asuma said.</p><P>"If
he goes against my student I'll personally go after him later,"
Kurenai said.</p><P>"That
is if you can," Kakashi said as he went back to reading his book.</p><p align="center">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p><P>"What
should I do now?" Sakura asked as she looked after her two
teammates under the tree. One of which had a huge fever because of a
mark on his shoulder and one who had serious burns.</p><P>In
the mind.</p><P>"Neh
Kyuubi I'm getting bored here," Naruto said as he looked at
Kyuubi who sat across from him.</p><P>"Well
sorry… at least I take better care of my body," Kyuubi said as
she berated Naruto.</p><P>"Fine…
so how much longer?" Naruto asked.</p><P>"About
1 more hour," Kyuubi said before Naruto fell asleep. "Good
night," Kyuubi said as she grabbed onto Naruto and slept with him.</p><P>A/n
