is a very big A/U. The idea came when I was reading chapter 440. Ever
notice how Minato said he only sealed part of his charka and half of
the Kyuubi in Naruto. That got me wondering where the other half
went. So I came up with this. Also Naruto is going to be way more
powerful in this. Enjoy. Disclaimer portion: I do not own Naruto if
I did a lot of things would be sooo different! Plus I would be
swimming in money. *Starts to sing Money Money from Momma Mia*</P><P>Naruto:

Naruto good work!" Jiraiya called out to his apprentice from the
hole he was in. He had been sparring with Naruto as part of his
three year training. And the boy, or should he say man after all he
was 16, punched him into a hole.</P><P>"I
see training with the Kyuubi has helped." He said as he climbed out
of the hole he was in. Jiraiya's body groaned with the effort. <I>I'm
getting way too old for this, </I>he
thought. He noticed Naruto's out-stretched hand and took it. The
young man pulled him up with little effort.</P><P>"Sorry
ero-sensi," Naruto chuckled rubbing the back of his neck .</P><P><I><U><B>Pervert
had it coming</B></U></I>,
<b><B>Migoto
Kasai aka Kyuubi no Kistune muttered. She was in her hybrid form. A
pair of orange with black tipped ears sat on the top of her head.
Long orange hair flowed down her back. A red kimono off-set her red
silted eyes. Her long fingers had very very sharp claws. Nine golden
orange tails poked out the back. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I><B>Migoto-chan!</B></I></b><b><B>
Naruto wined at her. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I><U>Well
he should have been looking at those girls earlier,</U></I></b><b><B>
the fox woman stated. Naruto nodded his head in agreement. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I><U>Did
you master that justu I was teaching you earlier?</U></I></b><b><B>
Migoto asked</B></b></P><P>Truth
be told Jiraiya at first was not at all happy that Kyuubi had talked
to his student about training him. But Naruto talked Jiraiyia into a
trial period. What could it hurt, Naruto told him. Beside he would
absorb the fox's charka when he was eighteen anyway. Kyuubi no
Kistune had pulled him into his mind and that was something he could
never forget.</P><P><B>(
Que Twilight Zone music for flashback)</B></P><P><I>Naruto
looked around his mind. The place hadn't changed much since the
last time he had been here. He began to walk towards the Kyuubi's
cage. Finally he reached the 50 foot doors and peered into the
darkness.</I></P><P><I>"</I>Yo!
Fuzzball you there?" <I>He
yelled. </I></P><P>"<B>Stop
yelling!</B>"
<I>A
voice called. Moments later the Kyuubi came into view. It was in it's
fox state. </I></P><P>"
<B>So
do you accept my offer of training?</B><I><B>"</B></I><I>
Kyuubi asked. </I></P><P><I>"</I>I
do. But the moment you try and get out Jiraiya will kick your ass so
hard you'll be back in the Underworld!"<I>
Naruto said. </I></P><P><I>"</I><B>Good.
There are a few things you need to know. First I'm a woman. Second
you will be trained in the kistune's ninja way. Three if you choose
to you will be able to summon my clan."</B><I>
To say Naruto was shocked was an understatement. </I></P><P><I>"</I>You're
a woman?!!??! NANI!?"<I>
Kyuubi laughed at the boy. </I></P><P><I>"</I><B>Brat
I'm the Lady Ruler of Hell. My name is Migoto Kasai and I'm going
to make you the best ninja ever."</B></P><P><I>Naruto
nodded and looked thoughtful for a moment. </I></P><P>"Migoto-sensei
why did you attack Kohona?"<I>
He was curious to know. Migoto sighed and looked sad.</I></P><P><I>"</I><B>I
once helped a man. His name was Madara Hyuga. He was a branch member
of the Hyuga clan and he wanted to be great. So I in my foolishness
gave him the </B><B>Sharingan</B><B>.
But I told him, as a joke, I wanted 100 of his descants for a
sacrifice. A hundred years passed and I had a mate by then. We
were…..very happy. I had two kits by that time. One day I went out
to hunt and when I came back Madara was standing in my den. HE KILLED
MY FAMILY!" </B><I>Migoto
cried in pain. </I></P><P><B>"The
bastard told me that Kohona's hokage had ordered the attack. I
chased after the fool blinded by rage. I wanted to destroy the
village. And then your father sealed me inside you during the
fight."</B><I>Migoto
sighed. She hated what she did and was truly sorry for it. </I></P><P><I>"</I>Wait
the Yondaime
Hokage fought you…that means….oh" <I>Naruto
was silent for a moment before yelling. </I></P><P>"My
dad was the Yondaime Hokage!!!" <I>Migoto
chuckled at the boy's antics. He reminded her of her kits. Smiling
at him she spoke. </I></P><P><I>"</I><B>Kit
your dad was the best opinionate I faced. Now we'll start you're
training tomorrow."</B><I>
With that she pushed him out into the real world. </I></P><P>After
that Naruto bugged Jiraiya for information on his parents. And the
old sage told him everything. He smiled at hearing about Kushina and
how he got her last name because Minato was worried about Naruto's
safety. For hours he listened to Jiraiya tell him stories.</P><P>"Alright
kid, that's enough training for today. I'm off to do research!"
And with that Kohona's super pervert whooshed off towards the near
by town. Naruto sighed and decided to go into town as well. They were
running low on supplies. As he entered the small town , Naruto began
to look for a store. Soon he found one. About an hour later he had
everything he needed. Walking back towards the clearing where they
had set up camp, his ears picked up something. Migoto had enhanced
his senses to the point where they were almost as good as Kiba's.</P><P>It
was the sound of a struggle.</P><P>"Demon
bitch!" A man's voice said.</P><P>"Let
go of me!" A girl yelled. Naruto took off towards the direction of
the voices. In an alley way a young girl was bound by ninja wire and
kunais to the wall. A group of what appeared to be chunins
surrounding her.</P><P>"Get
away from her!" Naruto yelled setting down his bags. With lighting
speed he drew out his kunai and let them fly. Both Migoto and Jiraiya
had worked on his speed and weapons skills. The weapons hit their
marks. Soon the ninja were dead. Walking over to the girl he cut the
wire.</P><P>"You
okay? They didn't hurt you or anything?" He asked, sky blue eyes
filled with concern. She shook her head. It was then he noticed
something. The girl had orange and white ears on her head. They were
like Migoto's except a bit wider and longer. A long white tail that
ended with orange was wrapped around her legs. Her hair was orange
with white streaks in it. It came to the end of her shoulder blades.
A red t-shirt read go away with black pants covered her body. A pair
of black combat boots covered her feet.</P><P>"Thank
you for saving me," And with that the girl passed out. Naruto
caught her in time.</P><P><I>Lady
what are you?</I>
He wondered.</P><P>_________----------_____________----------------</P><P>Okay
so I would really enjoy reviews as this is my first Naruto story.</P><P><b><B>Migoto

all. </B></b></P>

what is she?</I>
Naruto asked as he carried her back to the camp. He had his shadow
clones take care of the supplies.</P><P><I><B>Kit
I'm going to say that she's a </B></I><b>hanakki.</b><b><I></I></b><b><B>She
told him. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I><B>She's
a half-demon!!!!</B></I></b><b><B>
Naruto shouted. His tenant rubbed her ears. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I>Damnit
Naruto I told you not to yell in here. </I></b><b><B>Migoto
rubbed her poor ears and sighed. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I>There
are quite a few ways to become one but the most common is when a
demon container merges with its host. Which is the only way they can
truly absorb the demon charka. </I></b><b><B>
She sat crossed legged on a rock waiting for Naruto's response</B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I><B>So
in other words when I turn 18, I'm gonna have fox ears and a tail.
</B></I></b><b><B>Naruto
sweat-dropped at his. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I>Your
hair will get longer, the whiskers more prominate, caine teeth a bit
sharper and longer, oh plus side you'll be stronger and faster
especially with those gravity seals I have on you. Which reminds me,</I></b><b><B>
Migoto did a couple of hand signs and Naruto felt a bit heavier. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I><B>You
could have waited until I was back at the camp not carrying a young
woman, Migoto sensei. </B></I></b><b><B>
He groaned and contunied walking. Soon they reached the camp. He set
the girl gently down on one of the bed-rolls. Sending clones out they
soon came back with an arm full of wood. Naruto created a fire and
began to cook. And no it was not ramen, instead he was cooking a beef
stew. Jiraiya had made sure he didn't eat just ramen all the time. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I>Hey
kit want to let me out of here for a bit,</I></b><b><B>
Migoto asked. Naruto nodded and performed the hand signs for the
Shadow Clone justu. A moment later in the place of the Naruto clone
was Migoto in her red kimono. </B></b></P><P><b><B>"</B></b><b>Thanks
kit.</b><b><B>"
She said stretching. </B></b></P><P><b><B>"It's
no problem. Dinner should be ready soon." He said. With a nod she
went over to look at the girl. Her eyes widened in shock. It wasn't
possible was it? She remembered something that the 4</B></b><b><B>th</B></b><b><B>
had said when Naruto had gone into the 8</B></b><b><B>th</B></b><b><B>
tail mode. It was over a village killing an innocent girl because
they feared she was a demon. </B></b></P><P><b></b><b><I><B>Naruto
stood in front of the cage. His hands where inching towards the seal.
</B></I></b></P><P><b><I><B>"</B></I></b><b>Yes
yes that's it.</b><b><I><B>"
Migoto encouraged. From no where </B></I></b><I>Minato
Namikaze appeared. His hand grabbed Naruto's stopping it. </I></P><P><I>"</I>Hello
son." <I>He
said. </I></P><P><I>"</I>Dad
you're dead what are you doing here?<I>"
Naruto asked clearly confused.</I></P><P><I>"</I>Well
in case foxy here decided to try and escape I sealed a small amount
of my chakra in here as a way to stop you."<I>He
smiled at Naruto. </I></P><P><I>"</I>It
wasn't easy sealing half of the fox's chakra and mine in you but
I didn't become the 4th
for nothing!"</P><P>Migoto
felt sick to her stomach. This girl had her chakra but there was
another presence there as well. Channeling chakra into her hands she
held them above the girl's path-ways. Her eyes couldn't get any
wider.</P><P>"<B>Houkou
you clever wolf</B>."
She stated causing Naruto to look over at her.</P><P>"Is
everything okay?" He asked.</P><P>"<B>Well
yes and no…"</B>
she trailed off.</P><P>"What
did you do now?" Jiraiya appeared and looked at her. His finger
tips where glowing and she could see the kanji in them.</P><P>"<B>It's
not what I did per-say. More like what the Five Tails and his father
did."</B>
She pointed at Naruto.</P><P>"What
did Minato do?" Jiraiya asked.</P><P>"<B>He
only sealed half of my charka into Naruto. Another ¼ went to the
</B><I><B>Shinigami
</B></I><B>as
payment I'm guessing and the last ¼ tried to find a way to survive
which caused it to be sealed…."</B>
She was interrupted by a new voice.</P><P>"In
me. All because my father was dying." The girl now sat up on the
bed roll. Her eyes where pressed back in agitation . She had heard
them talking about sealings. Her father had screwed hers up.</P><P>"And
who's your father?" Jiraiya asked.</P><P>"Houkou
the five tailed wolf. He sealed himself inside me because he was
dying." She stated playing with her fingers.</P><P>"Wait
I thought demons were immortal?" Naruto stated.</P><P>"They
are unless they lose to a fox." She looked over at Migoto and
titled her head.</P><P>"<B>My
charka is has a poison like quality to it. Which is why kit you
can't die from being poisoned."</B>
Migoto explained.</P><P>"After
losing to you, he only had a few hundred years. In the last twenty
years of his life, he met my mother, wooed her, told her everything,
got married and had me. At which point to save himself, he sealed
himself into me. However at the same time your chakra was trying to
find a home. The force of the sealing drew it to me and it got sealed
into me along with my father's charka." When she finished she
looked at all of them.</P><P>"What
no demon bitch? Die demon? Go rot in hell?" She asked scared they
were going to attack her at any moment.</P><P>"Hell
no! I've got Ms. Lady Ruler of Hell in me, you're just a
container not the demon!" Naruto shouted. (<B>I'm
not having him say believe it. Sorry no go. </B>)</P><P>"The
kid's right," Jiraiya stated.</P><P>"<B>I'm
a demon and you are the furtherest thing from it. </B>"
Migoto told the girl.</P><P>"So
do you have a name?" Jiraiya asked.</P><P>"My
name is Ayame
Ookami." Ayame said.</P><P>"I'm
Naruto Uzamaki, that's Jiraiya, and that thing over there is Migoto
 Kasai aka the Kyuubi no Kistune." Naruto introduced them all. A
few moments later dinner was ready and they all ate. The two children
went to sleep a few moments after. Jiraiya looked at Migoto.</P><P>"We
need to talk."</P><P>___-------------_____________________-</P><P>Alright
reviews again are very nice!!!</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P>Alright I just
wanna take this time to say thanks to NeoKyuubi for her ideas they
really are helping so far! Also Ayame means Flower of the moon while
Ookami means wolf. Put her name together and it means flower of the
moon wolf. Because while Gobi is the five tailed dog I'm turning
him into a wolf. This isn't that big of a leap here because dogs
are the decedents of wolves. Again I don't own Naruto or else he
would be amazing and smart. This chapter is mostly going to be Migoto
and Jiraiya talking.</P><P>Normal

followed Jiraiya to the outskirts of the camp. She respected the Toad
Sanin and his power. After all he could seal her into oblivion if he
wanted to. Soon they stopped and just stood for a moment the sounds
of the night covering them.</P><P>"What
do you want Jiraiya-sama?" She asked.</P><P>"I
want you to train Ayame. She has your charka and it would probably
help if you taught her to summon her father." He stated looking at
the night sky.</P><P>She
looked up for a moment before answering.</P><P>"Hai
Jiraiya-sama I can teach the girl." Migoto paused a moment before
continuing, "Jiraiya-sama I will have her sign the summoning
contract for my clan just like Naruto did. She has my chakra just
like Naruto and as Queen of the Kistune I will press my right for her
to understand part of her heritage. " Jiraiya sighed at the news.
He had figured as much.</P><P>"I
understand but if her father has a summoning contract for that clan
then she will have to sign it as well." Migoto nodded. Such was the
way of demons. When a demon chooses to grace a mortal with charka or
gifts, the demon became bound to the mortal and vice-versa. Thus the
summoning contracts had come into play. It was a way for a demon to
grace a mortal while the mortal was bound to them.</P><P>"Jiraiya
will you be teaching Naruto the sage mood?" She asked wondering.</P><P>"Hai."
Came the man's response.</P><P>"Then
he will be the first Fox sage in over 200 hundred years." Jiraiya's
eyes widen at this.</P><P>"You
mean the legends are true?"</P><P>"Hai.
At one time there was a religion centered around me. One of the
followers learned Sage mode but I chose to teach him some Kistune
Justus. It transformed him into the Fox Sage." Migoto turned to
him.</P><P>"Well
as much as I would like the boy to be the next Toad Sage I have a
feeling that being the Fox Sage will help him more. " He told her.
Migoto nodded.</P><P>"I
guess that means our trip just got longer?" She asked. He smiled
and nodded. Beginning to head back to camp, she left the man penning
a note to the current Hokage. In her head she began to think of
training for the girl. She would need to be bulked up and so many
other things. As she entered the camp she noticed the two teenagers
sleeping. Naruto was sleeping peacefully. However Ayame had no such
luck.</P><P>She
tossed and turned, whimpering in her dream world. Ayame was with her
mother. They had gone to buy groceries at the village store. She had
been about five at the time. Her sixteen year old body was trembled
as she knew what happened next. Migoto meanwhile had come closer to
investigate what was wrong with the girl. In her mind Ayame watched
as her mother paid for the food. Walking out the pair ran into a
group of ninjas.</P><P>"<I>Step
away from the demon and we will not hurt you.</I>"
One of them ordered her mother. This caused Ayame to clutch to her
mother's leg.</P><P>"Kaa-san,"
She whimpered. Migoto raised an eyebrow. <I>A
nightmare about her mother? What did the woman do to her</I>?
She wondered as she began to sit next to the girl.</P><P>"<I>My
child is no demon!</I>"
Ayame's mother yelled at the mob. A few seconds later the mob
grabbed her and began to beat her.</P><P>"<I>We'll
purge you of the demon's influence!</I>"
They yelled as they continued to hit her.</P><P>"No
don't hurt Kaa-san!" She whimpered as the nightmare continued.
Migoto began to stroke the girl's hair hoping it would calm the
girl. In the nightmarish memory the mob had finished with her mother
and turned to her.</P><P>"<I>Your
turn!</I>"
One of the ninjas walked forward and began to perform a water justu.
As it was about to hit, Ayame's mother took it. A few seconds later
she was dead. Ayame knelt next to her mother's body and screaming
woke up.</P><P>"KAA-SAN!"
Tears where streaming down the girl's face. Migoto wrapped her arms
around the girl and pulled her into her lap. Ayame buried her head in
the Kyuubi's shoulder as she cried. While stroking the girl's
hair, the fox demon began to sing. It was a lullaby that she used to
sing to her kits at night.</P><P>"<I><B>Your
baby blues<BR>So full of wonder<BR>Your curly cues<BR>Your contagious
smile</B></I>"
The girl was still crying but it was slowing down. Migoto began to
rock the girl.</P><P>"<I><B>And
as I watch</B></I></P><P><I><B>You
start to grow up </B></I></P><P><I><B>All
I can do</B></I></P><P><I><B>Is
hold you tight."</B></I>
Ayame had stop crying but was still clinging to the older woman.
Sensing the girl was stilling anxious she continued to sing.</P><P>"<I><B>Knowing</B></I></P><P><I><B>Clouds
will rage in</B></I></P><P><I><B>Storms
will race in</B></I></P><P><I><B>But
you will be safe in my arms</B></I></P><P><I><B>Rains
will pour down </B></I></P><P><I><B>Waves
will crash around</B></I></P><P><I><B>But
you will be safe in my arms." </B></I>
Ayame had her eyes closed and was slowly starting to fall asleep but
the fox continued to sing.</P><P>"<I><B>My
heart is torn just in knowing<BR>You'll someday see<BR>The truth for
lies<BR>When the<BR>Clouds will rage in<BR>Storms will race in<BR>But
you will be safe in my arms<BR>Rains will pour down<BR>Waves will
crash all around<BR>But you will be safe in my arms" </B></I>
Ayame was on the verge of sleep as Migoto was still singing.</P><P>"<I><B>Castles
they might crumble<BR>Dreams may not come true<BR>But you are never
all alone<BR>Cause I will always<BR>Always love you<BR>Hey I<BR>Hey
I<BR>Will love<BR>Clouds will rage in<BR>Storms will race in<BR>But
you will be safe in my arms<BR>Rains will pour down<BR>Waves will
crash all around<BR>But you will be safe in my arms<BR>In my arms"</B></I>
Migoto looked at the girl. She was asleep. The Kyuubi decided to let
her stay there and closed her eyes for a moment intending to move the
girl in a little while. Soon however she entered dream land.
Meanwhile Jiraiya had sent his message. In a few moments he got a
reply from Tsuande. She gave the go-ahead along with a new bingo
book. Opening it he looked through it memorizing the faces and names.
However one caught him off guard. Heading back to camp he looked for
the girl and found her sleeping in the fox's lap. Tilting his head
to the side he smiled at the scene. Looking back at the bingo book he
began to read it again.</P><P><B>Name:

woke up the next morning very slowly. As she began to stretch she
felt something warm and semi-solid in her hands. Opening her eyes she
noticed that her hand was on Migoto's boob. And it was squeezing.
Migoto was looking at her and smiling.</P><P>"<B>Well
if you wanted that last night you could have asked</B>."
Migoto baited. The teen blushed a color that would rival Hinata.
Jiraiya meanwhile got out his pad of paper and was writing this down.
This would be perfect for the Ichi Ichi Paradise: Girls Gone Wild
Ninja style! (<B>I'm a pervert for
even coming up with that at all……*runs to Tsuande* Beat me please
I need to be purged of my perviness!!!</B>)
This had not gone unnoticed by Migoto.</P><P>"Watch
this." She told Ayame. She began to whip through ten hands signs
before speaking.</P><P>"<I><B>Kistune
bijustu:</B></I> <b><I>Kibaku
Hotaru</I></b><b><B>," The
immortal trickster whispered and opened her mouth. What looked like
small fireflies fluttered out of her mouth and towards Jiraiya. Soon
they landed on his pad and hands. Migoto made the tiger hand sign and
mouthed</B></b></P><P><b><B>"</B></b><b>Boom"</b><b><B>
A second later the fireflies exploded causing the paper and Jiraiya's
clothes on fire. Naruto woke to Jiraiya's yells of "Noo! My
research" and the fox's laughter. He figured Jiraiya had done
something perverted again.</B></b></P><P><b><B>"Serves
you right Ero-Sensei!" He yelled.</B></b></P><P><b><B>"Brat!
I told you not to call me that!" Jiraiya yelled while putting out
the fire. Ayame's face showed confusion.</B></b></P><P><b><B>"Pervert
sensei? Isn't that a bit disrespectful for a Sanin?" Naruto and
Migoto looked at her with shock. She then realized no one said
anything about him being a Sanin. </B></b><b><I><B>Shit.
</B></I></b><b><B>Was the only
thing that came to mind. </B></b></P><P><b><B>"How
did you know he was a Sanin?" Naruto asked. </B></b></P><P><b><B>"Doesn't
everyone?" She questioned back. </B></b></P><P><b><B>"Only
shinobi would. Right </B></b>Getsuei
Ookami Issui Mizu?" Jiraiya asked.</P><P>"Moon Wolf
of Water? Where have I heard that name before?" Naruto asked
Jiraiya.</P><P>"Because I
was one of Kirigakure's best ninjas. I also trained the team that
passed three chunin during the recent chunin exams." She stated.</P><P>"You're
the only who helped save the Naruto bridge! You took on 400 bandits
single handedly with only a white wolf!" Naruto shouted. Ayame
covered her ears.</P><P>"Is he
always like this?" She asked Migoto.</P><P>"<B>Try
living in him</B>." Migoto shuttered
before continuing, "<B>Ramen
twenty-four seven."</B></P><P>"It's the
only thing I could buy!" He whined at her. She nodded and smiled
letting him know that she was playing with him at the moment. Naruto
thought for a moment.</P><P>"If you are
a Kirigakure shinobi what are you doing here?" To Ayame it looked
like he was relaxed, however to Jiraiya and Migoto he was ready to
attack in a second.</P><P>"I defected
from Kirigakure. I was ordered to kill someone precious to me just
because they were different. Instead I chose to ignore the mission
and ran. I've been running ever since." She figured it was in her
best interests to be honest. She maybe strong but to fight the
jinchuuriki, Migoto, and Jiraiya all at
once was suicide. The three, mentioned above, looked at each and
nodded.</P><P>"Because
you've been honest," Naruto began.</P><P>"Migoto and
I have decide," Jiraiya continued.</P><P>"<B>To
train you. After all it's my fault you are like this. Well partly</B>."
Migoto stated.</P><P>"Your
training with us will end when you are eighteen." Jiraiya told her.
She nodded. At this point Migoto looked at her strangely.</P><P>"<B>How
old are you?"</B> She asked the young
woman.</P><P>"I'm
sixteen. Why?" Ayame wondered.</P><P>"<B>Hanakki
become so at eighteen</B>." The
demoness stated.</P><P>"Oh well
Otusan said that it was because my body couldn't handle your charka
and his so he forced it to happen when I was younger." Ayame
explained.</P><P>"When's
your birthday?" Naruto asked curious.</P><P>"November
24, why?" She asked.</P><P>"I'm
older than you!" He exclaimed. She shook her head at his antics.</P><P>" <B>I
guess that makes Kit your older brother</B>."
Migoto chuckled.</P><P>"NANI!!!"
The two teens yelled. Migoto sighed and explained.</P><P>"<B>You
both have my chakra therefore you are related. Because you both have
so much it's like you're my kits. So Naruto is like your Oniisan
while you are like his imoutosan. Which would make me like you're
kaa-san, do you understand?"</B> She
asked.</P><P>"Hai
kaa-san!" They both stuck out there tongues at her.</P><P>"<B>Brats</B>."
She huffed although she was secretly pleased. Jiraiya chuckled.</P><P>"Alright
Naruto I'm going to began training you Sage mode. Once you've
mastered it, Migoto is going to teach you the Fox Sage mode. Ayame,
Migoto is in charge of your training." The two teens nodded and the
rest of the day was spent training.</P><P>(<B>A
year later</B>)</P><P>Naruto was
sitting next to Migoto while Ayame and Jiraiya had gone to a local
town near their camp. It was a new town and new camp. Normally Naruto
would love to explore it but he was tired from his training that
Migoto had put it through. He decide though it would be pleasant to
strike up a conversation with her while they waited for their
companions.</P><P>"Ayame has
come pretty far in her training huh?"</P><P>"<B>Hai.
She is a natural at using my justus as well as her father's. Plus
using that wolf of her's in battle she's nearly unstoppable.
Using her father's blade, Getsuei Shikon, almost nothing can touch
her. Plus having the wolf and fox contract is a good ace in the hole
as well</B>." She was proud of how her
other kit had come along. Their relationship had evolved from beyond
teacher and student. Something in the girl reminder her of herself.
So she had become Ayame's kaa-san and Ayame had become her musume.</P><P>"And you
have come pretty far yourself, Naruto-kun." The fox stated. They
sat there for awhile before Naruto turned to her. Kami, she was a
goddess in human form.</P><P>"Migoto-chan?"
He asked.</P><P>"<B>Hai
Naruto-kun</B>?" She replied turning
to him. He started at her ruby eyes for a moment before biting his
lip. Migoto chuckled it made him look rather cute. He closed his blue
eyes before speaking.</P><P>"I love
you." That was all that needed to be said. They both closed the gap
between them. Their first kiss was the right mix of passion and love.
They kissed for a moment before Migoto began to remove Naruto's
black and orange jacket. At this point he stopped her.</P><P>"Migo-chun
I'm not sure if I want to do this." He stated. Migoto's face
fell.</P><P>"<B>Oh
I'm gomen Naru-kun."</B> She
apologized.</P><P>"Ero-sensei
could find us and I'd rather not deal with that. Besides I think a
bed roll in a tent is more comfortable." Naruto told her leading
her to his tent with a foxy grin. Her's was a mirror image.</P><P>(<B>A
year later</B>)</P><P>A group of
five people stood in front of Kohona's gates. A man with spiky
blond hair sighed as he looked at it. The older white haired man
looked at him.</P><P>"Miss it
much?" Jiraiya asked Naruto.</P><P>"Hell
yeah!" He replied, surprisingly not shouting. Migoto stood next to
him in a green kimono off-setting her crimson eyes and hair. His
placed a hand on Naruto's orange and black jacket. The only thing
that was different about his appearance from a year ago was the coat.
It had the kanji on the back which read "Fox Sage." Along with
the coat reached down to his ankles. He also had a tattoo on his arm
for the fox contract. Along with that he had a red sheathed sword
strapped to his back. It was like looking at Minato again minus the
summoning tattoo & sword of course. A small girl stood next to
her. She was wearing a white kimono with long blond hair in a
pony-tail. However two strands hung on either side of her face where
a crimson red along with her bangs. Blue eyes flecked with specks of
ruby looked at the other woman, holding her arms out to her.</P><P>The woman
scoped the child up and placed her on her shoulder. The woman's
orange hair was tied up in a low pony-tail and its white streaks
where more noticeable. She was wearing black pants along with combat
boots of the same color. A black tank-top covered her upper half. A
red jacket covered her back. A black sheathed sword with the kanji
for moon and fang. On the back of the jacket was the kanji for "Moon
Wolf." On her right arm she had summoning tattoos for both fox and
wolf. A large white wolf sat at her feet. Her right hand stroked the
wolf's ears.</P><P>"<B>Ayame
Ookami Uzamaki! What have I told you about putting </B><B>Kushina
on your shoulders</B>!" Migoto played the part of concerned mother
very well.</P><P>"Ahh Kaa-san sitting on my
shoulder gives her a better view." Ayame argued playfully with her
mother. And the last name of Uzamaki had been given to her by Naruto.
During their training they became family so he made her his
imoutosan. This only made Jiraiya and Migoto's
headaches bigger when they went on a pranking spree.</P><P>"Migo-chan
relax. She won't drop her." Naruto re-assured his wife. They had
gotten married after their "extra training" had resulted in
Kushina Hoshi Uzamaki. However they both knew that as a Kaa-san
Migoto didn't have much time. If she didn't merge with Naruto
soon they would both die. However they were going to cherish the time
that they had together before she went back to the spirit world.</P><P>"<B>Fine
just this once. Do you hear?</B>" She
looked at Ayame who nodded.</P><P>"Well lets
go." Jiraiya said. And with that they marched forward towards the
gates. Ayame soon held the girl in her arms. Looking down Kushina
pointed to the wolf. Ayame looked at Migoto.</P><P>"Kaa-san
if Kukiko allows it can Kushi-chan ride her? I do plan for my mei to
learn how to summon and have a companion wolf." She stated.</P><P>"<B>As
long as she gets a fox as well</B>."
Migoto shook her finger at her and nodded her consent to let the
child ride the snow white wolf. Ayame looked at Kukiko.</P><P>"Hey
Kukiko can Kushi-chan ride you?" she asked.</P><P>"<B>Hai.
You have no need to ask as clan head though. You could order me.</B>"
Kukiko chuckled as Ayame placed the girl on her and the girl grabbed
on.</P><P>"I
know it just doesn't feel right." She told her. They did this as
they were walking and continued to head in the direction of Kohona's
gates.</P><P>The guards
stood at attention the moment the group came forward.</P><P>"State your
names." One of them asked in a monotone voice.</P><P>"Naruto
Uzamaki, my wife Migoto Uzamaki, my sister Ayame Ookami Uzamaki, her
nin wolf (this got quite an eyebrow raise and shifting of weight)
Kukiko, my daughter Kushina Hoshi Uzamaki, and my sensei Jiraiya of
the Sanin." Naruto stated. The guard's eyes widened.</P><P>"Hokage-sama
stated that if you were to return to report directly to her office."
The guard stated. With a nod they flickered to the Hokage's office
and walked in.</P><P>_--------___________________--</P><P>Translation

ANBU guards. Instantly they stood at attention at the sight of the
white haired Sanin and his group. Opening the door for the group of
five plus the wolf, the group filled into the Hokage's office.
Ayame chuckled at the ANBU's reaction to Kukiko. By this time
Kushina was asleep in her mother's arms. Naruto smiled at the
image in front of him.</P><P>Tsunade was asleep on the desk. An
empty bottle was next to her and paperwork was stacked up all around
her. Ayame looked at Jiraiya.</P><P>"Maybe we should come back
later?"</P><P>Naruto giggled "Nope watch this."
He snuck up on Tsunade until he was by her ear.</P><P>"HEY BAA-CHAN WAKE UP!!!!!"
Naruto shouted. A second later Tsunade's fist launched out throwing
Naruto into a wall.</P><P>"Uzamaki Naruto leave me alone."
She muttered tiredly. She had a headache from the sake and just
wanted to sleep. <I>Wait Naruto?</I> She thought waking up instantly.</P><P>"Naruto!" She screamed hugging
the boy who landed on the floor in a daze. Ayame laughed at the sight
while Migoto frowned at her husband's antics. Jiraiya was pulling
out his notebook and giggling. Ayame raised an eyebrow at Migoto.</P><P>"Naruto or Jiraiya?" She asked
the demoness.</P><P>"Naruto." The demoness
answered. The two women sprang into action. Migoto set Kushina onto
Kukiko and pried Naruto from Tsuande's hug and scolded him.</P><P>"Baka! What have I told you about
being stupid!!" Migoto continued to scold them.</P><P>Meanwhile Migoto completed some
hand signs and whispered.</P><P>"<I><B>Suiton Ookami tsume</B></I>"
A claw of water headed straight for Jiraiya. Sadly he didn't notice
until it was too late. The claw cut through the notebook and the
water destroyed the writing. Jiraiya went into a long monologue about
how she ruined the perfect art. Tsuande sighed. Her headache was
getting bigger. Meanwhile Kushina had woken up. Her bright blue eyes
looked around the room. She looked at Tsuande and slowly walked over
to the woman. Tsuande was massaging her temples when she felt a tug
on her jacket.</P><P>"Eh?" Looking down she saw
Kushina. However something was different about the young girl. A pair
of blonde fox ears twitched on top of her head and a small fluffy
blonde-red foxtail was around her legs. For a moment they stared at
each other before Kushina spoke in a hesitant voice.</P><P>"Ob-oba-oba-chan?" She smiled.
For a moment the whole entire room stared in silence and horror at
the pair. Tsuande picked up the girl by her arm-pits and looked at
her. And smiled back before answering.</P><P>"Hai!" With that she hugged the
girl to her. Kushina giggled and played with the Slug Sanin's
pony-tail.</P><P>"And who are your tou-san and
kaa-san?" Tsuande asked as she smiled at the girl. Kushina smiled
and pointed to Naruto.</P><P>"Tou-san," her finger moved to
point at Migoto, "Kaa-san." Tsuande's eyebrow twitched. Naruto
sighed.</P><P>"Tsuande-sama, please let me
explain." Naruto said as he sat down. Tsuande nodded partly in
shock of the fact Naruto had a child and that he was being
respectful. A few hours later Naruto explained his training, Migoto
being the Kyuubi, Kushina, Ayame, and their trip. Tsuande sighed and
looked at him.</P><P>"You never make anything easy
Gaki." She told him.</P><P>"Nope." He smiled his trade
mark smile. Tsuande looked at Ayame.</P><P>"And why are you here?" Ayame
sighed.</P><P>"I need a village and Naruto said
that you would let me join." Ayame had learned it was easier to
tell the truth instead of beating around the bush. She looked at
Jiraiya and Naruto.</P><P>"What level do you say she's
at?"</P><P>"Sanin." They both stated.
Tsuande's eyes went wide.</P><P>"I can't just make her a Sanin.
Unofficially I can but the most I can make her is a Jonin." They
looked at Ayame.</P><P>"That's fine I was a Jonin in
Mist anyways." Tsuande looked at her.</P><P>"Mist has only one missing nin
who is a Jonin that's unaccounted for."</P><P>"Getsuei
Ookami Issui Mizu. That would be me." Ayame said. Tsuande sighed.</P><P>"Great more
paperwork for me." Opening a desk drawer she tossed Ayame a vest
and a Leaf headband.</P><P>"Congratulations
you're a Jonin of the Leaf. However for a month you can only do C
ranked missions." Ayame shrugged. She would still get money either
way.</P><P>"Thank you
Tsuande-sama." She bowed. Pulling of her jacket, along with her
sword, she put on the vest and then added her jacket and sword.</P><P>"Oba-chan
purrty." Kushina giggled as she played with the older woman's
pig-tail. Jiraiya's perverted giggle could be heard.</P><P>"Tsuande-hime
is very purrty," he purred. Kushina looked at the Toad Sage.</P><P>"
Erro-sunin." She stated causing the three other people to laugh at
Jiraiya's crying. After a moment, Tsuande rummaged around in her
desk again and pulled out another vest. Throwing it to Naruto he
caught it.</P><P>"Baa-chan
you're promoting me to Jonin as well? But what about the Council?"
He asked.</P><P>"Screw
them. I'm Hokage and if I like I could disband the Council. In fact
I think someone should remind them of their place." With that
Tsuande cracked her knuckles. Everyone smiled and Naruto put on his
vest under his jacket.</P><P>"Now I'm
sure Jiraiya told you who your parents were?" Naruto nodded. "Then
that means I can show you your house. Your parents left you a huge
house and a fortune." Naruto was stunned. This was the first he
heard of a house and money.</P><P>"Can we go
now?" He asked scared it was a dream. Tsuande nodded and motioned
them to follow her. As they were walking through the Leaf village
Ayame looked at Tsuande.</P><P>"Hokage-sama,
may I explore the village. Kikiku can get me and lead me back to
Naruto's house." Ayame ask. Tsuande nodded and Ayame looked at
Kikiku.</P><P>"Kikiku go
with Naruto and come find me after they get to his house." Kikiku
nodded.</P><P>"<B>Hai
Ayame-Sama.</B>" The wolf said. A
vein twitched on Ayame's head.</P><P>"Kikiku
drop the sama." With that she began to walk off.</P><P>"<B>Hai,
Ayame-Sama.</B>" She called to the
retreating figure. Ayame heard it and refused to response to the
wolf. As she was walking down the street of Leaf, Ayame didn't
notice a white blur running towards her.</P><P>"WATCH
OUT!" A voice yelled at her. But it was too late. The huge white
dog knocked her down.</P><P>_____-----------__________________________-----------------------</P><P>Hehe Next
chapter is Kiba and Ayame's first meeting!!!!</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>Ayame growled as she hit the ground with a loud thump and she grabbed the white blob that knocked her down, throwing her arms around its neck and brought it to the ground with her. A loud yip came from it and she let go instantly feeling bad for the poor creature she had taken down to the ground. Looking closely, she could see it was a large white nin dog with tawny ears and big brown eyes staring at her.</P><P>"<I>Hey, sorry about that."</I> She said using her father's language to hopefully understand the dog.</P><P>"<I>It's ok. Alpha Kiba-nii-san said we get to go play fetch and I ran too fast. You smell like ookami, reminds me of Alpha Kiba-nii-san." </I>The nin dog would have said more but he was interrupted by the sound of a man yelling.</P><P>"Akamaru!"</P><P>"<I>Alpha Kiba-nii-san!" </I>The white dog barked happily. Ayame turned towards the sound of the yelling and her eyes met chocolate ones. A mop of wild messy brown hair bounced as a black jacket with its owner's body. She felt her cheeks heat up as the man speed closer.</P><P>"What have I told you about running off?" The man, whom she assumed was Kiba began to scold his companion. And here she thought that someone who worked with animals would understand how to handle them. Also his stench was starting to give Ayame a headache, it was a cross between unwashed man and wet dog. Growling she stood up and began to yell at the man annoyed that he was suppose to be an alpha and yet couldn't handle his own pack, plus his smell.</P><P>"Hey Mutt. It's your own damn fault that he ran ahead! If you were able to be a better Alpha you might be able to control your dog and have more a successful love life." Kiba Inuzuka growled at her and he let lose a small bit of weak killing intent that she shrugged off with a chuckle. He sniffed at her and growled.</P><P>" Don't attack all high and mighty with me runt. All I smell is a scared little runt of a ookami who needs a good ass kicking."</P><P>"Big words baka inu. But do you have the guts to back it up? Or are you a whiny bitch?" She taunted and fingered the handle of her sword as she scratched her shoulder. Ayame knew that she could take the dog ninja in a second or less if he was angry and cocky. Her hair blew in the small summer breeze as she waited for him to attack recklessly and sure enough he snarled as he charged at her. Ayame could feel the blood rushing through her veins and couldn't wait to have fun with this little brat. Maybe he'd learn not to insult his superiors after this.</P><P>"I'll get you for that, you bitch!" She ducked as he sailed over her, claws extended in a swipe. With little effort Ayame cupped both of her hands together, fingers slightly curled and pressed flat, palms upward into Kiba's stomach with a loud smack.</P><P>"Ooakami Gestu: Ooakami tsume!" She shouted out the name of her attack, infusing it slightly with chakra for an extra sting. Ayame titled her head to the side as she watched the poor jounin ninja roll across the ground. Kiba, meanwhile, was wondering what the heck had hit him as he slowly sat up with a groan. The dog using jounin was about ready to attack the strange woman again when his gut started to feel like it was on fire.</P><P>"I wouldn't move to much if I were you." Ayame cautioned as she petted Akamaru and giggled as he licked her being rewarded with a scratch behind his ears. She continued to explain the basics of her style.</P><P>"The Ooakami Gestu style is very much like that weird white eyed clan style that lives here, as it forces chakra into someone else's body. However a true master can use it to cause internal, external, and even in some cases, mental damage by chakra alone. Add in the fact that it uses claws and strength combined with speed, you are lucky I didn't turn you into chow for your puppy here. All I did was cause a really bad stomach ache which it should be fine in about ten minutes if you don't move much." She would have taunted him more if not for the familiar voice of her wolf companion.</P><P>"<B>Ayame Ooakami!"</B> The pure white demon wolf bellowed at her with Kushina hanging on to the scruff of her neck. Behind the wolf a small purple fox with a single tail followed. As it got close enough, it leapt on to Ayame's shoulder and curled around her neck, purring as her normal human summoner scratched her ears.</P><P>"Oh hello Hana. When did you get here?" She asked the fox ignoring a fuming Kukkio.</P><P>"<B>A few minutes ago actually. Naruto-sama asked both of us to fetch you, as he feared you might get into trouble."</B> The fox jerked her head over towards Kiba.</P><P>"Now look, he was yelling at Akamaru-kun over here. I wasn't going to let him get away with that. No one should ever insult their companions. They have feeling and thoughts just like we do!" She waved her hands as she spoke, almost as if she was trying to get some invisible audience to agree with her .</P><P>"<B>Ayame-sama! You are the leader of the Ooakami clan and as such you will behave like it! Is that understood?</B>" Kukkio yelled at the ninja causing her to stare at her feet in shame.</P><P>"Hai Kukkio. Come on lets get out of here before dog boy decides to put himself in the hospital." She turned and grabbed Kushina, placing her on her other shoulder causing her to giggle. Ayame smiled as she continued to walk holding her niece in her arms. Meanwhile Naruto was with Migoto wandering around the house that his parents had left him. Jiyara had told him everything that he had known about Minato and Kushina but that only got him so far. The married couple were holding hands as they slowly glided through each room, just taking in the ghosts of the memories and the feel of the place. Finally Naruto spoke.</P><P>"You know, this will be a great place to raise Kushina."</P><P>"Yes and all those other little brats that you will have after her."</P><P>"Migo-hime, I told you. I'm not remarrying after you go back to hell. I can't put myself through that whole process again." Naruto growled at her and stormed off back towards were the kitchen was not wanting to marry someone after the love of his life. He paused, his deep blue eyes watching Jiyara and Tsunade joking and getting into his sake bar.</P><P>"You know, Kushi-chan will be back soon. I'd hate to have to kick her godparents out for their bad examples for my little hime. Now what's it going to be?" He asked as he leaned against the kitchen door way. The two Sanin looked at each other, sighed, and put the sake away.</P><P>"Good." He moved over to the fridge and noticed that it was full stocked.</P><P>"Eh, Baa-chan, did you do this?" Tsunade felt a tick appear above her head as she watched the young blonde pull out a piece of bread and began to eat it.</P><P>"Yes, a genin team was assigned the D-rank misson of getting your house into order. And speaking of genin teams, Naruto…." Her voice had sounded like honey and then dragged off as his brain realized what she was asking.</P><P>"You…want me to teach some brats how to be ninja? Hell, that's like asking Jiyara how to teach a baby to speak." He replied as Jiyara squawked out some protest, pointing out that he helped Kushina learn how to say certain words.</P><P>"Fine then. Naruto Uzumaki Namikazi, as Hokage, I am ordering you to train and supervise Genin Team 7 as their Jounin sensei. Do I make myself clear?" The Hokage's voice left no room for argument.</P><P>"Hai Hokage-sama," Naruto stressed each word and paused as the information caught up with him, "WAIT YOU WANT ME TO TRAIN TEAM SEVEN!" The two Sanin covered their ears and waited a moment as the echoes of the shout died down. They both could understand why he would not want to teach Team Seven as his original team nearly killed him or abused him.</P><P>"Yes I want you to train Team 7. However, they are slightly different then your Team 7." Reaching inside her robes she pulled out three scrolls and tossed them to Naruto, who caught them easily.</P><P>"These are your team's status and bios. Let's hope that you do better at teaching than Kakashi did." Naruto growled at the mention of his former sensi's name.</P><P>"Damn bastard. It's lucky Jiyara came along or I would have died long before now because of his favoritism." He muttered and pocketed the scrolls to look at later.</P><P>"Kushi-chan, wait…DON'T!" Ayame's shout was followed by a blonde and red streak attack Naruto and knocking him to the ground in a fit of giggles.</P><P>"And how's my Kushi-hime? Hmm?" Naruto chuckled as the little girl wrapped her arms around his neck and squeezed tight.</P><P>"Ame-chan got in a fight with doggy man." The small tot proceeded to poke Naruto. "Kushi wants ice cream….please Tousan?" The little girl a puppy dog pout on him and he broke down completely.</P><P>"How bout you go find Kaa-san and we'll all go ok?" The little girl nodded and ran off as Naruto turned to Ayame, who had sent Kukkio with her niece. Hana had fallen asleep around her neck and she left the sleeping fox where it was.</P><P>"So, a fight?" Naruto asked crossing his arms.</P><P>"What does it matter? It was some baka mutt who couldn't keep his mouth shut. I did him a favor." A second later Naruto was glaring at her.</P><P>"That man happens to be a clan heir and my friend. You lucky if this doesn't start some sort of war!" He shouted at her.</P><P>"Damn him and his clan then! If I start a war over something I believe in then good! So piss off foxy!" She shouted back. Tsuande, meanwhile, had slowly gotten off of her seat and began to move forward. Jiyara grabbed her arm, effectively stopping her .</P><P>"Don't. Naruto is just calming her down. She has anger issues due to both the Gobi and Kyubi's chakra in her." She whirled at him and glared.</P><P>"You're telling me that she's the holder of both the Nine-Tailed Fox and the Five-Tail Wolf? Minoto sealed the fox in Naruto!"</P><P>"Well, yes and no. A fourth of the fox's chakra is in her body and the wolf is her father. It's all very complicated." As Jiyara explained Ayame's background, said young woman was continuing to glare at Naruto until she finally started laughing.</P><P>"Only took you four minutes this time to cool down it's a new record. Maybe you're not as thick headed as we believed." Naruto taunted and was soon being chased around the house for it. The two Sanin watched and continued to just stare as the two chased each other. Finally Migoto came out of one of the bedrooms and grabbed them both by the collar of their clothes.</P><P>"What have I told you about running in the house?" She scolded the young adults caught in her grip.</P><P>"Not to do it." They both answered.</P><P>"That's right. Since you two can't seem to follow the rules, we are having a nice long training season tomorrow at 5 am to deal with that habit. Are we clear?" The two groaned at the woman who just crossed her arms at them.</P><P>"Yes hime," Naruto mumbled and Ayame sighed and nodded her head.</P><P>"Good, now Ayame, we are short a jounin senseis this year and I know you have experience so will you accept been jounin sensei of Team 10?" Tsunade asked her and the young wolf summoner nodded.</P><P>"Hai Hokage-sama, I will be their sensei. May I ask a question?" Tsunade raised an eyebrow and nodded as the young kunoichi continued.</P><P>"I was wondering if I could make an actual clan because the effects that my father's sealing had on me. I've noticed I am like an Inuzuka but I seem to have better sense and wolves as companions and summons instead of dogs. Also we have a distinct style that seems to blend the weird white eyed clan and the Inuzuka form." The Hokage closed her eyes for a moment debating on how to answer the girl. On the one hand it would be a good idea to have another clan strengthening the village, however the Hyuga would feel outraged by the girl's style not to mention it was unknown how the Inuzuka clan would react. Sighing the former gambler looked at her and spoke.</P><P>"At the moment I have to think on the matter, however I will let you know when I reach a discussion." Standing up, she brushed off her clothes, " In the meantime you four enjoy your day off and have fun. Naruto and Ayame, the genin teams are being announced tomorrow. I would like you at the academy at oh eight hundred. Am I clear?" The two answered with a Hai hokage sama and baa-chan.</P><P>"After you met your teams please come to my office so you can update your ninja registration. Also Ayame, would you still like to be known as Getsuei Ookami Issui Mizu or Getsuei Ookami Issui Ha?" Ayame thought for a few moments before answering.</P><P>"Getsuei Ookami Issui Ha, or when I become a Sanin Hokage-sama," she stated with mirth because Tsuande knew that both she and Naruto were at Sanin level and they had two summoning contracts that no one else in the village or in the ninja world had, " The Ookami Sanin." Tsuande nodded and bid the group good bye pulling Jiraiya along to get a full report on the past five years. Ayame smiled at Naruto and Migoto before yawning.</P><P>"Well, I'm beat, don't stay up too late you two." With that she skamped down the hallway determined to find her room. Kushina tugged on her father's jacket and he scooped her up tickling her.</P><P>"And what does my Kushi-chan want to do?" She giggled as he tickled her again.</P><P>"Ice-cream!" The little girl exclaimed and looked over at her mother pleading.</P><P>"Oh alright, ice-cream it is!" The two blondes jumped up and down for joy as Migoto laughed at them.</P><P>"Don't forget to henge Kushi." Her mother reminded her and the two watched as the girl scrunched up her face and soon her ears and tails faded out of view. Naruto congratulated her, causing her to smile even wider and the three of them left the house to explore Kohona.</P><P>Please read and review</P><P>And first meeting between Ayame and Kiba, poor guy ;)</P>
