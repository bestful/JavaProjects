"They can perform the jutsus, but their skills with tests aren't very sharp." He sighs and looks at the test on top. "Maybe we should have a day when all we do is review chakra points and the ways of the shinobi." "<I>A</I> day? Did you just say <I>a</I> day?" you ask, looking up at him in disbelief. He holds his hands up in defense and answers, "Hey, we spent two whole weeks on those things. Why change <I>our</I> schedules because <I>they</I> weren't paying attention?" You blink, then look down at the papers and finger through them again. "I guess you're right. This time we'll just have to make them take notes." "And how do you suppose we'll accomplish that?" he asks, walking over to the desk. You frown in thought, then smile and look back up at him. "We tell them that we're going to be checking their notes right before exams and take that into consideration when we're deciding whether to pass them or not. I mean, being a ninja has to do with taking note of things too, right?" Iruka pauses, then smiles back at you and nods. "You're as brilliant as ever, Kage." "I know. ...Wait, so is it my turn to take the tests or yours?" you ask, holding the tests up. He immediately points at you. "Oh no, I'm still trying to finish grading the last tests. Don't even try pinning those on me." You sigh, then hit yourself on the head with the tests lightly. "Ugh, I hate grading tests!" "I know. That makes it so much more fun to torture you with it," he answers, messing up your hair again. You scowl and smooth it back down, then open your mouth to scold him. However, a loud, somewhat familiar voice calls out, "Iruka-sensei!" You both turn toward the door. You duck behind Iruka and peek from behind him when you find it's someone you don't know. The blond-haired, blue-eyed man walks in, hands in his pockets, and smiles at him widely. "Haven't seen you in a while, sensei. How 've you been?" Iruka smiles back and nods slightly. "It has been a while, hasn't it? I've been fine. Excellent, actually, with Kage helping me now," he answers, and motions to the place where you once stood. The blond leans forward slightly, brows furrowed, then asks, "Is Kage invisible, or did she disappear without you knowing?" Iruka blinks, then looks over his shoulder at you. You blush and smile a little, waving up at him silently. He rolls his eyes, turns, grabs your arm, and pulls you so you're not standing behind him anymore. "<I>This</I> is Kage. Kage Ryu. She started working with me last year. Kage, this is Uzumaki Naruto." You bow to him quickly. "Pleasure to meet you, Uzumaki-san." Naruto blinks at you innocently, then bows back, not taking his hands out of his pockets. "Nice to meet you too, Ryu-san." Iruka crosses his arms, then frowns at you and states, "You know there <I>is</I> such a thing as being <I>too</I> polite." You stand up straight and scowl up at him. "I can't help it!" "...I know," he answers, still frowning at you, then looks back at Naruto. "She won't tell you this herself, because she's too shy, but she'd prefer it if you call her by Kage ." Naruto tilts his head, then smiles at you like ^-^. "You don't have to be shy around me. I don't bite, believe it." You blush and duck your head slightly. "Okay, Uzumaki-san." He pauses, then crosses his arms over his chest and frowns a little. "That makes me feel old. Just call me Naruto." You nod slightly, not looking up at him. "Okay, Naruto-san." He blinks, then opens his mouth to say something. Iruka, however, cuts him off. "Don't even bother, Naruto. She still calls me by sensei, and we're coworkers. She only calls one person by only their name, and that's Hyuuga Neji. For what reason, I cannot fathom, but she does." Naruto blinks at you again, then looks up at Iruka. "Hey, can I talk to you about something later, Iruka-sensei?" "Sure, Naruto." You frown and put a hand to your chin, then point at him and state, "You have a very large rip in your vest, Naruto-san." He blinks at you in confusion, then turns and looks down at his vest. "Oh, damn. I better get that fixed before my genin get back, or Ina-chan is going to bite my head off." "One of your students will bite your head off?" Iruka asks, smiling a little. Naruto scowls at him. "That's not funny! Damn, I haven't had <I>time</I> to slack off teaching, believe it! That's gotta be my most prepared cell of genin ever!" he exclaims, scowling at the tear. Iruka raises an eyebrow, then answers, "Good." "Hey!" You blush, then yank on Iruka's sleeve lightly, gaining his attention. He looks down at you. "Hm?" "Um... I'm pretty good at mending things," you state quietly. He blinks at you, then looks at Naruto. "Kage will fix your vest for you. I've some of her work. She's way too modest." You and Naruto frown and tilt your heads. Iruka frowns at you, then glances back up at Naruto. "When a girl wants a fancy kimono or dress, they go to her. The finished products are dazzling. Lots of ninja go to her for some tailoring. I know Kakashi goes to her quite often. ...What he does to actually rip his clothes, I can't imagine. Fall out of a tree while he's reading his book, maybe?" Naruto laughs, then slips his vest off. "Alright, thanks, Kage. I'll pick it up from you in a couple of days, okay?" You nod slightly and fold the vest up, then rest the stack of tests on top of it and grab a few books off of Iruka's desk. "Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Iruka-sensei. Ramen on me, okay?" Iruka frowns. "I hate to have you pay for me, Kage. You paid the last last two times. I'll pay." You blush. "Oh, but you don't have to!" "I know," he answers, before messing up your hair one last time. You scowl a little. "Iruka-senseeei!" He chuckles and fixes your hair for you.</P><P>"All done!" you exclaim, setting Naruto's mended vest neatly on your coffee table. You sigh and run a hand through your hair, really stressing out, even though you didn't have to. "And I need to get those tests graded tonight too... Aw, man..." True, tomorrow would be Saturday, but you liked having the weekend to have <I>fun.</I> No work allowed. You grab a red inked pen and start grading the tests. 'I'm going to do this! No matter how late I have to stay up!'<p></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P>Here is the next ch.</P><P>D.O.A just oc</P><P>You groan and put a hand to your head, then let out a soft sigh. Fell asleep on my floor again, didnt I? No, you fell asleep on your table. I moved you to the couch, Neji answers, smiling at you, and holding a cup of tea. You take the cup hes offering you and sigh again, then ask, "How do you always know when to come and when not to come, Neji?" He shrugs slightly. "Call it intuition. Then again, its not hard to believe that you fall asleep on your floor almost every night." You blush lightly, then take a sip of your tea. Youd always had a tendency to fall asleep on your floor because you were always up late and you were too lazy to get to your bed. Why did you even have a bed? "I should really work on that." "I think its cute when you fall asleep on the table or floor. You look so calm and comfy, I really hate to wake you up. Whoever you marry is going to be a lucky man, Kage." You blush even more and look up at him quickly, then cover your face with one hand. "Neji, youre embarrassing me! Why would anyone want to marry me?" "Why would anyone <I>not</I> want to marry you? Youre gorgeous, youre smart, and youre adorable. If I didnt already have someone to call my own, youd probably be my second choice."You glare at Neji slightly, then look away, not being able to calm your blush. "You're so embarrassing! I dont think Im pretty or smart at all! And how am I adorable, huh? I mean its not like I look like a kitten or something!" Neji crosses his arms and frowns at you, then rolls his eyes. "You dont <I>look</I> adorable, Kage. Youre too feminine and grown up for that. I mean youre adorable when you blush and accidentally make a fool out of yourself. Or when you hurry to apologize for something even if its not your fault. You just get so flustered, and the way you worry over people is just motherly. If anyone hated you, Id like to meet that person. And shake his hand."You stand up quickly, frowning. "Lots of people hate me!" He raises an eyebrow, then rests his fists on his hips and leans toward you slightly. "Name <I>three.</I>"You open your mouth, but nothing comes out. He smirks victoriously. "You cant even name one, can you? Its adorable when you argue about something, too." You blush, then grab your now empty cup and throw it at him. "Neji!" He ducks, causing the cup to hit the wall and bounce off, then picks it up and stands up straight, frowning at you. "Now what if that had been glass?" "Then Id be angry about how I missed! Youre such a jerk!" you answer, scowling at him. "You dont mean that. Im going to go see if I have any missions. <I>You</I> have to go meet Iruka at the Ichiraku." he states, walking toward the door. You blink, then gasp and look at the clock to see its nearly one oclock. 'Oh, hes been waiting for almost an hour!' "I-Ill see you later, Neji!" you exclaim, running past him. Arent you going to-? Lock your door, he murmurs, seeing that you werent going to hear him. Whoever marries you is going to be <I>very</I> lucky.</P><P>Naruto's POV::: You frown slightly, then look up at your former sensei. "Are you sure Kage is going to meet us, Iruka? ...I'm starting to get really hungry." Iruka frowns at you, then looks back in what you guessed was the direction of Kage's house. "You're always hungry. And yes, I'm <I>sure</I> Kage is going to meet us. She probably tried to pull an all-nighter again..." You frown. "...Why?" "Weekends are for fun. ...At least that's what she thinks. She's always staying up late." "Iruka-sensei!" You both turn to see Kage running toward you. When she gets to you, she stops and rests her hands on her knees, panting. "So... sorry... for being so late..." Iruka offers her a hand, which she takes, and helps her stand up straight. "It's okay, Kage. We've only been waiting a half an hour." "Aiyah! Was that supposed to make me feel better!" she asks, scowling. You smile slightly, then rest a hand on your shoulder. "Hey, no biggie. We haven't been waiting that long." She frowns, then sighs and looks down at her feet. "Alright... Hey, Iruka-sensei! Wanna have a ramen eating contest?" she asks suddenly, looking up at Iruka with glittering eyes. Iruka groans quietly, then shakes his head. "Kage, you <I>always</I> beat me. Let's just eat, not get sick, okay?" You laugh and rest your hands behind your head. "Yeah, you probably can't eat that much anyway!" Iruka slaps a hand to his forehead and shakes his head. "Oh, Naruto..." Kage scowls at you, then points in your face. "I bet I can eat more than you can!" You blink, then smirk. Hey, lots of ramen, and Iruka was paying? Bring it on. "If you think you can handle it, <I>Thumbelina.</I>" She growls, then shouts, "Bring it, blondie!"</P><P>Your POV::: You send Naruto a smirk as a bowl of ramen is set in front of you, then grab your chopsticks and start eating quickly. He's only a second behind you. Iruka sighs, frowning, then starts eating as well, muttering about how he'd hoped to just <I>talk</I> today, not watch two idiots stuff their faces. You eat about twelve bowls, then decide you should stop. You set your bowl down, then blink as you find Naruto staring at you with his mouth slightly hanging open. You blush lightly, then look down at your lap. 'There I go, embarrassing myself again... He's going to think I'm a pig...' you think, bringing a hand to your mouth. "That..." You blush even more and close your eyes. "...Was totally awesome! How can you <I>eat</I> like that? You're so <I>tiny!</I>" Naruto exclaims, grinning. You blink, then look up at him in confusion. "...What?" "That was totally awesome! I mean, seriously! How can you eat that much and not explode?" he asks, leaning his chin in his hand. You blush and rub the back of your head. "It's... not really all that much, actually..." "You should see her at festivals," Iruka states, then winces as you elbow him in the side. You scowl at him. "Iruka-sensei! Don't be so mean to me!" "I'm not being mean, I'm being truthful!" he answers, smiling at you, before messing up your hair. You squeek, then quickly fix your hair. "Nyeek! I said don't be so mean!" "So... Now that you've eaten half your fill... can I ask you something?" Iruka asks, watching as another bowl is set in front of you. Naruto blinks, then looks back at you. "Another bowl?" "Yes, I eat a lot! Please, Iruka-sensei, ask away," you answer, looking up at him. He sighs and rolls his eyes, then looks back at you. "Who's going to be your date to the Cherry Blossom Festival next week?" You blush and flinch slightly, then look back down at your food. "Um... It's... I-I don't really... Eh..." You blush even more as you stumble over your words, then cover your face. Naruto blinks at you, then looks at Iruka. "Translation?" "She doesn't have one," he answers, smiling a little at how you're reacting. Naruto looks back at you, then smiles. "Well, I'll go with you, Kage." You blink, then look up at him hopefully. "Really, Naruto-san?" He nods. "Yeah. As long as you promise to stop calling me by <I>-san</I> and just call me by Naruto," he answers, giving you a lopsided grin. You smile and nod, happy to have a date. You'd been going to the festival alone and meeting up with Iruka for years, just because no one would ever ask you to be their date. It... might be nice, not having to be seen with Iruka and being called his pity-girlfriend. Iruka smiles as well and sighs, then blinks as the bill is set down in front of him. "...Oh my God!" You flinch, then look up at him quickly. "Ah, Iruka-sensei! I'll help pay, I swear! It was my idea to have an eating contest, and-" "Oh, stop worrying for once," he answers, before shoving a chopstick full of ramen into your mouth. You blush lightly, then sigh and look down at your food. "Sorry..." "Eat or be silent." Naruto smiles again and leans his arms on the table. "Jeez, Kage. It's a free meal; let him pay." You nod slightly, still blushing. "Okay."<p></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><p><b>New Chapter and thanks Lorna Roxen</b></p><p><b>"And that's how attacking the vital organs can also damage the chakra flow. Would you like to add anything, Kage?" You sigh and continue looking at some of the tests you were correcting. "...Kage?" A small smile can be seen playing on your lips as you set a corrected paper on the corrected sack. "...Kage..." You begin correcting another paper. "...Kage!" You jump and look up to find Iruka frowning down at you, then lean around him slightly to see the class laughing in the background. You blush lightly and look back up at him. "Um... W-What was the question, Iruka-sensei?" Iruka sighs and shakes his head, then looks back at the class. "You have a ten minute break while Kage and I talk. The amount of time is subject to change if your behavior gets out of control." At this, the children immediately turn and start talking to each other quietly. Iruka looks back at you, concerned. "Are you okay, Kage? You've been out of it for the past few days." You blush a little more, then look down at the paper you're correcting and doodle a little stick figure doing a summoning jutsu. "Oh, I... I'm fine, sensei, it's just..." You add a little mouse to the drawing, to show it was the thing summoned, then look back up at him, eyes sparkling with something not even you could name. "I've just been so excited. I can't wait for the festival and have absolutely no idea what to do." "You could try paying attention," he suggests, then smiles and shakes his head. "Man... You're lucky we have tomorrow off to help set up for the festival. Otherwise, I'd ask you to take one of your sick days. Relax, Kage. You're going to have a great time with Naruto," he states, resting a hand on your shoulder. You smile back at him, then nod. "You're right. It's just the first time I've had a date, so I'm... kind of anxious." He waves it away. "It's really not that different from going on a regular date, Kage." You blink at him innocently, then repeat, "It's the first time I've had a date, Iruka-sensei." He blinks at you, then stands up straight, stunned. "<i>Ever?</i>" You blush and nod, going back to correcting the paper quickly. "Yes, and please don't rub it in!" "Who wouldn't want to go on a date with you? You're amazing!" he states loudly, making you blush even more and wince slightly. You both blink as the class goes silent. You look up as Iruka turns to see what's going on, only to find that the children are all staring at you. You gulp, then frown sternly. "Is there a reason you're all staring at me like I've grown another head?" "You've never had a <i>date,</i> Ryu-sensei?" one of the girls asks. You nod slightly. "Really? But you're so <i>hot!</i>" one of the boys exclaims, frowning. You blush and stand up, slamming your hands on the desk. "Let's <i>not</i> talk about my personal life and get back to charka flows <i>please!</i>" you exclaim, scowling, then walk around the desk and walk over to the chalkboard. You write down some terms, then turn toward the class, still scowling. "I'm going to lecture you and by the time I'm done, you better have these terms defined!" The class groans. You cross your arms, then roll your eyes. "I'm going to start now, so you better get your papers and pencils ready." They start rummaging around for the needed items slowly, grumbling to themselves. You scowl a little more, then start talking, loudly. "There are many chakra points, but few major ones that, if targeted directly, can result in death-" At this, the class starts scrambling, looking for paper and pencils before you can define one of the terms. Iruka smiles, then sits at the desk and carries on correcting where you left off.</b></p><p><b>"There. You're dismissed." You watch the class file out miserably, then smile and wave after them. "Don't forget to come to the festival!" Iruka chuckles and walks up beside you. "You handled that well." "Oh, don't you go making fun of me too!" you answer, turning toward him and putting your hands on your hips. He holds his hands up quickly. "Hey! I did nothing!" You frown at him, then cross your arms and stick your nose up in the air. "Humph!" You open one eye to see his expression, then giggle to yourself and cover your mouth as he starts chuckling. "You don't have a prissy bone in your body, Kage." You nod slightly. "You're right!" "Kage!" You turn quickly to find Kakashi standing in the doorway. You frown slightly. "What's wrong, Kakashi-san? Is someone hurt?" "No, but Naruto's going to be if you can't get his vest to him in time," he answers. You blink, then gasp and cover your mouth. "Oh, he said he'd come and get it! Where is he?" "They're at the temple!" You nod and run out of the school, somewhat annoyed yet somewhat worried. Naruto had said he'd come pick up his vest, but maybe he was too busy? You run to your house and grab the vest, then run to the temple, where you hear some loud shouting. "It's not <i>my</i> fault!" "How do you lose your vest if you're supposed to be wearing it without it being your fault! There's no way!" You look around for the source of the voices, then run into the temple see Naruto being chewed out by a girl who looked to be one of his students. You run up to him quickly, then hold his vest out to him, panting a little. "Na- Naruto-san!" He looks at you quickly, then grins and takes his vest. You rest your hands on your knees and pant a few more seconds, then stand up straight and frown at him. "I thought you said you'd come pick it up!" He blinks at you innocently, then asks, "I did?" You stare at him, then throw your hands up in frustration. "Ugh! I work my butt off mending that for you and even bring it to you when Kakashi says you're being chewed out and you can't even give me a decent excuse?" He rubs the back of his head, then looks down at his feet. "Um... Thanks. ...For everything." You let your arms drop to your sides, then smile at him a little. "You're welcome. Next time, just... remember to pick it up." He nods and smiles sheepishly. "Okay." You clasp your hands behind your back, then look at his students, who are staring at you. You blink at them, then frown at Ina. "Ina-chan, you shouldn't scold your sensei like that!" She winces and rubs the back of her head sheepishly. "Eh, gomen, Kage. I'll try not to." You blink at her, then smile and shake your head. "No, you won't, Ina-chan. Don't lie. So, Naruto-san, I'll see you tomorrow, right?" He smiles at you, then answers, "Only if you start calling me Naruto." You blush lightly and sweatdrop. "Eh heh heh..." "Wait, you're going with Naruto-sensei? Ew!" Ina exclaims, sticking her tongue out. Naruto scowls at her. "Hey!" "Well why are <i>you</i> going out with someone who's so much better than you?" she asks, scowling at him. You frown and wave your hands for her to stop. "Ina-chan! Don't be so mean!" She frowns at you, then sighs and rolls her eyes. "Oi... You know he's going to amount to nothing, right?" she asks, pointing at Naruto. Naruto growls. "I'm going to be the next Hokage, believe it!" "Yeah right! A billy goat will become Hokage before you do!" The two glare at each other. You flinch slightly and bite your index finger slightly, then smile and clasp your hands behind your back. "I believe it." Both turn to look at you. "Huh?" You look at Naruto and repeat, "I believe it." He stares at you for a few seconds, confused, then grins. "Thanks, Kage! You're the best, believe it!" You laugh and rub the back of your head. "I don't know if I can believe that, Naruto. ...Well, I better go. See you tomorrow." You wave slightly, then turn and start to leave.</b></p><p><b>Naruto's POV::: You watch Kage start to leave, then wince as you're elbowed in the side by Ina. "Tell her when you're going to pick her up, stupid!" she mutters, sending a glare at you. You rub your side, thinking quickly, then call out, "I'll pick you up at five, okay?" Kage looks back at you in surprise, then smiles and nods. "Alright, I'll be expecting you." You watch her walk away, then turn and glare down at Ina. "What the hell was that for?" She scowls at you. "If you're going to take my cousin to the festival, you're going to treat her right!" Your eye twitches slightly. 'That's... why she didn't use -san...' "I'm gonna teach you how to treat my cousin if it's the last thing I do! ...Well, it probably will be, your stupidity will kill me... But anyway! Get ready to have some manners whipped into you!" she exclaims, pointing at you. You twitch slightly in annoyance. "...You... will kill me..."</b></p>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>Two in one day<p></P><P>You jump as you hear someone knock on your door, then hurry to finish your hair. 'Dang it, dang it, dang it! I knew I should have started getting ready earlier!' "Just a second, just a second! Please don't leave!" you call out, then check your hair carefully before running for the door. You open it quickly, then smile as you find Naruto standing there, looking very handsome in his nice clothes. He blushes and rubs the back of his head. "Sorry I'm late, Kage. I just lost track of the time, and-" "Oh, don't worry about it!" you exclaim, blushing. "I just finished getting ready myself." He blinks at you, then suddenly holds out a white carnation. "Here. This is for you. Ina-chan said you liked them." You blush a little more and take it, then look up at him and smile like ^-^. "Right, they're my favorite!" He smiles slightly. "Right..." You smell the carnation and sigh, then look back up at him, tucking the carnation into your bun. "So... shall we go then?" He shakes off whatever daze he's in, then holds his arm out. "Yeah. Let's go." You blush, then slip your arm into his and close your door. "...You gonna lock it?" he asks, raising an eyebrow. You smile and shake your head. "I never do. It's just never really been a habit." "...That's going to get dangerous one of these days, believe it," he states, rolling his eyes. You look down at your feet. "Well, one of those days hasn't happened yet, and I'm an optimist." "Right."</P><P>You sigh and rest your chin on your stuffed animal happily. "This was fun, Naruto. Thanks for bringing me." Naruto leans his arms on the bar and nods, looking out over the village. "It was fun, wasn't it?" You look down at the ground far below, for once enjoying the ferris wheel, then look back at him, smiling. "Yeah." He looks at you and licks his lips, then quickly looks back down. "So, uh... do you really like that stupid stuffed animal I got you?" he asks, rubbing the back of his head nervously. You look at the stuffed animal fox that Naruto had won for you, then smile and rest your chin on it again. "Of course I like it, Naruto. It's adorable." "You sure?" You turn toward him and give him a quick peck on the cheek, then look back at the ground, resting your chin back on the stuffed fox and blushing lightly. "I'm sure." Naruto's eyes widen slightly as he feels heat rising to his cheeks, before he slowly turns his gaze on you. You blush a little more and close your eyes tightly. 'Oh crap, I didn't mean to do that!' You blush a little more as he grabs your chin, then gasp and open your eyes as you feel his soft lips press against yours. He wraps an arm around your waist and pulls you a little closer, then raises a hand and strokes your cheek gently. You stare at him for a few seconds, then sigh and close your eyes, leaning into the kiss. He kisses you for a few more seconds, then breaks the kiss and opens his eyes to see your reaction. You keep your eyes closed and touch your lips cautiously, as if afraid the feeling will disappear, then slowly look up at him. "I..." He sighs and looks away, fearing that you didn't like it and wouldn't see him like that. You hesitate before grabbing his arm and leaning up, gently placing another kiss on his lips. He blinks in surprise, then smiles and wraps his arms around you again. You moan softly as he licks your bottom lip. "Mm..." He brushes his tongue against your lips again, then reaches down and brushes his hand against your side. You giggle softly, because it tickles, then gasp as Naruto thrusts his tongue into your mouth while he has the chance. He explores your mouth curiously, then suddenly starts nibbling on your bottom lip. You blush a little and open your eyes. He bites your bottom lip gently, then sucks it into his mouth and pulls a little. You groan softly and grab his shoulders. He releases your lip and leans back a little, also blushing lightly. You pull away from him and fiddle with your fox nervously. Naruto rubs the back of his head, then says, "Sorry, if that was too fast... I mean, usually I don't..." "It was fine, Naurto, I... ...I liked it..." you answer softly, blushing a little more. He looks at you in surprise, then smiles and looks back down at the ground. "I'll keep that in mind."</P><P>You smile as Naruto walks you up to your door, then turn toward him and tilt your head innocently. "Thank you for taking me to the festival, Naruto. It means a lot to me." "Hey, no problem!" he answers, then grabs your chin and gives you a quick peck on the lips. You blush and touch your lips, then quickly look down. "I'll see you later, believe it!" he whispers, then kisses your ear softly. You shiver and look up at him quickly, then nod. "I believe it." He tucks your hair behind your ear, then brushes his hand against your cheek before pulling away. "You better get some sleep. <I>Tonight</I> isn't the night to pull an all-nighter. ...Okay?" You nod again. "Okay, Naruto. Goodnight." "'Night," he answers, then turns and starts walking toward his apartment. You watch him until he's out of sight, then walk into your house, pulling the carnation out of your hair to put it in a glass of water. You gasp as someone claps a hand over your mouth and drop the carnation, then start struggling wildly. "Mmph! Gmm mph!" You grab a kunai from your attacker's belt and stab him in the arm, then spin around only to be faced with about seven shuriken. You dodge some of them, but the rest end up cutting you. You hiss and go to try and stab him again, but he has a kunai out and is ready for you. He blacks your attack with one kunai, then stabs you in the side with another one. You wince, then kick him in the face. He recovers quickly and uses his other kunai to stab you in the arm. You yelp and grab your arm, then gasp as he suddenly shoves you up against the wall. He punches you in the face, then throws you over his shoulder and walks toward your bedroom. You growl and start kicking, but it doesn't seem to have much effect. "Let go of me, you ass hole! Let go!" He throws you onto your bed, then climbs on top of you quickly. You start to scream when you suddenly realize where he was going with this, but he crushes your mouth with his to muffle it. You grab his shoulders and try to push him away. "Gmf!" He grabs your wrists and pins them above your head, then grabs two kunai and stabs them through your palms, pinning them to the headboard. You whimper softly in pain. He breaks the kiss and gags you quickly, while your mind is dazed with pain, then starts ripping off your kimono. You whimper again, then wince as he smirks slightly and grabs a shuriken and carves three lines onto your cheeks, just like Naruto's. You sob quietly, tears dripping into your cuts.<p></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>Here it is hope you people like it.</P><P>Neji's POV::: You walk into Kage's house and sigh, annoyed that she had again refused to lock her door, then frown as you see blood splattered on the wall. "...Kage?" You take a few steps in, then look down quickly as you step on something. 'A carnation...?' You pick it up, then frown as you see more blood staining its delicate petals. "...Kage..." You hear a soft noise from her room and grab a kunai quickly, then walk toward the door. You grab the doorknob, then open the door quickly, holding the kunai up. Your eyes widen as you find Kage laying on the bed, stripped naked and cut up. You rush over to her. "Kage!" She looks up at you quickly, then sobs and, raising her arms slightly, whispers, "Take them out...! Take them out!" You look up at her hands in confusion, then quickly grab the kunai holding them up and yank them out. She brings her arms and covers her chest weakly. "N-Neji..." You frown, then grab a blanket and wrap her in it. She lays her head on your chest and whimpers softly as you pick her up bridal style. "Neji... Ak..." You start running toward the hospital. "Don't talk, Kage." "...Akat...suki..." she whispers weakly, closing her eyes. You scowl slightly and run into the hospital. "I'll tell the hokage." "Akat... Akatsuki... Stop... Naruto..." You look down at her in confusion. She looks up at you again, tears starting to run from her eyes once more. "Akatsuki... want... Naruto... Stop... Akatsuki..."</P><P>Naruto's POV::: You tap your foot against the ground and sigh in annoyance. "If she complains about <I>me</I> being late, why in the world is she taking an hour to get here?" you complain, wondering what in the world could make Ina late for your post-festival meeting. "Naurto-sensei!" You turn, finally relieved that Ina had arrived, then blink as she suddenly runs to you and hugs you tightly, sobbing. You rub the back of your head nervously, then grab her shoulder. "Ina-chan, what's wrong? Why are you crying?" She cries a few more minutes, then looks up at you and sobs out, "Kage's in the h-hospital!" Your eyes widen slightly. "W-what? Why?" She sobs again, then answers, "I d-don't know! T-they won't let m-me in to see heeer!" You scowl, then grab her hand and stalk toward the hospital. "We'll see about that." You walk into the hospital, look around quickly, then walk up to the desk and slam your hand down on what the nurse was doing. She looks up at you quickly. You glare at her slightly, then ask, "Where's Kage's room?" She gulps slightly, then shakes her head. "I'm sorry, sir, but she's asked for no one to visit her." "I don't give a damn if she asked for the hokage to dye her hair green! I want to see her! Believe it!" you shout, making everyone turn toward you. The nurse starts shaking a bit, but won't back down. "I'm sorry." You let out an animal-like snarl. "N-Naruto-kun, over here." You turn quickly, then relax slightly as you see Hinata standing behind you. "What is it, Hinata?" "I-I can take you to Kage's room, but... she won't be happy about it," she states softly, blushing. You nod quickly. "I want to see her." She nods slightly, then leads you toward the room Kage's in. You follow her. She stops at a large window, right next to Neji, then motions toward it. You turn to look through the window, then gasp as you see Kage's horrible state. "Oh my God..." Ina frowns and tries to look as well, but you quickly get in front of her. "No, Ina. ...Not yet." Ina scowls at you. "She's <I>my</I> cousin, sensei! I should be able to see her!" "...Not like this," you order softly. Her scowl slowly melts into a concerned frown. "But when?" "...I'll let you know," you answer, then turn and push her toward the stairs. "Go tell the others that you get the day off." "But-" "Go." She looks up at you and bites her bottom lip, then turns and sprints away. You watch her until she's out of sight, then look back at Kage. Hinata looks up at you, then bows slightly. "I need to go. I've healed her all that I can physically, but mentally... there's nothing I can do for her." You nod slightly. "Thanks, Hinata." She nods back at you, then turns to leave. You sigh and watch Kage silently for a few minutes, before Neji suddenly states, "It happened last night." You look at him quickly. He keeps his eyes on Kage but continues talking. "I found her this morning. She was beaten badly and raped. Narturally, I brought her here. On the way here, however, she told me that the Akatsuki had done this to her." You stiffen, then growl softly. Neji looks at you sternly. "Don't go after them for revenge, Naruto. That's exactly what they want. They attacked Kage so that they'd anger you, and make you want revenge. What you can do to spite them is to wait here, until the opportunity comes where you can finally return the damage they did to her." You growl, then sigh and look back at Kage. "She didn't deserve this." "Does anyone <I>ever</I> deserve it? No. But I can promise you that it doesn't bother her as much as it bothers any of us. That's why she makes such a great ninja. She takes things in stride. To her, this is just a learning experience. Nothing traumatizing, nothing wrong. Get over it and treat her the way she wants to be treated. Like a regular, healthy person. Not a wounded ninja." You growl again, then look down at your feet, balling your hands into tight fists. "...Fine. I will for her. Believ it." He smiles slightly, then nods at you. "She really cares about you, you know." You blush lightly and look back up at him. "She hasn't even known me two weeks!" "Does it even take two minutes for a woman to decide if she cares about something? No. It only takes two <I>seconds,</I> if that. Oh..." He turns his gaze back into the room. "Her flower, it... I think you should get her a new one." You follow his gaze to the bedside table, where you see the carnation you gave to her sitting in a small vase of water. The only thing different was that its petals were stained with what must have been her blood. You nod slightly. "Alright."</P><P>Your POV::: You groan slightly and open your eyes, body aching like no tomorrow. 'I don't even remember coming back from a <I>mission</I> this bad...' You turn onto your side and sigh, then blink as you see a carnation in a vase next to your bed. You reach out and touch its petals gently, smiling. 'It's the same one Naruto gave me. A little bloody, but... that just makes it all the more beautiful.' You flinch slightly as you hear the door open, then sit up and turn toward it. You scowl slightly as you see Naruto looking at you, then state, "I asked for no visitors." He blinks at you, then smiles innocently and walks over to you. "True, but you don't always get what you ask for." "Well I think that I should at <I>least</I> get <I>this</I> wish-" you start, only to cut yourself off as you find him waving another white carnation in front of your face. "...What's this for?" He smiles again. "Your other one has blood all over it. I figured you might like this one better." You take it and can't help but blush lightly. "Well, thank you, but... I still like the bloody one better..." Naruto blinks at you, then, ever the blunt one, asks, "Why?" You turn and stick it in the vase with the other one. "It just... looks prettier. I mean, have you ever seen a flower more unique? ...And such a vibrant shade of red, too. I've always thought that white was such a <I>pure</I> color. The red blood just somehow... fits." He tilts his head slightly and walks over to them, then nods a little. "I guess I see what you're saying." You smile at him, then blink as he takes out a kunai. "What are you going to do with that? <I>OhmiGod!</I> What are you doing?" you ask quickly, trying to stop him from cutting his fingers. He does so anyway, then holds them above the clean flower and lets some of his blood drip onto it. You blush and hold a hand to your mouth. Once he figures that the carnation has enough blood on it, he pulls his hand back and licks the cuts gently. You gulp, then whisper, "Why'd you do that?" He looks at you in surprise, then smiles. "Well, the first one has <I>your</I> blood on it, and you liked it so much, that... I figured I'd do the same thing to the other one with <I>my</I> blood," he answers, then suddenly reaches out and grabs your chin. You blush as he studies your face carefully, then close your eyes tightly as he leans toward you. He leans down and kisses each of the six fully healed cuts on your face, then plants a firm kiss on your lips. You moan slightly, then look up at him as he breaks the kiss and blush a little more. He smiles at you like ^-^. "You look cute like this, believe it." You look away quickly and frown. Naruto looks you over carefully, then suddenly frowns and moves your hair away from your neck. You squeek and clap your hand down on your hair, once again covering your neck. He scowls and moves your hand away. "Wait a second." You wince slightly as he looks at your neck, then traces the long, jagged scar down your ear to your shoulder. He frowns and looks back up at you. "How far down does it go?" You sigh slightly, then rest your hand against your hip. "Here." "Why?" You bite your bottom lip, then answer, "Chuunin go on dangerous missions as well, Naruto." "One of which is teaching a classroom full of students," he states, making you laugh. "Yes, maybe." He gives you one last kiss, then looks at the door. "I have to go now, Kage. I'll come visit later." You nod slightly. "Okay."<p></P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>this chapter has a lemon if you don't like don't read</P><P>You sigh and shake your head, then look up at Iruka as the class files out and frown. "Do I really teach that differently now that I'm back?" He frowns and nods. "Yes. You're a lot nicer. ...A bit spacier, but nicer." You sigh again and look down at your feet. "I can't help it. I'm just so worried about Naruto... He's been missing for days, and he was acting funny right before he left..." "I am too, Kage. They've got tracker-nin after him now, though," Iruka states, trying to make both you and himself feel better. You shake your head quickly, trying to shake off the need to cry as well, then look back up at him. "He's one of the most skilled jounin ever, sensei. He could hide his trail easily." "I'm trying not to think about that. Maybe all we need is a weekend." You nod slightly, sighing. "Yeah. That's all I want to <I>do</I> this weekend. <I>Sleep.</I>" "That sounds good. I'll see you on monday, Kage." You smile at him and nod, gathering the tests you'd correct later. "Bye, Iruka-sensei." You walk home and sigh, then open your door. You listen intently, then walk inside. 'I can't believe I still don't like to lock my door,' you think, smiling a little bit, then walk into the kitchen and set the papers on the table. You blink as you see a vase of bloody carnations on the table, then gasp and take a step back instinctively. 'Only Naruto knows that I like these!' You bite your bottom lip, then look around nervously before taking a step toward the flowers and smelling them. "Mm..." You lean back and start counting them. "...Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven-" <I>"Twelve."</I>" You gasp and spin around quickly to find Naruto leaning in the doorway. He walks toward you slowly. You back up a little, not noticing that his eyes had changed to red and his pupils were no longer human, but demonic, then squeek and look behind you as you feel the table dig into your back. You look up again as Naruto rests his hands on either side of you and pins you between the table and himself, then blush and bite your bottom lip. He leans down and kisses your neck softly. You shiver and moan softly, then shake your head and try to push him away. "Everyone's looking for you, Naruto! Where did you go?" He leans his mouth next to your ear and hisses softly. <I>"Getting revenge."</I> You gasp quietly, then groan as he pushes his body up against yours. "Oh..." He bites your ear gently, sucks on it, then reaches up and grabs your shirt roughly. You gasp again, then try to push him away again. "No! Naruto, you need to go see Tsunade-sama! Please!" you beg, looking up at him. He growls angrily, then grabs your arm and turns, dragging you toward your room. You blush and try to pull away, not wanting to hurt him, then bite your bottom lip. 'I don't want to hurt you, Naruto, but you're not giving me a choice!' You grab a kunai and try to stab him in the shoulder, but he spins around and grabs your wrist, slamming you up against the wall. You gasp in pain, dropping the kunai quickly in hopes that he'll release your wrist, then wince slightly as he glares at you, finally noticing his eyes. "K... Kyuubi?" He smirks slightly, then whispers, <I>"The boy can't see that he needs to claim you if he wants to keep you, just like he couldn't see that he had to kill the man who stole you from him. I made him realize he needed revenge and I'll make him realize that he needs to claim you."</I> You smile nervously and blush, then exclaim, "K-Kyuubi-sama, he doesn't need to worry about that! I'd never do that to him! He means too much to me!" He growls slightly, baring elongated canine teeth at you. <I>"All pitiful lies to try and get out of this. It won't hurt long, and he'll be gentle. ...Gentler than the man that fucked you the first time, anyway..."</I> You gulp, staring at his teeth, then look up at him quickly. "Kyuubi-sama, I..." He leans closer and sucks on your ear slightly, then whispers, <I>"You want this, don't you, wench? You want him to claim you anyway he wants as long as you get his huge dick up your soft, tight pussy? You want him to ram into your unexperienced body and make you cum like the little bitch you are?"</I> You gulp again, then close your eyes tightly, breath quickening a little bit. Kyuubi pushes his host's body up against yours. <I>"You want to feel his teeth against the soft skin of your breasts? You want him to tease you, torture you, make you writhe and beg for more?"</I> You shiver and tilt your head back a little. "K-Kyuubi-sama... Please..." He growls, then slowly raises his voice. <I>"You want him to hold you down and fuck you so hard you bleed? You want him to find your g-spot and pound it until you pass out? Tell him that, wench! Tell him and pleasure him like the little tramp you are!"</I> You groan as he sucks at the base of your throat, then wrap your arms around his neck and tangle your fingers in his hair. "Naruto..." <I>"The boy wants to fuck you just as much as you want him to, wench. Are you sure you can handle him?"</I> You shake your head a little and hook one of your legs over his hip, pulling his body closer to yours. "No... I..." <I>"God... Your body is so hot..."</I> he groans, then wraps his arms around your waist and grinds against you. You start panting and push your chest closer to his. "N-Naruto...!" <I>"He can't hear you, wench. You're going to have to scream for him to make me believe I should let him out to claim you,"</I> Kyuubi states, then rams his hips into yours, making you whimper softly. "Naruto... Ah...!" <I>"Scream for him, wench!"</I> "N-Naruto! Naruto!" Kyuubi watches you carefully, then suddenly lunges up and bites your ear gently. You shiver and pull him closer. "<I>Naruto!</I> Ngh... Naruto, fuck me!" He turns his head toward you, then smirks. <I>"Scream again, wench."</I> You groan, not noticing the changing of his eyes, then scream, "Stop teasing me and fuck me, Naruto!" Naruto glances at you in surprise, then stops moving, confused. You whimper softly and try to pull him closer to you with your leg. "No... Naruto, don't stop... Please...!" He hesitates, then starts grinding against you again. You moan and tilt your head back. "Narutooo!" He gulps, then starts sucking on your neck, starting to grind against you faster. You gasp softly. "Naruto!" He begins breathing harder and moves his lips down your neck, then lifts you up and carries you toward your room. You wrap your legs around his waist and groan softly. "Naruto..." He lays you on your bed, then strips you quickly, leaving you in just your panties on the sheets. You sigh and turn your head slightly, enjoying the cool fabric brushing against your fevered skin, then gasp and look up quickly as he starts rubbing the entrence to your pussy. He smirks at you and rubs a little harder. You gulp and grab the sheets tightly. "N-Naruto... Oh... Naruto...!" He slips his fingers under your panties and fingers you slightly, then leans down and starts planting kisses over your warm skin. You whimper softly. "God... What did Kyuubi say to you to make you so wet...?" Naruto asks softly, before pulling your panties off and throwing them to the side. You pant quietly, then whisper, "Nothing... a perverted fox demon wouldn't say..." He leans over you and starts kissing your neck and jaw softly, then murmurs, "So having someone saying dirty things in your ear can get you wet? You're just a little bitch, aren't you? Are you sure you want me to be your stud?" You nod quickly. "Yes! Yes, Naruto, please!" He sits up and throws his vest and shirt to the side, then starts taking off his pants. You study his face carefully. There was something... <I>off</I> about it. "...Naruto..." He looks down at you quickly. You gasp as you see his pupils slowly change to slits, then whimper in pain as he shoves his cock up your pussy quickly. "Agh!" He wraps his arms around your waist tightly and starts thrusting in and out of you quickly. You groan softly as he slowly goes deeper and deeper into you, then whimper again. "Ooh... Naruto... God... It's so long...!" He growls softly, then murmurs, "You know... I could go deeper..." You gasp as he rams a little harder, then grab his shoulders. "Naruto!" "Kage... Wrap your legs around me..." You gulp, then wrap your legs around him. He goes at the same pace for a few more seconds, then suddenly starts slamming his cock up your pussy faster and harder. You gasp and throw your head back slightly. "Oh my God!" He chuckles and nuzzles your neck. You gulp, then whimper softly as he goes a little bit deeper. "Ooh, Naruto...!" He bites your collarbone sharply. You wince, then whimper softly. "Ouch!" "Just a second, just a second... I almost found it," Naruto whispers, then goes still deeper. You gasp and throw your head back again. "God! Oh, Naruto! Right there! Right there! Uhn...! God, right there...!" you exclaim, pulling him closer. He chuckles and kisses your shoulder. "Mm... You're so tight... It's like you're swallowing my dick every time..." You groan and tighten your grip on him, digging your nails into his shoulders slightly. "Oh... Ooh, ooh! God, Naruto!" "Are you almost ready to cum?" You nod quickly. "Yes... Naruto... Naruto...! Oh, stop!" He growls slightly and sends a small glare at you, then starts ramming into you faster. You scream and throw your head back quickly. "Aaah! Naruto! Oh, Naruto! Not so fast-!" You bite your bottom lip and whimper slightly. "Why? Does it hurt?" he asks angrily, holding you tighter. You shake your head quickly. "Too fast... Too fast, Naruto...!" "What's wrong with the speed?" You bite your bottom lip, then dig your nails into his shoulders slightly. "It feels so good... Uhn... God, no...!" He rams into you a little bit harder. You groan, then scream as your pussy tightens around his cock. "Naruto!" He rams into you a few more times, then grunts and spills his seed inside of you. You gasp as he collapses on top of you, then hug him tightly. "Naruto... God, that was so good..." "It helps when you have a horny fox demon sealed inside of you," he mutters, sitting up. You tilt your head slightly, frowning, then whisper, "Why?" Naruto brushes your hair out of your face and traces your scar all the way down to your hip, then glances back up at you. "Because not only do I have to fuck you hard enough for <I>me</I> to cum, but I have to do it hard enough to pleasure Kyuubi too." You shiver slightly, then close your eyes quickly. "So... Kyuubi was fucking me too...?" He shrugs slightly. "Sort of. ...But you have to admit... it was good..." You blush, then whimper as he starts to pull his cock out of you. "Please don't!" He looks up at you in surprise, then smiles and nods a little. "Okay." He turns so you're both laying on your sides, then pulls the blankets up. You snuggle up to him and sigh quietly. "Mm... And to think all I wanted to do as soon as I got home was sleep the whole weekend..." Naruto kisses your forehead, then smiles a little. "Oh, you can sleep. ...I'll fuck a few more times, but you can sleep." You giggle softly, then look up at him lovingly. "That sounds good. ... we can go out for ramen tomorrow..." "I'm paying," he states, and the way he says it informs you that there's no room for argument. You sigh, then nod. "Okay."<p></P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>Last chapter I hope who ever read this likes it and if any one wants a lemon just tell me the name, age, what you look like, and the guy.</P><P>You sigh and gaze out the window, then frown and turn to look at Naruto. "Naruto, you said you'd get off early today..." Naruto growls and runs a hand through his hair anxiously, then turns a sharp glare on you. "Kage, I told you I might have a meeting with Gaara today. Don't even bother waiting around, okay? He'll be here in about ten minutes and I still have a whole stack of papers to go through!" he exclaims angrily. You wince slightly, then look down at your feet. "...Okay..." You turn and walk toward the window. He glances at you, then suddenly looks back up at you and snaps, "Not out the window! Are you crazy? You'll hurt yourself!" You scowl at him, then sigh and turn toward the door. "Fine..." You open the door and walk out, then squeek as you accidentally bump into someone. You look up, then blush lightly as you see a man with red hair, seafoam green eyes, and a tattoo of the kanji 'love' on his forehead. "Oh, excuse me." You look back down at your feet and walk past him, then sigh and cross your arms, gazing at your stomach. 'Ever since Naruto became Hokage, he's been so irritable... I don't want this baby to grow up with him like this...' You sigh and walk out of the Hokage's office, then look up as you hear, "Kage, wait up!" You turn slightly, then smile as Ina runs up to you. "Hey, Ina." She smiles at you innocently, then clasps her hands behind her back. "How are you?" You shrug slightly. "Oh, same old." "And how's the baaaby?" she asks, leaning toward you slightly. "Oh, still kicking." "That's good. Hey, I have the afternoon off. You wanna go catch some ramen?" You open your mouth to answer that no, you should go wait at home for Naruto, but a voice behind you answers, "She'd love to." You squeek and look up quickly. Neji smiles at you. "Go, Kage. Naruto's going to be talking to Gaara for a while." You hesitate, then smile and nod. "You're right. Okay, Neji." He tucks your hair behind your ear, then strokes your cheek gently. "Have fun." You nod again. "Okay."</P><P>Neji's POV::: You watch Kage and her cousin walk away, then scowl and walk into the office building. 'Naruto has no right to treat Kage like that...' You stalk into his office angrily, slamming the door against the wall. Naruto and Gaara look up at you quickly. You walk to the desk and rest your hands on it, then lean toward Naruto so you're dangerously close to his face. "If you keep treating <I>your</I> wife, who's carrying <I>your</I> baby, the way you are, I will make her come live with me and I will make sure you <I>never</I> see your baby to treat it like you're treating Kage." Naruto stares at you in surprise, then stands up angrily. "What the hell are you talking about?" "You're treating Kage like <I>crap</I> and I'm not going to let it happen anymore! What the hell is wrong with you, Naruto? Didn't you see how hurt she was?" you ask, frowning. He stares at you, still trying to seem angry, then sits down and covers his face. "I can't do this anymore...!" Gaara frowns, then leans forward and rests his arms on the desk. "If you're going between a family and work, you must be stressed twenty-four seven. If she's willing to put up with it and not bother about it, you need to hold onto her. She's going to be the only thing that makes all of the stress bearable." You nod slightly. "He's right. Because I know you love her, and I know that if she leaves you, you'll never make it." Naruto looks up at you weakly, then turns his gaze on Gaara. "Uhm, Gaara... If we could continue this tomorrow?" "For the love of God, go."</P><P>Your POV::: You wave at Ina and smile. "Thanks for the ramen, Ina! My treat next time, okay?" She waves at you, then turns and starts walking home. You sigh, then turn and walk into the house, resting a hand on your stomach. "Well, little person, I guess it's just you and me." You walk into the kitchen, wondering what kind of ramen you should make for Naruto to take to him, then gasp in surprise as you see him sitting at the table. He looks up at you and tilts his head slightly, then looks back at the vase of white carnations in front of them, watching some blood drip from the end of his fingers. You gasp again, then walk toward him quickly. "Naruto, what are you doing? Stop that!" You grab his hand to stop him from bleeding himself dry, then sit down in the chair next to him and lick the cuts gently. He watches you for a few seconds, then whispers, "I'm sorry." You frown and look up at him. "For what?" "For treating you the way I have. You deserve better." You blush and look down at his hand, then whisper, "I... never really expected an apology. You're always so stressed, I... I was never unhappy..." He frowns, then grabs the back of your head and pulls you into a searing kiss. "Mm!" You rest your hands on his shoulder, then sigh. He breaks the kiss. "I love you, Kage." You blush a little and look away. "...I love you too, Naruto..."<p></P>
