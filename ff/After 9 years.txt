Naruto.</B></P><P><B>Enjoy!</B></P><P>A man and women
appeared in front of the north gate of Kohona.</P><P>The man wore red
bandages around his chest to the top of his navel with a black vest
over them. He had on regular black pants that any ninja would wear
and the regular shoes too, but they were red. On the back of his vest
he had a swirl stating one of his clans. He had a five foot length,
13 inch wide sword strapped to his back. On the sword was a blue nine
tailed fox that glowed red. He had two kunai pouches. One shuriken
pouch. He also had others, but I won't go into those now.</P><P>He had blond hair with
blue highlights, blue eyes that had red around the edges and around
his slit (like a cat) pupil. He had three whisker marks on each
cheek, he also had claw like nails along with canine sharp teeth.</P><P>The woman's top was a
piece of cloth that went across her shoulder and rapped around the
other side of her chest. It was pulled together and tied with a
casual obi or sash right above her navel. She had a belt that was
snug on her right hip that went down to about the middle of her
thigh. From the center to around the right hip, and stopped in thee
center of her left hip, a piece of fabric hung. It ended 5 inches
below her knee. The only thing you could see on her left side was
from the top of her hip the center of her thigh were red bandages,
along with a knife strapped to her thigh. Instead of regular shoes
she had four inch high heel boots. She also had a sword but it was
tied on her right hip. She had two kunai and one shuriken pouches.</P><P>She had fire red hair
that was held together with a fire and water chopsticks (one
symbolize fire the other water), the rest of her hair came out the
center of the bun and went down her back and stopped at the middle of
her back. She had red eyes with a slit pupil. She also had claws and
sharp canine teeth. She had red eye shadow and red lip gloss on.</P><P>The woman looked at the
man and said</P><P>"You ready?"</P><P>"Yup. Let's go."
The man replied and they walked through the gates undetected. As they
walked towards the Hokage tower everyone stopped what they were doing
and watched them in shock.</P><P>"They act like they
have never seen new comers." The woman said. The man laughed. It
was a low laugh that made the all women blush.</P><P>"How does it feel to
be back home?" the woman asked. The man scowled and said</P><P>"Nauseating." The
woman laughed. This time the men looked. Then the man put his arm
around the woman's waist as a group of kids came towards them.
Right before the group got to them they disappeared in a swirl of
water and fire. Then one of the kids in the group said</P><P>"Who we're they?"</P><P>"I don't know."
The girl with pink hair answered. Then the group went towards the
academy getting ready for their test.</P><P>The third was reading
his Ica Ica Paradise book when a swirl of water and fire appeared in
front of his desk. When the water and fire disappeared there stood a
man and woman. He put his book away and looked at the two. Then a man
with a scar walked into the room and shut the door then he realized
he and the Hokage weren't the only one's there.</P><P>"Who are you?" the
third asked them. The man looked at the Hokage. Then said</P><P>"Did you really
forget me old man?" the third's and Iruka's eyes widened. And
the man smirked.</P><P>"N-Naruto?!" they
both said. The man now known as Naruto smiled a foxy grin and said</P><P>"The one and only."
The third smiled and got up and went up to the boy and hugged him.
When he was done he went back to his desk and Iruka went up to Naruto
and hugged him.</P><P>"I missed you." He
said. Naruto smiled and hugged him back, a little too hard.</P><P>"C-can't breathe."
Naruto let go.</P><P>"I missed you too
Iruka- sensei. Sorry about that." He laughed. The girl smiled.</P><P>"He forgets how
strong he is sometimes." She said as she giggled. The third and
Iruka looked at her and raised eyebrows.</P><P>"O I forgot! This is
Kyuu-chan, she's my girlfriend." The third and Iruka smiled.</P><P>"Congratulations."
They said witch made the couple blush. They all laughed.</P><P>"Where have you been
Naruto? And why did you leave?" Then Naruto's face darkened.</P><P>"Training. I was
almost killed." The third frowned.</P><P>"Explain." He said.</P><P>"When I was 5 I was
playing in the play ground and a bunch of villagers came and attacked
me. When I was on the brink of death they threw me out side they
gates. When they we're done they left me there and I fell
unconscious.</P><P>While I was unconscious
I found my self in front of a huge cage. That was when I found out
about the nine tailed fox being sealed in me." The third and Iruka
paled. "When I came back it turns out that Kisame Hoshigaki saved
me from death.</P><P>"He also was the
first one to train me, he trained me in water jutsus, and he taught
me swordsmanship. I met a few other missing nin who taught me stuff
too. Then Kyuubi taught me some stuff also. Anyways I have been
training since I was four. I traveld with Kisame for 5 years, when we
we're travelin we met up with Itachi Uchiha too.</P><P>"He taught me stuff
too; also since he trained me the sharingan doesn't effect me. I
also met Sasori of the sand, Deidara of, hmm... I don't remember. I
also met Hiden and Zetsu too. They all trained me too. Anyways when
they we're all done they had to leave so me and Kyuu-chan headed
this way.</P><P>"Are we in time to
take the genin test?" he finished. All the third and Iruka do was
nod their heads.</P><P>"Iruka isn't that
supposed to be starting in a couple minutes?"</P><P>"Yes it is. Come on
Naruto and Kyuu-chan wasn't it?" Kyuu nodded her head. And the
three went to the academy.</P><P>"I wonder where
Iruka-sensei is." Asked a girl with blond hair. A girl with pink
hair nodded her head in agreement.</P><P>"He went to tell the
Hokage about that strange couple." Said a boy with a pineapple due
said. The boy next to him with to triangles on his face was about to
say something when the door opened.</P><P>"Iruka-sensei!"
said the girl with pink hair.</P><P>"I'm sorry we are
late." He said. Then the girl with blond hair said</P><P>"What do you mean
'we' it's only you." Then Iruka smiled and said</P><P>"They should be he-."
As he was about to finish a swirl of water and fire appeared next to
Iruka. As it was dyeing down Iruka said</P><P>"here they are."
Everyone gasped. It was the couple they saw earlier. The two just
looked at them.</P><P>"You see him."
Asked the girl.</P><P>"yup." Said the
boy. "this should be interesting."</P><P>"Don't for get what
he said though."</P><P>"right. I guess it
won't be interesting until the exam then." And the boy sighed and
the girl laughed.</P><P>"Would you two please
introduce your self's." Iruka said.</P><P>"Eh?! O right."
Said the boy.</P><P>"I'm Naruto." He
said with a bored tone. He then herd</P><P>"Loser." Then he
was gone.</P><P>"Hmm." And everyone
looked behind the boy who said loser. There was Naruto behind him,
inspecting him.</P><P>"What?!" asked the
boy.</P><P>"Saskue Uchiha
disgrace to the Uchiha clan, emo prick, avenger, weak…" he paused
and smirked then continued "gay." Then he wasn't there behind
him when Saskue went to attack him.</P><P>Then in the blink of an
eye Naruto was coming up from the ground and stood beside Iruka and
girl. Then the girls with blond and pink hair yelled</P><P>"SASKUE-KUN IS NOT
GAY!" the boy just sighed.</P><P>"Whatever. When you
really think about it, it would make a lot of since, Ino Yamanaka,
Sakura Haruno." The two gasped.</P><P>"What are you
thinking Naru-chan?" asked the girl.</P><P>"I'm thinking…
why would Itachi let his little brother live? Really look at him."
Then Saskue stood up and yelled while throwing a kunai</P><P>"Who are you
really?!" Naruto caught the kunai in his hand, witch everyone
gasped at even Iruka and answered</P><P>"A friend of your
brother's." with a smirk on his face. That just made him madder.
Then before he could yell the boy with the pineapple due asked</P><P>"Who is she?"</P><P>"I am Kyuu-san,
Shikamaru Nara." The boy nodded his head.</P><P>"Can we start now?"
Naruto asked. Iruka nodded his head yes and they began.</P><P>(I'm not gonna write
about this cause you can figure it out, Kyuu and Naruto passed with
flyin colors, also I am too lazy.)</P><P>To celebrate Naruto and
Kyuu went to the ramen stand. Then they went to look for an
apartment. When they were all done they went to sleep. They had to
wake up early so that they could train a little before they went to
find out what team them would be on.</P><P><B>This is the 1</B><B>st</B><B>
chapie! I hope you liked it! Let me know what you think!</B></P><P><B>YoukaiYumeKagome

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><P><B>You know the drill.
I don't own Naruto, for if I did Naruto would be powerful and
smart! Getting off track whoops! On with the story…</B></P><P>Naruto and Kyuu were
the first ones there. (if you don't know who Kyuu-chan is then…
never mind it would just be sad. But I am sure you all know who it
is!) Once everyone was there they were all divided into teams. I am
only listing the main teams.</P><P>Teams:</P><P>Team 7: Naruto, Kyuu,
Sakura, Saskue, Sensei: Kakashi</P><P>Team 8: Hinata, Shino,
Kiba, Sensei: Kurenai</P><P>Shikamaru, Ino, Choji,
Sensei: Asuma</P><P><B>With Squad 7</B></P><P>"Where is he?!"
screeched Sakura.</P><P>"Morning stone."
Naruto stated and continued to talk to Kyuu.</P><P>Sakura and Saskue
started at them. Kyuu was sitting on a desk with her feet hanging
over the edge. Naruto had both hands on either side of her legs
leaning forward. Naruto looked out the corner of his eye and saw them
staring at them. He sighed and said</P><P>"What?"</P><P>"How do you know
that, dobe?" Saskue said with a smirk. Naruto looked at him then at
Kyuu.</P><P>"Still don't know
why he left the gaki breathin."</P><P>She just shock her
head. "You know why."</P><P>"But he could have
killed him and let some other gaki in his clan to do it."</P><P>"I know but he wanted
that gaki to." The two sighed.</P><P>"You know him best
Naru-chan."</P><P>"I know, I know."</P><P>Before Saskue could say
anything Sakura said</P><P>"You never answered
the question."</P><P>"I know because I
know." Before any more the silver ninja entered.</P><P>"First opinon: I hate
you all. Meet me on the roof top." And he was gone in a swirl of
leaves. With that Naruto put his arm around Kyuu's waist and left
in a swirl of water and fire. Sakura and Saskue walked up to the
roof.</P><P>Kakashi sat on the roof
waiting for the four of them to come up. What Kakashi didn't expect
was a swirl of water and fire appear just one minute after him. There
standing where two of the four. To say he was shocked would be an
understatement.</P><P>"H-how did you do
that?" The two smirked. Then they sat down and after they sat down
the other two came out.</P><P>"Introduce yourself
tell your likes and dislikes and your dream."</P><P>"You go first
sensei." Said Sakura.</P><P>"Kakashi Hatake likes
and dislikes none of your business, dream never really thought about
it. Next."</P><P>I'm Sakura Haruno,
likes..." looks at Saskue, giggles, "dislikes those two and
Ino-pig. Dream..." looks at Saskue, giggles. Naruto and Kyuu rolled
eyes, Kakashi sweat drops.</P><P>"Next."</P><P>"Saskue Uchiha likes
not a lot, dislikes most stuff, dream to kill someone and revive my
clan."</P><P>"I give him 5
minutes."</P><P>"That's only long
enough for the speech."</P><P>"I know." Naruto
said with his smirk. Kyuu laughed. Saskue glared at them.</P><P>"Next." <I>Hmm...
didn't get a lot from Saskue.</I></P><P>"Naruto. Likes my
senseis, the old man, Kyuu-chan, ramen. Dislikes emo prick, banshee
bitch, Orochimaru and his gay lover Kabuto. Dream none of your
business."</P><P>"Next." <I>Dead
last, acts like a bad ass. Though I need to find out what his last
name is.</I></P><P>"Kyuu. Likes my
senseis, Naru-chan, Death,-." Before she could finish Kakashi said</P><P>"Death? You like it
when people die?"</P><P>"Not that kind of
death. Mine and Naru-chan's friend." They all looked at them.
Naruto sighed and pulled out a scroll. He then got Kyuu off his lap
bit his thumb.</P><P>"Summoning Jutsu:
Fox!" Naruto yelled and a medium dog size fox appeared.</P><P>They all looked at it.</P><P>"What?" he asked as
the fox jumped into his arms.</P><P>"He's made of just
bones!" Sakura yelled. This earned her a growl from all three of
them. She shrunk so to speak.</P><P>"You can summon?"
yelled both Kakashi and Saskue.</P><P>"Yeah. So?"</P><P>"You shouldn't be
able to." Kakashi said.</P><P>"Well I do."</P><P>"Anyways you can
finish now Kyuu-ch-."</P><P>"Kyuu-san." She
corrected.</P><P>He glared at her. "Just
finish."</P><P>"Dislikes and dream
same as Naru-chan."</P><P>Kakashi sighed and said</P><P>"Tomorrow I will give
you a test. So get some sleep and don't eat breakfast. Also the
success rate is 5 so if you fail you won't be able to make it up
again and you can't graduate." As he was about to leave Naruto
snorted.</P><P>"What?" Kakashi
said.</P><P>"So what if we fail."</P><P>"You won't be able
to start over and you will never be a ninja." Now this made Naruto
and Kyuu laugh, same with Death if you can call it a laugh.</P><P>"What are you
laughing about dobe?"</P><P>"If us two don't
pass all we have to do is go the mist village." Kakashi looked at
him and said</P><P>"Only the clans of
that village can take the test there."</P><P>"Yup."</P><P>"So you won't be
able to take it."</P><P>"Yes I will."</P><P>"I just told you that
you woul-." Kakashi's eye widened a bit.</P><P>Naruto and Kyuu
smirked.</P><P>"What were you going
to say Kakashi sensei?" Sakura said.</P><P>"How?" was all
Kakashi said.</P><P>"What do you mean
how?" Saskue said.</P><P>"My father is from
here. My mother there."</P><P>"That would mean you
have family."</P><P>"Yes."</P><P>"Your not supo-."</P><P>"I'm not supposed
to, I know. My uncle saved me from death when I was about to die at
the age of 5. That was when I left this horrid village. Anyways we
have to go. Bye." With that Naruto, Kyuu, and Death left in a swirl
of water and fire.</P><P>"Well see you."
Kakashi said and then he left in a swirl of leaves. When he was gone
Sakura kept asking Saskue questions until he left.</P><P><B>Next morning…</B></P><P>As they waited for
their 'sensei' Sakura kept trying to get Emo-Prick to go on a
date with her. While he glared at the couple across from them.</P><P>Naruto was leaning
against the bridge railing while Kyuu stood in-between his legs with
her arms draped loosely around his neck with his hands resting on her
hips, talking. When Kakashi got there Sakura yelled at him for being
late while all Kakashi could do was stare at Kyuu.</P><P>"Kakashi I'd advise
you to stop staring at my girl." Naruto growled calmly without
taking his eyes off of Kyuu in front of him, making Kakashi gulp.</P><P>"Let's go to
training ground 7 to do the test. When they got there Kakashi held up
two bells.</P><P>"The two who get the
bells pass while the other two don't and the two that lost will be
tied up to a pole while the other two eat a bento in front of them."
Saskue and Sakura paled while Naruto and Kyuu smirked.</P><P>"Good thing we ate."
Kyuu said. The others looked at them.</P><P>"What?"</P><P>"What?"</P><P>"We know the whole
point of this."</P><P>"How?" Kakashi
asked.</P><P>"I.t.a.c.h.i." she
said. Kakashi cursed under his breath then said</P><P>"O well. Begin!"</P><P><B>This is the 2</B><B>nd</B><B>
chapie hope you liked it! Let me know what you think! </B></P><P><B>YoukaiYumeKagome

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><B>You know the drill.
I don't own Naruto. Now on with the show…</B></P><P><B>Last time…</B></P><P>"<I>O well. Begin!"
</I></P><P><B>Now…</B></P><P>Sakura and Saskue went
straight into the woods while Naruto and Kyuu just stood there.
Kakashi stood there with his Ica Ica Paradise book. Naruto took out a
scroll then he bit his thumb.</P><P>"Summoning Jutsu:
Fox!" when the smoke settled there sat Death. Death looked at
Kakashi then at Naruto and Kyuu, Naruto nodded his head yes. Then
when Death turned back around Kakashi could have sworn he saw the fox
skeleton smirk at him. Before he knew it the fox charged him. Kakashi
dodged easily and looked at the two.</P><P>When he looked at them
he saw them smirking. Then he saw the fox walk up to them with
something in its mouth. He finally realized what it was when Naruto
retrofit it from the fox. Then the fox dashed into the bushes.</P><P>"Now Naruto you
wouldn't really would you?"</P><P>"Why of course not
'sensei'." Then Naruto held the book up and said</P><P>"Fire Style: Fire
Ball Jutsu!" then he took a breath a small one Kakashi just stood
there thinking that it wouldn't do any damage but then he saw
Naruto and Kyuu smirk and then Naruto let go of his breath and then
the book was engulfed into flames.</P><P>Kakashi looked on
unbelief.</P><P>"What? You should've
known it was gonna be big."</P><P>"B-but it was a tiny
breath! Naruto!!" Naruto put his arm around Kyuu's waist and
before leaving he said</P><P>"That was easy. We
all pass."</P><P>"What do you mean?"
Then Saskue and Sakura came out both holding a bell.</P><P>"How?"</P><P>"Well originally I
summoned Death to just get the bells but he also wanted to get your
book. So while I was burning your book he was giving the bells to
Saskue and Sakura."</P><P>Kakashi paled.</P><P>"You pass." And he
left in leaves and Naruto and Kyuu left in water and fire.</P><P>Naruto and Kyuu went to
the hokage.</P><P>"Ol-!" Naruto
stopped when he saw four people there.</P><P>"O bad time I'm
guessing. Well time to g-."</P><P>"Naruto. Kyuu-chan."
They turned around.</P><P>"Yeah old man?"</P><P>"This is the…"</P><P>"Kazekage, his kids
Temari the oldest, Kankuro the middle, Gaara the youngest and the
vessel for Shukaku. Nice to meet you. I'm Naruto and this is my
girlfriend Kyuu-chan." They all looked at him.</P><P>"What?" Kyuu
giggled.</P><P>"How did you know?"</P><P>"Traveling and
training around the country for 8 years you learn things. Also I am
also a vessel. And the reason why Shukaku is leaving Gaara alone
right know is because I am here. Also Me and Kyuu-chan, well mostly
me could help him too." He sighed.</P><P>"How is it that
because of you Shukaku is leaving me alone, and how would you be able
to help me?" The third, Kazekage, Temari, and Kankuro looked at him
shocked. Then they looked at Naruto and Kyuu, Naruto was also holding
Death.</P><P>"And what is that?"</P><P>"Hmm… O because my
demon is dominate against Shukaku. I can redo your seal so you will
be sane and Shukaku will leave you alone, and you will be able to
sleep. Also this is Death. He is a summoning, though he is with us
most of the time." Gaara was shocked.</P><P>He then looked to his
dad. Then looked back and telepathically he said 'We'll talk
later.' Naruto nodded his head. (Demon vassal's can talk to each
other telepathically.)</P><P>"Naruto what did you
want to say?"</P><P>"O! We all passed.
Kakashi is in the hospital because I burned his book, cause he
underestimated me. Also tell him he needs to come up with a harder
test. That was easy."</P><P>"How long did it take
you?"</P><P>"I don't know maybe
a minute or less. We didn't have a watch." The third sweat
dropped.</P><P>"O and could you do
us a favor old man?"</P><P>"I'm afraid to ask.
What?"</P><P>"No D-rank missions.
More like B's & A's maybe?"</P><P>"Naruto."</P><P>"Hai?"</P><P>"You have Saskue and
Sakura on your team."</P><P>"Crap I forgot about
them. Hmm. I know!"</P><P>"What?"</P><P>"Me, Kyuu-chan, and
Death in a squad!" the third looked at him.</P><P>"What? Kiba has
Akumaru."</P><P>"But he is in a team
with Hinata and Shino." Naruto sighed and put his arm around Kyuu's
waist. "But…"</P><P>"Hai?!"</P><P>"I will send you all
Kakashi, you, Kyuu-chan, Saskue, and Sakura on a C-ranked mission. If
your performance is well then I will put you, Kyuu-chan, and Death in
a squad. Maybe get Jiraiya to be your teacher. Deal?"</P><P>"One, Jiraiya is one
of my past senseis. He trained me on the way here. Two, Deal!"</P><P>"Okay. Get ready
tomorrow morning come here."</P><P>"'Kay! Talk to you
later Gaara, you should be able to find me telepathically." With
that him, Kyuu, and Death left in a swirl of water and ice. Then
Kakashi appeared with Saskue and Sakura in a swirl of leaves.</P><P>"Hokage-sama you
wouldn't happen to have a copy of Ica Ica Paradise would you?"</P><P>"Naruto?"</P><P>"And his little foxy
too!" the third laughed.</P><P>"O Kakashi, Saskue,
Sakura get packed for a mission, and come here tomorrow morning at
8:00 a.m. sharp! It is a C-ranked mission."</P><P>"What about the dobe,
and wen-." Saskue never finished because sand attacked him.</P><P>"What the hell?!"</P><P>"You should know
better then to talk like that to people who are more powerful then
you." Said a voice full of hate.</P><P>"He spook again!"
Temari said. "Thank you Naruto!" Gaara glared at her playfully
and Temari and Kankuro fainted.</P><P>"Where is that boy I
want to give him a gift!" the Kazekage said.</P><P>"Anyways Naruto and
Kyuu-chan…"</P><P>"And Death." Gaara
said.</P><P>"And Death just left
moments ago and he is the one who requested a B-rank or higher but I
told him I would give you a C-rank one. O and Kakashi!" the hokage
said before they left.</P><P>"Hai?"</P><P>"Naruto said you need
to think of a harder test. And here is the book." He then threw a
book at him.</P><P>"Arigatou
Hokage-sama." And the three left.</P><P>"Gaara."</P><P>"Hai?"</P><P>"One thank you for
defending Naruto, Kyuu-chan, and Death while they are not here. Two
since you will probably see them later would you tell them 8:00 a.m.
for me. And please be his friend, he knows what it is like. He was
almost killed by some of the villagers when he was 5. He just arrived
back in Kohona yesterday. He has been travelin and training since he
was healed by one of his senseis."</P><P>Gaara nodded his head
and left in a swirl of sand.</P><P>"Those two boys'
are amazing." The third said and the Kazekage nodded his head in
agreement.</P><P>Gaara arrived in a tree
on a branch from Naruto with his back against the trees trunk with
Kyuu sitting in his lap. He had his arms around her waist. While she
had Death in her lap petting him. While she leaned against Naruto.
Naruto opened his eyes when Gaara sat down.</P><P>"Konnichiwa Gaara."</P><P>"Konnichiwa
Gaara-kun, Shukaku no baka." Kyuu said witch earned an eye brow at
the last part.</P><P>"Konnichiwa." said
Death. Gaara did not even question that.</P><P>"Konnichiwa."</P><P>"So what you wanna
talk about?"</P><P>"Stuff. Hokage-sama
wanted me to tell you that be in the office at 8:00 a.m. sharp. And
why did you say 'Shukaku no baka?'" he asked the last part.</P><P>"Before we start.
Make a Kage Bunshin (shadow clone justu) but instead of your chakra
use Shukaku's." When Gaara did beside him sat a man with sandy
blond hair, hazel eyes, and tan skin. He wore a regular shirt, pants,
and shoes.</P><P>"Thank you gaki."
The man said.</P><P>"Long time no see
Shukaku no baka." Kyuu said. Gaara raised an eye brow.</P><P>"Long time no see
Kyuubi no wench." That earned him a kunai in the forehead. And he
disappeared. Gaara had to make another Kage Bunshin. This time the
man was rubbing his forehead.</P><P>"Not a good idea to
call her that." Naruto said.</P><P>"No shit gaki."
Another kunai to his forehead, but from Naruto. Gaara glared at him.</P><P>"Gomen." Naruto
said. Once again Gaara made a Kage Bunshin.</P><P>"Stop that!"
Shukaku yelled. The four laughed at him (yes Gaara laughed).</P><P>"So you can fix my
seal?"</P><P>"Hai." Just then
before they could talk Saskue appeared along with Temari and Kankuro.
Saying they were pissed is an understatement.</P><P>"Can I kill your team
mate, Naruto-san?" Temari and Kankuro said at the same time. Naruto
and Gaara chuckled. Temari and Kankuro looked at each other then back
to Naruto.</P><P>"Sorry you can't
maybe in a couple years really depends if I beat you to it. And you
don't need to call me 'Naruto-san' either. Just call me
'Naruto-kun' and Gaara you can just call me Naruto." Gaara
nodded his head and Temari and Kankuro said</P><P>"Hai!"</P><P>"Gaara tou-san said
it is time to go." Gaara nodded. Before he left Naruto whispered
for those only in the tree.</P><P>"Gaara keep
Kyuu-chan's secret please." Gaara nodded his head. Then they all
looked to Subaku.</P><P>"What?" he asked.
Kyuu smirked and took out a kunai. Shukaku started to back away.</P><P>"Bye baka!!" she
sang and threw the kunai. Gaara looked at Kyuu and Naruto said</P><P>"Blood Kage Bunshin
can only kill her if her head is chopped off."</P><P>"O." Is all Gaara
said. Then they all jumped out the tree. When they landed Naruto said</P><P>"What do you want
Emo-prick?"</P><P>"Fight me." Now
this put all of them on the ground laughing their asses off.</P><P>"Some other time,
maybe. O let me show you guys this." Then he sent the memories of
when he called Saskue gay and all. When they were over the sand
siblings were laughing. And laughing hard. Then they all left in
swirls and all ended in front of the gate where the Hokage and
Kazekage where at. They looked at them strangely and once again
Naruto did the memory thing again and this time it was the hokage and
Kazekage laughing.</P><P>"Naruto-san." The
Kazekage said.</P><P>"Hai?"</P><P>"When you three are
on a squad together come visit us anytime."</P><P>"Hai! We would like
that very much." Then they said their goodbyes and Naruto said that
he and Gaara would talk again about the seal the next time they would
meet. Then the four were off.</P><P>"When they were gone
Naruto turned to the Hokage and said</P><P>"I don't trust the
Kazekage."</P><P>"Me either." And
they all nodded their heads in agreement. Then they went their
separate ways.</P><P><B>That was the 3</B><B>rd</B><B>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br>I don't own Naruto<P><B>I don't own
Naruto. On with the story…</B></P><P><B>0.o0.o0.o0.o</B></P><P>Team 7 arrived at 8:00
a.m. sharp in the Hokage's office some by foot others leaves and
water/fire.</P><P>"Okay what is the
mission old man?" Naruto said when they got there. Saskue and
Sakura glared at him.</P><P>"You're just upset
cause you wouldn't be able to get away with callin him 'old
man'." They once more glared at him. He ignored them. Kyuu just
giggled.</P><P>"Anyways your mission
is to guard Tazuna here to Wave country."</P><P>"Yo! These gaki's?"</P><P>"These are the best
genin we have."</P><P>"I don't know.
What's yer name kid?" Sakura pointed to Naruto. Tazuna nodded his
head.</P><P>"His name is Naruto."</P><P>"He's also the
weakest." Saskue added.</P><P>"See even the black
hair gaki says so." The Tazuna felt something on his neck.</P><P>"Here are some words
of advice old man. One don't call me a gaki. Two me and my girl are
the strongest ones here. Three Emo-Prick here is the second weakest
and gay." The last one he smirked.</P><P>"SASKUE-KUN IS NOT
GAY!!" as Sakura yelled this Naruto closed his eyes and covered his
ears. Then as Kyuu cleaned a kunai said</P><P>"Really? Then why did
Naru-chan, Death, and myself see him and Sai in a lip lock in an
ally?" know this is when everyone but Naruto and Kyuu looked
shocked.</P><P>"Allies are not the
best place to make out. Next time make sure it is in one of your
rooms. Oh and Sakura." He then was behind her and whispered in her
ear. When he pulled away she looked so shocked.</P><P>"What did you say?!"
yelled Saskue. Naruto smirked and said</P><P>"I told her that you
were uke." Now this made Saskue blush and shut up.</P><P>Kakashi was the first
one to recover from the shock and said</P><P>"Well lets get this
mission over with." Then the 5 of them left. On their way to the
gate Kyuu asked</P><P>"Naru-chan will you
summon Mizuki for me? I want to talk to her."</P><P>"Sure." Then Naruto
opened a scroll and yelled</P><P>"Summoning Jutsu:
Wolf!" when they looked the saw a silver she wolf. She was about as
big as an adult horse.</P><P>"Konnichiwa
Naruto-kun! How may I serve you?"</P><P>"Kyuu-chan wanted to
ride and talk to you on our way to Wave country."</P><P>"That is fine with
me. Konnichiwa Kyuu-chan!" the wolf said happily.</P><P>"Konnichiwa Mizuki!"
she answered. Everyone looked between the wolf and Naruto.</P><P>"What?" he asked.</P><P>"How many summoning
scrolls have you signed? And which ones?"</P><P>"Lets see, 16. There
is foxes, wolfs, birds, toads, snakes, nekos, demons, and monkeys,
also bugs." Kakashi and everyone looked at him.</P><P>"What? You shouldn't
even be surprised."</P><P>"Your right we
shouldn't."</P><P>"Let's go already."
Naruto said.</P><P><B>0.o0.o0.o0.o</B></P><P>After walking half way
Kyuu spotted a puddle. She tapped Naruto on the shoulder and he
whispered</P><P>"I know. I have a
plan." She nodded and Naruto sped up and ran through the puddle.</P><P>"Ow!" said the
puddle. Naruto smirked and said</P><P>"Oops. Sorry."</P><P>Then all of a claw came
up and wrapped around Naruto, Kyuu, Mizuki, and Kakashi. Then it
tightened and then poof!</P><P>"Naruto, Kyuu,
Kakashi-sensei!" Sakura yelled. Then two figures came up out of the
puddle. The one on the right started to attack. Then the one on the
left clawed Saskue on the arm and the one on the right was about to
finish him off when Kakashi came out of the bushes and knocked the
two out and tied them to a tree. Then they all herd clapping.</P><P>"Who's there?!"</P><P>"Well done, well
done." Said a voice.</P><P>"But your dead."
Saskue said.</P><P>"Did you really think
that the Demon Brothers could kill us? Man no wonder Itachi let you
live, your really entertaining." To this Saskue growled and then
the three came out of the trees.</P><P>"Coward's!"
Sakura yelled.</P><P>"We are not cowards
banshee bitch. We wanted to scout ahead." Kyuu said.</P><P>"Why you!" Sakura
yelled. Kyuu just smirked. Then Naruto looked to the brothers tied
up. He then took water and poured it on them.</P><P>"Hey what's th-?!"
the one on the left started but then he saw the person in front of
them and stared and said</P><P>"Naruto-kun!
Kyuu-san! Mizuki-chan! Where's Death-kun?"</P><P>"Not here right now."</P><P>"I saved him a bone."
The on the right said.</P><P>"He's gonna like
that. Let me get him. Summoning Jutsu: Fox!" there stood Death in
all his bones.</P><P>"Hi Death-kun!' the
two said.</P><P>"Hi!"</P><P>"We have a bone for
you."</P><P>"Really?!" and his
tail started to wag his tail. Then they got the bone and gave it to
him.</P><P>"What are you doing
anyways you two?" Naruto asked. The one petting Death said</P><P>"This guy named Gato
hired Zabuza to kill the bridge builder." Naruto nodded his head.</P><P>"Go find some other
job." He said.</P><P>"Hai! Bye!" the
brothers said together, and they were gone. Kakashi looked at Naruto.</P><P>"Friends." Was all
Naruto said and they were on their way again.</P><P>'<I>Who is this kid
really?'</I> Kakashi thought.</P><P><B>0.o0.o0.o0.o</B></P><P>After walking for
another hour Naruto yelled</P><P>"Duck!" then once
everyone was down a big sword soared right over their heads. And a
man stood on it.</P><P>"So they were telling
the truth."</P><P>"Zabuza!"</P><P>"Yo! How you been?"</P><P>"We're okay I
guess. Death has missed you." As if on cue Death tackled Zabuza
making Naruto, Kyuu, and Mizuki laugh.</P><P>"They put you as a
regular genin?"</P><P>"We asked the old man
too."</P><P>"O. Why? Your better
then copy cat here."</P><P>"Yeah. But we wanted
to do it this way."</P><P>"True but now you're
with copy cat, emo-pick, and banshee bitch."</P><P>"Not for long."
Naruto said.</P><P>"Congrats. Herd from
your uncle?"</P><P>"Nope. You?"</P><P>"Nope."</P><P>"You here cause of
Gato?"</P><P>"Naruto-kun I'm
hurt." Said a voice.</P><P>"Itachi!" Naruto
said. Itachi laughed.</P><P>"We finally figured
out why you left emo-prick alive!"</P><P>"Now I am
interested." Itachi said.</P><P>"You left him alive
cause he is entertaining."</P><P>"Part of the reason."</P><P>"So are you and Eriko
having kids soon? Someone needs to rebuild your clan."</P><P>"What about my
foolish brother?"</P><P>"Gay." Kyuu said.
Itachi raised an eye brow.</P><P>"Really?"</P><P>"Yup. Saw him and Sai
makin out in a ally." She said. Then she handed him a picture. Then
she and Naruto jumped. Then Naruto was gone. Saskue felt something on
his neck.</P><P>"Didn't you learn
your lesson already. By the way the claws you were scratched with
were poisoned." Naruto told him. Then he appeared behind Kyuu and
wrapped his arms around her waist and put his chin on top of her
head. While Zabuza and Itachi looked at the picture.</P><P>"No wonder he didn't
attack you." Zabuza said to Itachi. Once they had stopped laughing.</P><P>"How have you been
'Tachi?" Kyuu asked.</P><P>"Okay for an S-class
criminal. How have you been?"</P><P>"You already know. I
almost killed Kabuto."</P><P>"You did?" Naruto
nodded his head.</P><P>"What did he do?"</P><P>"Orochimaru came to
ask me if I would join him. And I tricked him too."</P><P>"Now I'm
interested." Itachi said.</P><P>"I told him that if
he let me sign the snake summoning scroll I would. So he did then I
told him I wouldn't join him so he tried to put the curse mark on
me put I cut his head off. Then Kabuto healed him.</P><P>Orochimaru told him to
kill us. So we fought. I won. As I was about to give the killing blow
Orochimaru picked him up and they left. I was sooo close!"</P><P>"Your uncle will be
so proud. If I see him before you I will tell him."</P><P>"Thanks Itachi. Also
send letters to me too. All of you. Along with my uncle, you, Zabuza
you too, Haku, Sasori, Deidara, Hiden, Zetsu, etc." The two nodded.
Then Zabuza said</P><P>"I'll send Haku to
see you soon."</P><P>"Arigato. Bye."</P><P>"Bye. See you." And
the two ninja left. Nobody asked questions and they continued on to
Tazuna's house.</P><P><B>0.o0.o0.o0.o</B></P><P><B>That was chapie 4!

<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P><B>I don't own
Naruto, you know that.</B></P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P>"Okay." Kakashi
said.</P><P>"Okay what?" Naruto
asked.</P><P>"What the hell was
that?!" Kakashi said. Naruto looked at him innocently, something he
isn't.</P><P>"That?"</P><P>"You know what."</P><P>"O you mean Zabuza
and Itachi? Or the poison thing?"</P><P>"Both."</P><P>"Well first, Saskue
your sharingan won't work on me. Second-." Saskue interrupted.</P><P>"What do you mean it
won't work on you?"</P><P>"Just that. Itachi
trained me from the age of 6 to the age of 10, so it won't work. We
are immune against it. Second we were just talking."</P><P>"How do you know
them?" Kakashi asked.</P><P>"They have both
trained me, they are my friends, and they are my family."</P><P>"Who all trained
you?"</P><P>"If I wanted you to
know Kakashi then I would have told you. It is not any of your damn
business."</P><P>"No wonder no one
likes you." Sakura said.</P><P>"Shut the hell up!"
Naruto said.</P><P>"I bet your mom and
dad abandon you and left you! They didn't want a basterd of a son!
I bet they didn't love you." She yelled back. Naruto stood up
grabbed his coat and sword, and walked away.</P><P>Everyone sat in
silence. Then Kyuu stood up her eyes full of hate and evil. She
looked Sakura in the eyes. Everyone could feel the killer intent.
Then she said</P><P>"You little girl have
no idea what hell is like! You little girl have no idea what it is
like to not have a family. None of you damn know what he has gone
through. Kakashi your sensei would, no scratch that he is
disappointed in you. I would bet my soul that he is. You were one of
the ANBU supposed to protect him before he left the village and you
stood there while they beat him to the brink of death! You treat the
village hero like the thing he isn't. He could kill you all with
out raising a hand."</P><P>"You know nothing of
my sensei!" Kakashi yelled.</P><P>"Yes I do. I knew
him. His dyeing wish was that Naruto would be treated as a hero not a
damn DEMON!! I know he is upset with you!"</P><P>"No you do not!"</P><P>"Yes I do!! You treat
HIS son like the thing he ISN'T!!" Kakashi paled.</P><P>"Y-y-you mean!?"</P><P>"YES I DO! Naruto now
is far stronger then his father and mother put together, and that is
VERY, VERY strong! Enjoy the rest of the mission by yourselves. Also
Sakura if I fight you in the Exam I WILL KILL YOU." with that Kyuu
followed by Death left.</P><P>Kakashi sat back in his
chair. He looked like he was going to die.</P><P>"Sensei what is she
talking about?" Saskue asked. Kakashi looked at them. Then Kakashi
then said</P><P>"Sakura I hope you
don't fight against her so you live." Sakura paled.</P><P>"What did she mean?"
Saskue asked again. Kakashi sighed.</P><P>"You know about the
nine tailed fox right?"</P><P>"Yeah it attacked the
village 13 years ago and the forth killed it." Sakura said.</P><P>"Wrong. He wasn't
able too. No one could. So the forth sealed it in a new born baby
who's umbilical cord was just cut." He paused and looked down.</P><P>"His dying wish was
that the baby would be treated like a hero not as the demon that was
seal in him. He then said that the baby's name would be… Naruto."
He herd gasps.</P><P>"Y-you mean that the
Kyuubi no Kitsune is sealed in Naruto?" Sakura said. Kakashi nodded
his head. "So his mom and dad abandoned him because of the fox?"</P><P>"No. Naruto's mom
died in child birth and his dad died in the attack." Kakashi
finished.</P><P>"Naruto was all by
himself until he found his uncle and sensei's. Have you ever seen
the looks and the names they call Naruto?" they nodded their heads.</P><P>"The third had to do
the grocery shopping, after Itachi left the village, for Naruto
because the others would get him rotten food. He has never been the
hero. But always been the demon."</P><P>"What do you mean
'after Itachi left'?" Saskue asked.</P><P>"Itachi was the only
one that was nice to Naruto. He was also able to get the best fresh
food too because he is an Uchiha. In a way he was like an older
brother to Naruto. He also used to train Naruto before he left. If
Naruto was in the village walking down a street Itachi was with him.</P><P>"Some people would
even get the courage to throw and spit at Naruto's feet so Itachi
would pick him up and carry him on his shoulders and back. The third,
Naruto, and Itachi would all have pictures of Naruto and Itachi
together. The reason Naruto doesn't attack the village is probably
because…</P><P>"His father is from
Kohona, Itachi used to live there, and the third and Iruka." When
he was done Kakashi bowed his head in shame.</P><P>"Kakashi-sensei who
was Naruto's father and your sensei?" Sakura asked.</P><P>"I am not allowed to
tell. Sorry."</P><P>"O… okay." Little
did they know that little Inari had snuck out.</P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P>Kyuu found Naruto
sitting on the dock. He was looking down in the water.</P><P>"I have always
wondered what it would be like to have a mom and a dad. Specially a
dad that was the Hokage." He laughed bitterly at the last part.</P><P>"Well you wouldn't
be so powerful, you wouldn't have a lot of jutsu's, or a lot of
sensei's, summoning's, or me." Kyuu said. She then sat down
next to him. Naruto put his arm around her and took in her scent.</P><P>"I would defiantly
miss your scent. And your company, though I would be able to talk to
you in my head." He said. She giggled and leaned into his touch.
Naruto then scooted back and put her in his lap. Then Naruto herd
footsteps, when he turned around he was shocked. It was Tazuna's
grandson Inari.</P><P>"Hi."</P><P>"H-hi." Kyuu turned
and smiled at him. He smiled right back. He then walked over to them.</P><P>"Would you like to
sit in my lap?" Kyuu asked him. Inari nodded his head and sat down
in her lap. Kyuu started playing with his hands and he played right
back. Naruto smiled at them. <I>She will be a good mother. Once it is
safe enough then we can have kits.</I> He thought to him self as he
watched them. After an hour or two Inari said</P><P>"I don't have a dad
either." Naruto and Kyuu looked down at him; he was looking in the
water as he spoke.</P><P>"When I was littler a
couple of the older kids took my dog Pochi. The leader said that
Pochi was now his dog. But I tried to fight back and he threw Pochi
in the water. I couldn't swim, I still can't. But then they
pushed me in the water and I tried to get to my dog but at the last
minute he learned to doggie paddled. Once he got to shore he took
off.</P><P>I called for help but
no one came. After a while I was swept under and fell unconscious.
When I woke up a man was there. He had saved me. He asked what had
happened and I told him. He said that I have to work hard so I can
protect my precious people.</P><P>He came over a lot and
he and my mom fell in love and he became my dad. A year past by and
we had rain fall one night. A couple villagers said that the dam came
open and if they didn't get it closed soon the town would be
flooded. When we got there it was so bad that someone needed to swim
across to close it and my dad volunteered.</P><P>They were able to close
it and the town was saved. Then Gato came with his ninja and rogues,
etc. and ruined everything. My dad fought back and was caught. Then
in front of everyone he was, was, was…" Inari paused and wiped
them away. Kyuu hugged him to her chest, and he hugged back.</P><P>"And in front of
everyone he was executed to show the public what would happen to
those who rebelled against him." Then Inari burst into tears. Kyuu
rubbed his back as he cried.</P><P>"Well then there is
only two things we can do, isn't there?" Naruto said and Inari
looked up at him and said</P><P>"Nani?"</P><P>"One. I'll just
have to get rid of Gato and his goons. Two. I will have to teach you
to swim. Also would you like me to give you a couple throwing
lessons?" Inari smiled at him and nodded his head.</P><P>"Well then I found
this beautiful lake that I could teach you in. So you ready to go
now?" Inari nodded his head and jumped up. Then the three set off
for the lake.</P><P>Unknown to them a woman
had been listening to them. When they were gone the woman ran to
Tazuna's house.</P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P>They all sat in silence
until they herd knocking on the door. Tsunami opened the door. There
in the door stood a happy old woman. Tsunami was shocked.</P><P>"Nakamura-san?!"
the old woman's smile got bigger if that is possible.</P><P>"Inari is learning to
swim!"</P><P>"What are you talking
about?! Inari hates the water."</P><P>"That couple that
came with those three were talking to him. The young man sat Indian
style with the woman sitting on his lap and Inari was sitting in her
lap! They talked and played for a couple hours and then Inari told
them about… well you know!</P><P>Then the young man
talked to him and Inari smiled!! His whole face lit up so brightly!
Then they took off to the lake so the young man could teach Inari to
swim, and Inari was so happy! He even held both of their hands! Those
two will make good parents some day." Just as she was finishing
Inari came running in soaking wet yelling</P><P>"Mommy! Mommy!
Naruto-san and Kyuu-chan taught me how to swim!! I can swim mama! I
can swim!!" Tsunami ran to him and picked him up twirling him
around and around laughing.</P><P>Kakashi, Saskue, and
Sakura looked from them to Tazuna. Tazuna was smiling with tears
running down his face.</P><P>"What's wrong
Tazuna-san?" Sakura asked.</P><P>"It has been years
since Inari last laughed and smiled. I'm just happy. He stopped
laughing and smiling when Kaiza died but now we have him back."
They all watched for a while and then Kakashi asked</P><P>"Inari where are
Naruto and Kyuu?"</P><P>"That's Naruto-san
and Kyuu-san to you one eye! And they are talking with friends. Their
friends are really nice! O I wanted to tell you that I could swim,
but I gotta go back so I can ride Mizuki-chan!" and with that he
was gone once more.</P><P>"Come on you two. We
are going to find out who these people are." Then Kakashi, Saskue,
and Sakura left. When they got there they could not believe their
eyes. There was tons of missing Nin and S-class criminals having a
barbecue!</P><P>There was Naruto, Kyuu,
Itachi, Zabuza, Haku, Kisame, Sasori, Deidara, Hiden, Zetsu, and tons
more! Along with tons of summoning's. They were all talking and
eating. Then everyone turned towards where they were and they all
were armed even Inari.</P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P><B>Okay everyone that
was the 5</B><B>th</B><B> chapie! Let me know what you
think!</B></P><P><B>YoukaiYumeKagome

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br>I do not own Naruto, blah blah blah blah<P><B>Sorry I took so
long!! I do not own Naruto, blah blah blah blah. On with the story…</B></P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P>"Come out with your
hands in the air." Naruto said.</P><P>"And wave them in the
air like you don't just care, un."</P><P>"Deidara."</P><P>"Hai Naruto-kun, un?"</P><P>"Shut the hell up."</P><P>"Arigato. I just
couldn't help my self, un." The red head sighed.</P><P>"Sasori, how do you…"
started a blue skinned man.</P><P>"Don't ask Kisame."
Sasori replied. Naruto sighed and turned back to team 7.</P><P>"What are you doing
here?"</P><P>"We came to find
Inari, dobe." Then before Saskue knew it he was pinned to the tree
by kunai.</P><P>"Alright! Awesome
shot Inari, 'un'!" Naruto, Itachi, and Deidara cried. The boy
just smiled.</P><P>"You don't mean!"</P><P>"If you mean: did I
teach Inari to throw kunai and shuriken and that he just pinned
Saskue, a genin, to a tree in less then 10 second? Then yes, yes I
do." Naruto said.</P><P>"No way!" Saskue
yelled.</P><P>"Yes way. I can't
wait to tell everyone about this!" Naruto said.</P><P>"You wouldn't!"</P><P>"O yes, yes he
would." Kyuu said.</P><P>"Now let's go kill
Gato. This should be easy. Inari go on home I'll stop by before we
leave okay?"</P><P>"Okay!"</P><P>"Mizuki please take
him home."</P><P>"Hai!"</P><P>"Bye!" Everyone
yelled. Except Kakashi, Saskue, and Sakura.</P><P>"Bye!" Inari yelled
back.</P><P>Then Naruto, Kyuu,
Zabuza, Haku, Kisame, Itachi, Deidara, and Sasori all left to find
Gato and kill him.</P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P>"Move out!" Gato
yelled to his goons.</P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P>The gang met Gato on
the bridge. Before they started Zabuza used his mist Jutsu. Then
Naruto made a ton of Shadow Clones and then the battle started. It
was over in less then 5 minutes. Gato was dead and the bridge was
almost finished.</P><P>After they were done
the Naru gang said their goodbye and they went their separate ways.
Then Naruto and Kyuu stopped by Inari's house.</P><P>"He is dead!" Naruto said. Inari smiled and ran up to Naruto and hugged him then he
hugged Kyuu. Naruto and Kyuu waited until the next afternoon, after
the bridge was done, to leave. Before they left Naruto said</P><P>"Don't worry we
will come back to visit." Then Inari hugged him and Kyuu once again
and started to cry.</P><P>"You better!" was
all he said. Tuzan shook Naruto's hand and said</P><P>"Thanks to you and
Kyuu-san Gato is dead and we have the real Inari back. We don't
know how to ever repay you."</P><P>"Never give up. If
you never give up then we are even." Naruto replied.</P><P>"You are welcome here
anytime."</P><P>"And we thank you."
Kyuu said. Tuzan smiled and said</P><P>"We decided to name
the bridge 'The Naru Kyuu Bridge' for every thing you have done
for us."</P><P>Naruto and Kyuu smiled
and they both said</P><P>"We will be back.
Good-bye!"</P><P>"Bye! Can I come
visit you?!" Inari asked.</P><P>"Of course you can!
Bye!" they both said.</P><P>"Good-bye!!"
everyone said.</P><P>Naruto and Kyuu left
with smiles on their faces. When they caught up to team 7 Sakura
asked</P><P>"What did they name
the bridge?" Naruto and Kyuu smiled.</P><P>"The Naru Kyuu
Bridge." They said. The other three's eyes widened.</P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P>They had just finished
giving their report when the Third said</P><P>"Alright, alright
Naruto we had a deal. What is the name?" Naruto and Kyuu looked at
each other. Then Naruto dropped a scroll on his desk.</P><P>The Third opened the
scroll and read the continents. He then looked at the two to see them
smirk. He rolled his eyes and said</P><P>"Only you two would
think of this."</P><P>"But of course."
Naruto said.</P><P>"The exam starts in
one day. Understand?"</P><P>"Hai." They both
said.</P><P>"That means that the
sand siblings will be here right?" Kyuu asked.</P><P>"But of course."
The Third said. Naruto smiled his foxy grin.</P><P>"Naruto what are you
thinking?"</P><P>"Just something for
me and Gaara to do. I'm sure he would love to help."</P><P>"Naruto!" the Third
yelled right before Naruto and Kyuu left in a swirl of water and
fire. When they were gone the Third hit his head on his desk over and
over again.</P><P>"What was that all
about."</P><P>"Hmm… o, well I
made a deal with them. Kakashi go train your team."</P><P>"But part of my team
just left."</P><P>"No they didn't it
is only Saskue and Sakura now. Especially after that stunt you
pulled! You three should be glad I am not throwing you in jail! Now
get out of my sight!" he yelled at them.</P><P>The three left after
they recovered from the shock. Then the Third pulled out his Ichi
Ichi Paradise book.</P><P><B>o.0o.0o.0</B></P><P>"Lets go get ramen!"
Naruto said. The other two nodded their heads in agreement. On their
way they ran into the other genins.</P><P>"That reminds me."
Naruto said. As they started to walk towards the group.</P><P>"Yo!" he said.</P><P>"Yo!"</P><P>"Hi."</P><P>"Hello."</P><P>"Konnichiwa."</P><P>"Troublesome."</P><P>"…"</P><P>"You guys won't
believe what happened on our mission."</P><P>"What?" Kiba asked.
Naruto smirked and said</P><P>"Saskue got pinned to
a tree in less then 10 seconds with kunai by a 6 year old who had
just been taught how to throw them!" everyone looked shocked.</P><P>"You are lying!"
Ino said.</P><P>"No he is not. He
isn't lying at all. 5 minutes after he taught the kid how to
Saskue, Sakura, and Kakashi came out of the trees, and Saskue made a
rude comment to Naru-chan right after he said it he found himself
pinned to a tree! And the boy was the one who did it! If they don't
believe you then show them the memory Naru-chan."</P><P>"Okay." Then he
sent it to them. Right after Kiba, Shikamaru, Hinata, Choji, and even
Ino were laughing. Even Shino was chuckling. Then Sakura and Saskue
came up.</P><P>"What are you
laughing about?" Sakura asked. Everyone pointed to Saskue.</P><P>"He showed them the
memory of Saskue getting pinned with kunai by a 6 year old in less
