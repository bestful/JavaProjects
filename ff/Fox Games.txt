Sato, or rather the Leaf Village went about it's normal routines like
it did any other day. The people inhabiting it moving to and fro,
whilst the grand forest surrounding it continued to thrive and
flourish, birds singing their morning songs while other small animals
went about finding food. This harmonic flow however was quickly
brought to an end.</P><P>Quickly jumping from branch to
branch with a balance only inherent to Shinobi two figures jumped
into a clearing of the forest around them.</P><P>"Come on Ero-Sennin, hurry up. I
haven't been here in three years and I wanna see what's changed." a
sun-kissed blonde replied as he can to an abrupt stop.</P><P>"Listen brat I'll move at my own
damn pace." a tall, white haired man said.</P><P>"What's gotten into you
Ero-Sennin?, don't tell me your still mad about me pushing you out
off that tree and into the women's bath for spying on them are you?"</P><P>The taller mans silence was more
that enough to answer the slightly shorter blonde's question.</P><P>"Hey you earned it for peeking
in on them."</P><P>"Would you just shut up already
Naruto..."</P><P>After a moment of silence that the
taller man was thankful for his student spoke up again.</P><P>"You think any of them will
recognize me?" Naruto asked in a more somber tone.</P><P>Jiraiya or affectionately
other-wise known as Ero-Sennin looked at his blue-eyed companion,
with a serious face, thinking about how far his student had come and
what he looked like. No longer was he the orange wearing, loud
mouthed brat that pulled pranks to get attention, but a strong and
driven young man.</P><P>Taking in he's appearance
seriously for the first time in months Jiraiya looked Naruto up and
down.</P><P>The most notifiable difference was
Naruto's height and what he was wearing. When he left he was
hands-down one of the shortest of the rookie nine. Now he stood
proudly at six feet, rather tall for his age and had broad shoulders
that practically screamed masculinity, this when combined with he's
tanned skin and outlandish blonde hair sticking up in random
directions, had caused quite a few women to grow weak in the knees at
the sight he presented. (Which Jiraiya tried to take advantage of on
a few occasions, only to end in pain...for the Toad Sannin) In favor
of the horrendous orange jumpsuit he now wore a sleeve-less, zip up
dark blue sweater with a high collar, adorned with his trade-mark
swirl on the back in a deep red, almost maroon color. The black cargo
pants he wore also sported deep red designs on the side of his pant
legs, this time however they were a mass of inter-mingling lines that
seemed to resemble tribal markings. Numerous belts clung to his waist
criss-crossing, each one holding various things for the blonde incase
he needed something quickly, amongst the different little packs the
belts held there were two curved swords that hung in the back of a
sliver-studded belt. . Instead of the usual blue ninja sandles he
wore black boots that were cut low. His ninja headband now hung
around his neck and it was attached to a black colored fabric,
allowing his hair to sink slightly in front of his eyes because of
its' length.</P><P>His face had lost all of the
previous baby fat that it once had...now sharp features adorned his
face giving Naruto a much more mature look, the whiskers on each
cheek only darkened with age and grew wider, giving off a animalistic
look that basically made the female population salivate.</P><P>Jiraiya smirked when he remembered
one instance when a passion crazed waitress practically threw herself
at Naruto causing a very amusing situation to arise.</P><P>Besides Naruto's new appearance,
the blonde haired youth held himself more gracefully,then he did when
he was younger, while he still had almost unlimited energy, it was
more subdued, but could still be seen swirling just underneath the
surface.</P><P>"Kid...your going to make their
mouths drop to the floor."</P><P>The Toad Sannin took great pride
about the strong Shinobi that Naruto had become, a strength that
would only continue to grow and flourish.</P><P>Naruto didn't say anything instead
he gave a trade-mark 'fox' grin, and started running towards Konoha.</P><P>'That kid will stir up
some trouble in the female population, that's for sure' Jiraiya
thought to himself as he jumped to catch up to Naruto.</P><P>Tsunade hated
paperwork...she quickly found it to be the bane of a Hokage's
existence, she would give her life to the people of the Konoha, but
if the asked her to sign one more damn piece of paper she was serious
considering killing everyone in the village...of course that would
result in...more paperwork. So with a heavy sigh and a glance around
her office Tsunade stood up from here chair walked over to one of the
book shelves that lined the wall. Pulling out a thick leather-bound
book, she reached into the book shelf and gave a sharp tap to the
wall behind where the book was placed. With a slight 'thud' a portion
of the wall fell away to reveal a bottle of fine sake and a large
saucer.</P><P>She gave the office
another quick once-over before she pulled out both items and placed
the wall panel back in place along with the book before shuffling
over to her desk and pouring out some of her 'guilty pleasure'.
Taking a slow sip of the slightly sweet beverage, she relished the
flavor before skipping the saucer altogether. Tipping her head back
she took a long draft before setting the bottle back on the desk in
front of her...or at lest she would have if not for the office door
opening and a dark haired women stepping into the room.</P><P>Both occupants looked
at each other for a full minute, Tsunade still holding the sake
bottle to her lips</P><P>"Tsunade-sama!"
Shizune hissed at the busty blonde sitting at the desk in front of
her. "Your not drinking instead of doing paperwork again, are you?"
she scolded, narrowing her eyes.</P><P>Tsunade paled, she the
Godaime Hokage, one of the legendary Sannin, and this woman's
superior actually began to wave her hands in front of her body as if
trying to ward off the younger woman.</P><P>"Sh-Shizune."
Tsunade stuttered. "I...ah...well you see I finished my paperwork
of the day and j-just thought that ma-maybe I could have a l-little
break thats all..." as she finished speaking her mind was already
forming different punishments that the dark haired woman would force
upon her.</P><P>Her reaction was
brought on because her apprentice and 'sister' held paperwork in her
hands and as usual she may be Hokage but those who hold paperwork are
god, or in this case the devil.</P><P>Shizune narrowed her
eyes further making them into slits as she scrutinized the woman
sitting in front of her before seeing that her desk was indeed empty.
Which caused her to narrow her eyes further, if that was even
possible.</P><P>"You didn't burn them
like last time did you?" She asked sniffing the air for the aroma
of burnt paper.</P><P>"No, I actually just
finished the last one for once." Tsunade replied gaining back her
courage.</P><P>Shizune opened her
mouth to say something, but was interrupted when a blonde haired
figure seemingly materialized out of thin air in front of them.</P><P>"Obaa-chan!" the
figure cried out before jumping over the desk grabbing the blonde
haired Hokage and embracing her causing them both to fall to the
ground with a crash.</P><P>"Tsunade-sama!"
Shizune yelled dropping her paper work running over to where both
blondes fell, getting into a fighting stance.</P><P>What she saw when she
reached her destination however caused her to stop for a moment and
ask herself if what she was seeing was real. The previously unknown
figure was hugging her 'sister' rubbing his, yes his, cheek against
hers while muttering "Obaa-chan" over and over again.</P><P>She shook the sight off
before slipping back into a fighting stance.</P><P>"Release Tsunade-sama
or else." she threatened.</P><P>Before she could move,
she to found herself wrapped into an embrace by the same offender.</P><P>"Shizune-neechan."
the figure said. "Hmm... somehow I always remember that you were
taller."</P><P>Again before she could
do anything she was released and the mysterious blonde was helping
the Hokage to her feet.</P><P>"Somehow I kinda
figured that he would do something like this."</P><P>Both women looked at
the source of the sound to see Jiraiya leaning on the doorway with a
smile on his face.</P><P>Callings of Jiraiya-san
and sama reached his ears, causing him to smile even more. "What I
told you we'd be back in three years right." he said</P><P>'Wait if he's here than
that means...' both women's thoughts followed as they turned back to
the previously unknown male.</P><P>Sitting it the Hokage's
chair leaning back , letting he's feet rest on the desk in front of
him was none other than their lovable ball of energy.</P><P>"So Obaa-chan,
Shizune-neechan...you miss me much"</P><P>Both women were stunned
into silence before Tsunade recovered first.</P><P>"Naruto!" she
yelled reaching back and hitting him in the head naturally causing
the offending appendage to snap forward and collide with the desk
ahead of him.</P><P>When the said blue-eyed
young man's painful cries subsided Tsunade grabbed him roughly before
pulling him into another heart-felt hug, soon to be joined by
Shizune.</P><P>"Of course we've
missed you." they both said. "Here." Tsunade replied before
pushing Naruto to an arms length away. "Let me get a good look at
you."</P><P>What she saw...in
accordance to Jiraiya's estimation...made her jaw drop.</P><P>The first thing she
noticed was that...she didn't need to look down, in fact she had to
look up. What she saw there literally took her breath away. Handsome
features, strong rugged body, tanned skin, and bright blonde hair
that, when added altogether made her go weak in the knees. Her
'little brother' had grown into a handsome...scratch that...drop dead
gorgeous young man. She looked over to Shizune and wasn't surprised
at all when she noticed the blush that was creeping onto her face,
noting that hers probably held the same thing...which embarrassed her
more.</P><P>Jiraiya noticing both
the stunned visages and furious blushes broke out into stomach
wrenching laughter.</P><P>"See, I told you
brat, their jaws would hit the floor." Jiraiya said in between fits
of laughter.</P><P>Reaching up to scratch
the back of his head Naruto gave a 'fox' grin while saying. "I
guess you were right Ero-Sennin."</P><P>"Stop calling me that
brat!" was the only reply he received back.</P><P>Still slightly dazed
Tsunade turned away for Naruto to face her one-time teammate. She
looked at him before looking back a Naruto and turning to Jiraiya
with a look that clearly said 'What the hell!?'</P><P>This caused the said
Toad Sannin to fall into fits of laughter again.</P><P>"What?" was the
only reply that came to her silent question from the man.</P><P>Schooling her features
back into what a Hokage should look like Tsunade asked. "So how did
it go?"</P><P>Almost instantly
Jiraiya became serious. "Well for the most part it went just
fine..."</P><P>Tsunade narrowed her
eyes at the term 'most part'</P><P>"...it wasn't until
we got into the end of the second year that things became a bit of a
problem."</P><P>"What do you mean."
Tsunade growled.</P><P>"Well as you noticed
Naruto's looks here kept attracting attention (Tsunade and Shizune
blushed again) normally I wouldn't care but it seems that Akatsuki
got wind of it. We were in the Sand when we crossed paths with Kisame
and the older Uchiha. Naturally a fight broke out."</P><P>"What happen?"</P><P>As if to answer the
question a metallic 'clang' was heard throughout the room. Looking
over Tsunade saw the two familiar silver and red rings that Naruto
dropped onto the desk, beside her Shizune gasped.</P><P>"The fish-face
bastard got me good and I went down. Next time I woke up Naruto was
lying in the middle what was left of them."</P><P>"Are you sure it was
them?" Shizune asked, it wouldn't have been the first time the two
S-classed nuke-nin had faked their deaths to throw off pursuits.</P><P>"Can't really answer
that."</P><P>"Why not?"</P><P>Jiraiya's face crossed
with a sick look before replying. "There weren't big enough pieces.
However I pretty sure that it was them."</P><P>Tsunade turned to
Naruto and asked. "What happened?"</P><P>"I don't know."</P><P>"What do you mean you
don't know? Did you kill them?"</P><P>Naruto looked out the
window towards the village before answering</P><P>"I can't say, when I
saw Ero-Sennin drop I just lost it, next thing I know I'm in Gaara's
house strapped to medical equipment."</P><P>"Gaara as in the
Kazekage Gaara?" Shizune asked only have Naruto nod in
confirmation.</P><P>"So neither of you
know what happened" the female Hokage said looking between the two.</P><P>"No, I think I know
what went on after I passed out." Jiraiya stated</P><P>"What do you mean?"</P><P>"There was one other
time something like this happened."</P><P>Tsunade seeing Naruto
flinch in her peripheral vision asked "When?"</P><P>"You know Tsunade
there have only been two times in my life that I thought I was going
to die. The first time was when you caught me sneaking a peek at you
in a hot-spring, naturally you beat my within an inch of my life."
Tsunade acquired a embarrassed look on her face, but managed to stay
focused on the man in front of her. "The second time was during a
training session with Naruto, it appears that the angrier that he
gets the more of the Kyuubi's chakra he pulls out. The level of power
is expressed through the number of 'tails' Naruto has.</P><P>Seeing the confusion on
his former teammate's face he explained.</P><P>"When Naruto here..."
Jiraiya began well pointing to the Jinchuuriki in question. "...lets
his emotions get the better of him or is in a life-threatening
position begins to subconsciously or consciously draw on the Kyuubi's
power. Usually this manifests itself in what I call the 'demon cloak'
or a layer of the Kyuubi's chakra covering his body. This along with
other physical changes such as more pronounced canines, red eyes, and
an over all more feral look is only a base state. The more pressed he
becomes along with gaining more pronounced feral features he draws on
more of the Kyuubi's chakra this is when he starts growing 'tails'.
The 'tails' in question are representations of overall how much the
Kyuubi's chakra he's using. Whether it be one, two, three...etc. Now
Naruto can remain in control up to the third tail, however he he
enters the 'fourth tail state' he loses it."</P><P>At this point Jiraiya
started to take off his shirt.</P><P>"Not only does he
lose control but the amount of demonic chakra that he's body is being
subjected to begins to break it down."</P><P>Tsunade being the
legendary med-nin spoke up. "Explain."</P><P>"Basically it begins
to burn him from the outside in, however the Kyuubi's healing factor
keeps it from going too far, so what ends up happening is that is
skin repeatedly gets burned off and regenerated. Blood and skin then
mix with the demon chakra making it a solid color instead of the
usual translucent red.</P><P>Jiraiya finished
removing the clothing covering his chest and Tsunade as well a
Shizune notice the mass of scar tissue that covered the majority of
his chest.</P><P>"Fighting Naruto in
his 'fourth tail state' is the second time I thought I was going to
die. For all intent and purposes he is a miniature Kyuubi." he
finished.</P><P>Tsunade and Shizune
looked over at Naruto only to see him with he's head down and a very
somber look on his face.</P><P>"When Naruto regained
consciousness he had no memory of what transpired. That's why I think
Naruto doesn't remember what happened, because he went into his
'fourth tail state', which also coincides with the amount or rather
'lack of' remains that were left, along with the geographical damage.</P><P>"Geographical
damage..." Shizune started to say before being cut off by Jiraiya.</P><P>"Yeah,
Geographical...let's just say that the Sand now has a good place to
put a lake if get what I'm saying."</P><P>Tsunade began to think
this over before asking. "Is that all?"</P><P>This time Naruto spoke
up. "Actually it just gets weirder and weirder after that."</P>

spoke up. "Actually it just gets weirder and weirder after that."</I></P><P><I>With a confused look
on her face Shizune asked. "What do you mean."</I></P><P>"What I mean is..."
Naruto started before being interrupted</P><P>"What he means is
that's when I entered the stage." A very feminine voice spoke.</P><P>Looking over to a corner of the
office those present noticed a redheaded women looking roughly around
the same age as Naruto. She wore a white kimono top embroidered with
falling leaves the color of those found in the fall, her sleeves went
past her hands which she had folded in front her across her chest.
She was wearing a short kimono-like skirt that matched with the top
reaching about to mid thigh, and you could see small glimpses of the
black spandex shorts underneath. On her feet were long, yet elegant
boots that were also the color white, the cloth portion of them
reached up her legs stopping about three inches from her skirt and
were laced all the way up to the top. Looking back up to the womens
face Tsunade noticed the long rose-red hair that fell to the middle
of her back and alabaster white skin, her face held nothing but soft
feminine features that were sure to draw any man's attention or lust
for that matter, while her body held curves in all the right places,
Tsunade also noticed that the woman she was looking at had quite the
generous bosom which her kimono top covered completely but
accentuated. Tsunade gasped when she was the three tall-tale whisker
marks that adorned the woman's cheeks, giving her an ideal as to the
identity of the female. Looking into the woman's eyes she saw they
were a deep red color, but not in a frightening way it reminded her
more of a certain Gen-jutsu 'mistress' than a cold-blooded demon.</P><P>"You know Tsunade
calling me a cold-blooded demon is not a way to get on my good side."
The female spoke up.</P><P>At Tsunade's shocked
expression she began to laugh, and Tsunade noted it had a melancholy
quality it.</P><P>"Seriously ningen,
are you that surprised that I know your thoughts. Come now, I know
you know who I am or at lest what I am...why don't you just say it
and get it out of the way." the redhead finished.</P><P>"Kyuubi no Kitsune."
Tsunade whispered and when the female in front of her grinned, she
knew she hit her mark.</P><P>"Correct ningen, I am
the Great Kyuubi no Kitsune, although I'm surprised you haven't wet
yourself yet, the ugly one over there did when he first saw me."
Kyuubi replied while pointing a Jiraiya. "Then again I was in my
fox state." she added as an after-thought.</P><P>"Bu-But your a-"
Shizune stuttered.</P><P>"I'm a what? A
female? Just because I'm the strongest demon on your plane of
existence automatically makes me a male? I think not. Look at you."
Kyuubi said as she point to Tsunade "Your supposedly the strongest
of your village and your a female, why should the strongest of the
bijuu be any different? Just look at it from a logical stand point
out of the nine bijuu at lest one of them had to be female besides
that two-tailed pussy-cat."</P><P>Still seeing both
women's shocked she decided to add one last thing. "Besides where
to you think the saying 'hell hath no fury like a woman scorned' came
from? Kyuubi finished with a grin.</P><P>Tsunade quickly looked
back at Naruto. "But the seal..."</P><P>"Relax it's still
there." Naruto replied lifting up his shirt, using chakra to make
to it show.</P><P>All present looked at
the black mass that signified the Fourth's seal on Naruto's hard,
muscled chest. Which caused the females in the room to get a familiar
sensation in their stomach region.</P><P>"So how does that
explain..."</P><P>"I'll answer that."
Kyuubi spoke up,well staring at chest like it was a piece of meat.
Seeing this Naruto pulled his shirt back down and Kyuubi gave a small
pout before turning to face Tsunade. "You see when Naruto uses my
chakra in huge amounts, an example would be when the kit here goes
four tails, it starts to deteriorate the bastards seal. Thankfully it
has deteriorated enough that my consciousness can leave that damn
prison." Kyuubi walked over to Naruto before yanking his shirt back
up. "Look, see this line here and how it just seems to stop."
Kyuubi said running her finger on the line in question causing Naruto
to shudder, which she grinned at. "This represents how much of the
seal has deteriorated, a very very small margin, but at lest I'm out
here now so I'm not complaining."</P><P>'That's it? A quarter
of a line and the fox can be present outside of the seal.' Tsunade
thought as she scrutinized the seal in front of her. Turning to
Jiraiya she asked. "So what does this mean in terms of how much
power the Kyuubi has?" At this the said 'fox' began to growl.</P><P>"As far as I can
tell she has enough materialize herself and enough to protect her
container, so she's more or less just an average high-Chuunin."</P><P>"How dare you call me
'average' you lowly ningen I'll rip the flesh from you body and feed
on the marrow for you bones!" Kyuubi yelled trying to reach the
Toad Sannin, only to be held back by her container. The sight in
itself that the Great Kyuubi no Kitsune was being held back by a
Genin was very amusing to those present...minus the seething demon.</P><P>Tsunade turned walking
over to her desk and grabbed the sake bottle that was still sitting
atop the mahogany piece of furniture finishing it two fast gulps,
which was saying something when you consider that it was more than
half full.</P><P>"She mentioned her
fox form..." Tsunade said.</P><P>"Yeah she can change
into her fox form as well, however it's a smaller version."</P><P>"How small?"
Shizune asked.</P><P>Naruto and Jiraiya
seemed a little hesitant, due to the fact that they kept throwing
glances of towards the Kyuubi, when Tsunade looked over she instantly
knew why. Sitting exactly were the redheaded woman was a moment
earlier was now a small fox now larger than the common house-cat. The
Godaime Hokage stared at the small furry demon for a minute or so
before bursting out in laughter.</P><P>"Jiraiya you pissed
your pants over this...this...plush toy." Tsunade choked.</P><P>Any comment forthcoming
from the Toad Sannin came to a screeching halt, why he and everyone
else in the room was suddenly fighting to breath. Killing intent was
rolling off Kyuubi like waves from a waterfall. Tsunade looked back
towards the 'plush toy' only to come face to face with a very, very
pissed off red-eyed woman.</P><P>"Care to say that
again ningen, go ahead I dare you, it will give me plenty enough
reasons to level this village to the ground."</P><P>All those present in
the room merely watched as the Kyuubi practically stood nose to nose
with Tsunade, praying that she repeat her previous comment. Sensing
none forthcoming though Kyuubi spun away form the blonde Hokage and
walked back over to Naruto where she wrapped her arm's around the
shoulders of her container, while resting her head on his chest
sighing with a bit of contentment.</P><P>Desperately needing a
break from the ensuing madness, which the trio of 'ninja' had thrown
upon her, especially if she were to an inquire as to why the Kyuubi
was acting as she was, Tsunade decided that any more information they
had about how their, or rather Naruto's training went, would have to
wait till tomorrow. Dismissing all present, in an attempt to preserve
her sanity, she walked back over to her desk hazardously before
falling backwards into the soft leather chair that was stationed
behind it.</P><P>'Kami-sama it's going
to get interesting around here' were her last thoughts before passing
out, because the sake she had ingested finally caught up to her.</P><P>After being dismissed
from his Obaa-chan's office Naruto found himself outside the Hokage
mansion thinking about what he was going to do.</P><P>"You could always
stop at that infernal ramen shop." Kyuubi suggested as she was
'causally' draping her arms around him.</P><P>"You mean
Ichiraku's?"</P><P>"Is there anyplace
else?"</P><P>"Yeah right
Ichiraku's the best." Naruto scoffed.</P><P>The walk to the said
ramen shop seemed to take longer than it ever had before, was all
that Naruto thought about for the moment, before coming to the
conclusion that it was probably because the last times he didn't have
a nine-tailed female demon, seemingly glued to his body. When the
blondes home away from home finally came into view, he couldn't
restrain himself any further. Grabbing his host and holding her mesh
against himself he speed down the street completely ignoring Kyuubi's
squeals of surprise and admonishments. Bursting through the
restaurants cloth drapes he found himself staring at Ayame, Old man
Teuchi's daughter.</P><P>"Ayame-neechan!"
Naruto yelled.</P><p align='center'>XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</P><P><B>A.N.-</B> Hiya folks, how
you enjoying the story? I would just like to explain some things
first off, Yes I will explain why Kyuubi is acting like she, yes she,
is. In truth it deals with a few things...a few of them things she
doesn't like and would never admit. Secondly, yes there will be
Naruto x Kyuubi however you, the readers, my have a say in possible
other love interests n Naruto's life, my only stipulation is that
they be female. Well that's it for now if you have questions voice
them.</P><P>Oh almost forgot Naruto is

<br><br><h3>Chapter 3</h3><hr><br><P><I>After being
dismissed from his Obaa-chan's office Naruto found himself outside
the Hokage mansion thinking about what he going to do. </I></P><P>"<I>You could always
stop at that infernal ramen shop." Kyuubi suggested as she was
'causally' draping her arms around him.</I></P><P>"<I>You mean
Ichiraku's?"</I></P><P>"<I>Is there anyplace
else?" </I></P><P>"<I>Yeah right

that Naruto thought about for the moment, before coming to the
conclusion that it was probably because the last times he didn't have
a nine-tailed female demon, seemingly glued to his body. When the
blonde's home away from home finally came into view, he couldn't
restrain himself any further. Grabbing his host and holding her mesh
against himself he speed down the street completely ignoring Kyuubi's
squeals of surprise and admonishments. Bursting through the
restaurants cloth drapes he found himself staring at Ayame, Old man
Teuchi's daughter. </I></P><P>"<I>Ayame-neechan!"
Naruto yelled. </I></P><P>The girl in question
looked up from her work to take notice of their new customer, when
she did however Ayame found herself gripping the counter in an
attempt to keep herself from melting there on the spot.</P><P>"A-ah do I know
yo-you?" she stuttered out</P><P>Naruto smirked and
pointed to the whisker-like marks that adorned his cheeks, when Ayame
noticed what he was pointing at, instantly she knew who it was after
all who had marks like that?</P><P>"Na-Naruto!"</P><P>"Yup and to start off
I'll have a two miso and a pork Ayame-neechan." looking over to
Kyuubi he asked "What do you want?"</P><P>It was then that the
ramen girl noticed he had company...very, very beautiful company.</P><P>"I'll have a miso as
well Naruto-kun." very pretty girl next to Naruto spoke up before
wrapping her arm around his and pulling him close. Ayame didn't know
why but that single action caused a tightening in her chest.</P><P>"Three miso and a
pork coming right up."</P><P>Soon after Naruto and
Kyuubi were staring at the large bowls of noodles sitting in front of
them with great...and hungry interest. With a quick thanks they both
dug in.</P><P>"I forgot how good
this tasted!" Naruto exclaimed with tears in his eyes, which
resulted in Kyuubi rolling her eyes and a small blush adorning
Ayame's face.</P><P>Giving the counter a
quick once over, Ayame took her time going over Naruto's
face...truthfully she was trying her best not to develop a 'fan-girl'
attachment to the boy...no young man in front of her. Turning her
gaze over to his companion, Ayame couldn't but help become a little
jealous...the girl was absolutely gorgeous, everything about her was
perfect, as if someone took perfection and embodied it within the
woman sitting in front of her. Ayame couldn't help herself she needed
to know who this woman was and how she was attached to Naruto.</P><P>"Ano...Miss...?"
Ayame asked Kyuubi with a questioning look on her face.</P><P>Kyuubi gazed up form
her bowl to look at the young woman in front of her, noticing the
questioning look on her face, causing her to smirk, she knew what was
this young woman was doing.</P><P>"Monogatari,
Kitsune." Kyuubi replied resulting in Naruto choking on his
noodles.</P><P>"Kitsune?" asked
Ayame.</P><P>"My parents named me
it because they said even right after I was born I had a cute,
mischievous look about me, hence 'Kitsune'.</P><P>Ayame giving Kyuubi a
appraising look accepted in at face value, 'she certainly looks
mischievous' Ayame thought noticing Kyuubi...or rather Kitsune's
smirk.</P><P>"Well
Kitsune-chan...you don't mind if I call you that do you?" Ayame
asked only continuing when the female in question nodded her head.
"May I ask how you know Naruto and where you meet him?"</P><P>Naruto looked over at
his 'inner demon' wondering what she was going to say.</P><P>"Well I guess we
meet...what about a year ago?" Kyuubi said looking at Naruto for
confirmation. "I came across Naruto-kun badly injured and bleeding
heavily, and I took it upon myself to take him into my bosom and help
in back to his feet."</P><P>"How come your still
with him then?"</P><P>"Well you see
Naruto-kun he was so grateful he repaid me in the only way he could
think of...and I must tell you that was exactly how I wanted to lose
my maidenhood. Well as you can guess, this of course ruined me for
any other male in marriage, so I took it upon myself to become his
fiance and wait for the day we can meet again...in the marriage bed."
Kyuubi finished, taking great amusement from the reactions her
statement caused.</P><P>Ayame had turned almost
'lobster-red' looking between Kyuubi and Naruto. The named male was
almost unconscious due to lake of oxygen, when he 'inhaled' some of
his ramen in complete surprise and horror. Of course both these
reactions were expected, what wasn't however was the almost anguished
scream followed soon after by the sound of a body hitting the dirt,
when Ayame and the other turned around they met the limp body of the
Hyuga Hinata...what was strange...at lest to Naruto was the
'apple-red' blush coating her face.</P><P>However in five minutes
time the young heiress was 'back on her feet', or at lest conscious.</P><P>"Na-Naruto...your...en-engaged?" the young heiress managed to
say.</P><P>Kyuubi, not being able
to help herself decided to answer her.</P><P>"Well you see..."
Naruto began before quickly being interrupted by his 'demon'.</P><P>"Well you see
Hinata-chan, he isn't only engaged, he's...I'm we're 'expecting' as
well." Kyuubi said while draping her arms around Naruto's
shoulder's and guiding his hand to her stomach, rubbing it in a
gentle fashion.</P><P>"Na-Na-Naruto's...ex-expecting..." Hinata stuttered, before
releasing a loud "No!" and falling back into oblivion, oddly
followed soon after by Ayame and even Naruto himself.</P><P>"I still got it..."</P><P>When the group finally
reached the land of the 'living' again, they each were silent, and of
course each had a furious blush upon their cheeks.</P><P>"Ayame-neechan."
Naruto spoke.</P><P>"H-Hai Naruto-kun?"</P><P>"How much will the
ramen be, or is it the same as always?"</P><P>"Don't wo-worry about
it Naruto-kun it's on the house."Ayame said</P><P>"Thanks so much
Ayame-chan!" Kyuubi said as she grabbed Naruto and started
sprinting towards his apartment.</P><P>"Your welcome
Kitsune-chan..."</P><P>When Naruto and his
'fiance' were out of view Ayame went over to gentle shake Hinata
awake, all the while thinking about what Kyuubi or in her case
Kitsune had said about her and Naruto.</P><P>It took Kyuubi and
Naruto only seven minutes to reach his apartment building, and soon
they were both inside. Everything was exactly how he left it, what
was surprising though was the fact that there was no dust. "Obaa-chan
must have had someone come every once and a while and clean the
place' Naruto thought as he threw his pack down and unzipped his
sweater a bit. He walked into the kitchen and took a quick peek into
the fridge as Kyuubi was stripping her boots off., what he noticed
was that the fridge was stacked with food with a note tapped to the
side of a milk carton, taking the carton in question out and pouring
two glasses, before removing the note and reading it.</P><P><I>Naruto-kun</I></P><P><I>As you have no doubt
noticed, Tsunade-sama had me come in every once and while to give the
place a good dusting, I also have stocked the fridge and your pantry
with food...because you need proper nutrition being a growing young
man, and although you love it, ramen will not do...not to mention I
doubt that Kyuubi-san will want to eat it all the time as well. Enjoy
the food, and Tsunade-sama wishes to see you tomorrow at two o'clock
ok?</I></P><P><I>Take care or
yourself,</I></P><P><I>Shizune-neechan</I></P><P>Smiling
at the contents Naruto gentle set it down on the table, before
turning to Kyuubi and handing her the extra glass of milk he pored,
while finishing off his own in two large 'gulps' he watched as Kyuubi
took her's and licked the milk twice much like a cat or rather a fox
would before bringing it up to her lips and drinking form it.</P><P>"You it's kinda strange when you do that."</P><P>"Well sorry but I'm fighting against a couple thousand years for
instinct here, so get used to it."</P><P>He
comment caused Naruto to laugh as he started walking down the hall
removing his sweater and numerous belts, setting them aside as he
neared the bathroom.</P><P>"I
gonna take a bath or do you wanna go first." he said as he turned
around to face Kyuubi, which resulted in he face flushing.</P><P>"Ahh..why don't you go first, I'll just get the guest bedroom how I
want it in the mean time."</P><P>"Suite
yourself." Naruto replied back before walking into the bathroom and
closing the door, not before, however a pair of pants and boxers
found there way into the hall.</P><P><B>A.N.-</B>
Yeah I know how long it's been since the last update, the reason for
this was I was seriously think over whether or not this will be a
harem, and I have concluded that it will not be one, however it will
have some harem elements in it. This update incidentally was shorter
than the other two for this reason as well, but next week it will be
longer, I can promise that. Next Chapter will delve more deeply into
Naruto's and Kyuubi's 'relationship' and how they both feel about
present circumstances, more so now that Kyuubi has people believing
Naruto is engaged and 'expecting' which will of course bring some
unusual reactions about...Anyway let me know how you think the story
is so-far and how it is progressing. Until next time.</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 4</h3><hr><br><P>It
was dark before Tsunade awoke from her alcohol induced slumber, she
noticed that the lights of her office were switched off, which she
accounted to Shizune's doing. Turning her chair around she faced the
large window that was situated behind her, to over-look the city.
Small lights glittered about at random intervals often marking the
entrance to some establishment, or a street lamp which were few in
number but mostly centered around the Hokage administration building,
where she herself was now residing. A small set of 'taps' alerted her
that she would be expecting company very soon as, not but a moment
later Jiraiya's face appeared on the other side of the glass, upside
down. Sighing Tsunade stood up and walked over to open the window.</P><P>"So
you here to tell me the full story now?" Jiraiya nodded in response
before sliding into the room and sitting in the seat opposite the
Hokage's own, passing Tsunade with a solemn look etched into his
features.</P><P>"Alright spill." Tsunade said while sitting at her desk, resting
her chin on her hands, as she held them in front of her.</P><P>"You want the good news or the bad news?"</P><P>"There's good news?"</P><P>Despite himself the Toad Sannin cracked a small smile. "Depends on
how you look at it."</P><P>"Let's hear the bad news first."</P><P>Tsunade watched as the her former teammate seemed to struggle, as if
trying to decide where to start. It was another twenty or so seconds
before he said anything.</P><P>"From what my sources say the Akatsuki is giving up on Naruto."</P><P>"I
thought I told you to give me the bad news first."</P><P>"That is bad news, well some of it."</P><P>"How's that bad, isn't that what we want?" Tsunade questioned.</P><P>"Yes, and no. It's true that we want the Akatsuki to stop going
after Naruto, that's not exactly what I said, I said their 'giving up
on Naruto', not 'their going to stop coming for him." When Jiraiya
noticed Tsunade's questioning gaze he told it to her straight. "All
of the Akatsuki members are being withdrawn from their activities and
in three months time all of them, with the exception of Itachi, and
Kisame because they're dead, are going after Naruto; not to
capture...but to kill."</P><P>The
air in her office seemed to chill suddenly, possibly caused by the
gust of wind that filtered through the open window behind her, or
more probably it was brought about by what her teammate and friend
just said. Three months, just three months and the 'whole' of
Akatsuki were coming to kill Naruto, her lovable ball of energy, the
number one unpredictable ninja of Konoha, and her pseudo-son...in
just three short months.</P><P>"Does Naruto know?" the white haired Sannin's silence made than
an acceptable answer.</P><P>"Why the hell not!" Tsunade roared in Jiraiya face, slamming her
hand on the desk, the crack being brought into existence by her
actions, spoke louder than her yell as to how upset she was.</P><P>"Could you tell him he was going to die in three months?"</P><P>"He
won't die, I'll be hellbent on even letting one of those bastards
touch him. Even if I have to fight them myself."</P><P>"I
wouldn't doubt it but that's just that, it would be what you, me and
a few others. More troubling would be if the Council found out about
this, which is bound to happen sooner or later and their reactions,
which mostly likely will border on abandoning him to the the Akatsuki
just so they didn't have to get their own hands dirty, plus it gets
rid of something they've been not to pleased with being associated
with..."</P><P>"Naruto..." Tsunade said gritting her teeth, the Council, most of
them were nothing more than dried up husks of former ninja, seeking
nothing more than making sure they looked more important then they
really where, and some where just power-hungry parasites. 'Scratch
that parasites usually leave the host when their environment is in
danger.' Tsunade thought as the face of Danzo came to mind, while
Homura and Sarutobi's other teammate followed shortly after. Other
than that, the rest of the Council was made up of 'privileged'
citizens; otherwise know as stuck-up Naruto-haters seeing him as
nothing more than the Kyuubi reborn.</P><P>Coming out of her retrospective reprieve Tsunade glanced in Jiraiya's
general direction, before thinking of something.</P><P>"You have a plan don't you?"</P><P>It
wasn't really a question.</P><P>"Naruto has to die...that's the only thing I can think of."
Jiraiya said remorsefully</P><P>If
anyone else had suggested such a thing, Tsunade would have
undoubtedly put them through a wall. The simple fact that the Toad
Sannin was still sitting somewhat comfortably in his chair was proof
of how much the fifth Hokage trusted him.</P><P>"What are you thinking?" She asked.</P><P>"Let everyone think an accident happened, then we stick him in
hiding. I know for a fact that Minato...he's father's 'secret'
training hideout is still up and running. Let him sit pretty and
train for a bit more until we know without fail that he will be able
to survive; then miraculously he makes hes way back to the center
stage."</P><P>A
pregnant pause followed after Jiraiya finished, the open admission to
his heritage somehow seemed to call for it.</P><P>"Do
you think Kushina would be angry at us?" Tsunade asked, thoughts of
the beautiful red-haired woman that mothered Naruto floated through
her mind.</P><P>In
spite of the seriousness of the question the red-clad Sannin smirked.
"You're scared she'd make you give up sake and gambling again."</P><P>Memories of said woman doing just that filtered through her brain
followed shortly after by the memory of Tsunade in a drunken stupor,
bargaining in on Kushina and Minato during their 'bonding time' and
incurring the wrath of the Whirlpool native woman's ire.</P><P>To
this day Kushina is the only woman <I>ever </I>to drag her by the
hair and force-feed, the now fifth Hokage copious amounts of Siberian
Ink-Cap mushrooms, just to ensure that she had the hang-over form
hell the next morning...which Tsunade did...she drank a lot of sake.</P><P>The
laugh they both shared was quickly over and Tsunade re-affirmed her
question.</P><P>"In
a honesty I can't say Kushina was always a hard one to predict."
Jiraiya said reverently.</P><P>"Just like Naruto..."</P><P>"Yeah just like Naruto."</P><P>Suddenly Jiraiya stood up and quickly walked over to her bookcase.</P><P>"What are you-" his once-time teammate began to ask as he took a
familiar leather-bound book out and set aside before tapping the wall
in a all to familiar place, knocking away the panel covering her
'secret stash' and grabbing another big bottle before replacing the
panel and book.<BR>"We both need this." he said answering
Tsunade's silent question, before returning to his seat and pulling
out his own saucer to accompany her own resting next to the empty and
up-turned sake bottle on her desk.</P><P>As
her former teammate silently poured them both a drink, a few more
questions rose to the surface of her awareness, mainly to do with
'another redhead'.</P><P>"What about the Kyuubi?"</P><P>"Where to start." he exclaimed with a 'huff'</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>The
hot water currently running down his body did wonders on the numerous
sore muscles he had throughout his body. Even on the day of their
return Ero-Sennin made him train, given Kyuubi's healing factor the
fact that he's body still ached spoke volumes about the intensity of
the workouts. Not that he minded, far from it; but it was so sudden
it was only a few weeks ago that Jiraiya had been somewhat lax in his
training. Whatever caused the change most have been important, He
wasn't as stupid as everyone thought he was, he noticed things as
well, whether or not he acted upon then was an entirely different
matter.</P><P>Before Naruto could think more on that subject the melancholy voice
of his 'roommate' found it's way to his ears through the door.</P><P>"Hurry up in there, maybe I wanna take a shower to you know."</P><P>Naruto didn't bother to answer, after a minute or so he heard her
voice again.</P><P>"Leave it alone, it'll grow just give it time."</P><P>That got a rise out of him.</P><P>"Shut up you damn fox!" Naruto bellowed form the shower, only to
greeted by the mad cackling of Kyuubi.</P><P>She
was another 'problem', at first he outright hated her with a passion,
and she knew it. Over time though and with her insistent attempts to
make things better he had grown a little fond of his red-headed
captive, he still disliked Kyuubi; mainly do to the fact that she
always pushed his buttons, but there were quite a few times she
showed him her 'other side' the wise, thousands of years old side.
Her true self. After all Naruto knew the way Kyuubi acted out in
public was a mask spawned from the insecurity of being so weak, just
as he's mask was spawned form facing the villager's hate, abuse and
violence. It was a mask, a mask that was somehow comfortable to hide
behind. Even in spite of the pain one felt after removing it in the
privacy of their home.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>"The beginning would be nice." Tsunade stated while finishing off
her saucer of sake.</P><P>"That's easier to say than to actually do."</P><P>Not
bothering with speaking Tsunade snatched the sake bottle out of
Jiraiya's grasp, silently telling him he wouldn't be getting anymore
until he's story began.</P><P>Sighing in resignation he spoke.</P><P>"Well I wasn't there when she decided to make her first appearance,
so you'll have to ask Naruto about it. When I came back though, you
could tell something went down. I'd never seen Naruto like that
before, and so far, I've yet to see him like that again."</P><P>The
Toad Sannin paused in his speech to snake the sake bottle out of
Tsunade's hands and poured himself a drink while continuing on with
his monologue.</P><P>"I
first saw 'her' about two weeks after the whole Itachi and Kisame
'incident'."</P><P>Unable to help herself Tsunade sneered.</P><P>"Is this when you pissed your self over a 'plush toy'?" she
asked.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>In
the confines of her 'prisons' apartment Kyuubi suddenly sneezed. 'I
must rend someone's flesh' she thought while lounging lazily on one
of the two small couches that provided the sitting space in his
'living-room'. Despite the fact that Naruto had yet to get out of the
shower she was in a jovial mood. This however didn't last as her
thoughts gradually steered towards the blonde youth. Kyuubi would
whole-heartedly agree that they didn't hit it off as best as they
could; in the seal and out. After all how could they, she was the
reason he was hated and scorned in his home village and for the
better part of twelve years treated like trash...perhaps more
appropriately he was treated <I>lower </I>than trash. As for her he
was the prison that contained her, the sole person preventing her
from the freedom she so desired. Although Naruto wasn't really to
blame, she just took it out on him when they first met and for some
time after. Whom her ire was really directed at was the other
blonde-haired bastard that sealed her in the first place.</P><P>Kyuubi's thoughts were interrupted when the sound of Naruto turning
off the water and stepping out reached her ears. All to soon the
bathroom door opened exposing a pajama clad Naruto standing in the
doorway, steam rolling into the hallway from behind him like a
passing cloud. 'Wait where'd the pajama's come from?' she wondered.</P><P>Somehow understanding Kyuubi's internal thoughts Naruto held up the
scroll he took out of one of many pouches that littered his belts.</P><P>'He
grabbed one without me noticing...' soon her thoughts ran rampant on
what this information might mean, after all it's not everyday she
missed something like this especially when she was looking right at
him when he dropped his belts on the floor.</P><P>"Hey Kyuubi?"</P><P>"Yes..." she answered in spite of herself, and her misplaced
dislike she was still fond of him. He grew on her over the past year
or so they had been together, and to some points earned her respect.</P><P>"There's something I wanna talk to you about."</P><P>"Which is?"</P><P>"Have you noticed Ero-Sennin acting a little off lately?"</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>The
white-haired man in front of her damn near growled at her words,
before muttering something along the lines of "damn foxes" under
his breath.</P><P>"Yeah that would be it." He said while gritting his teeth.</P><P>"Alright so what happened besides you pissing yourself?" Tsunade
said clutching her stomach as laughter racked her body.</P><P>"We
were attacked, by two Jonin squads of stone nin who were ordered to
see if the rumors were true that I was in area, they still haven't
given up on the whole 'Third Great Shinobi War'. If I was alone this
wouldn't have been a problem but at this Naruto was still recovering
from the injuries he sustained while in the 'Fourth Tail State' and
was incapacitated at this point."</P><P>Before he could say more Tsunade cut him off.</P><P>"What do you mean he was incapacitated from his injuries, with the
Kyuubi's healing factor he should have healed at a much faster
rate..." She said before finishing with "Just how injured was
he?"</P><P>If
there was list of questions Jiraiya never wanted to not answer this
one would be damn near the top of that list.</P><P>"He
was injured pretty bad" he answered ambiguously.</P><P>"Jiraiya..!"</P><P>"Ok, ok " the Toad Sannin said while holding up his hands in a
defensive manor. "The chakra cloak as I've said burnt off his skin
however I didn't mention it was to the point that his musculature was
exposed."</P><P>Somewhere in Tsunade's head a vein burst.</P><P><B>A.N.-
</B>Yeah I know late, but with
school and all...you know. This update is being split into two parts
for the purpose of there are things I wanna explain. In regards to
this next chapter we'll delve further into Kyuubi and Naruto's
relationship, and the whole Jiraiya and Tsunade 'thing'. Something
else I'd like to say is that I made up a kind of 'due date' schedule
for my updates, I will be posting this on my Author's page so if you
wanna know when the next part is coming out just look it up.</P><P>Oh
and as an afterthought to answer <B>Nickeledwards </B>question
a Harem involves one person (usually male) surrounded by those of the
opposite sex, and as a cause of that usually relationships with one
or more of the (in this case) girls transpire. However this could
also be vise-versa...a good example would be something like "<I>Love
Hina</I>".</P><P>It's not really a question but more
of a misunderstanding is that Kyuubi and Naruto <B>Haven't</B> 'done anything' at this point. Kyuubi was just being the mischievous
'little' vixen she is when she mentioned they partook in the
pleasures of the flesh...and her being subsequently pregnant. This is
<B>NOT TRUE</B>...at lest
perhaps not yet.</P><P>'Insert evil laughter'</P><P>Until next time let me know what you think of the story ok?</P><P>-Zanaso Clramm-</P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 5</h3><hr><br><P>Kyuubi contemplated Naruto's statement before coming to the
conclusion that he was indeed right, the white-haired pervert had
been acting a little off as of late especially around Naruto.</P><P>"Now that you mention it he has." Kyuubi stated.</P><P>Walking over to the other small couch across from her Naruto bent
down as if to sit before standing up right again, making his way to
the newly stocked fridge. 'Thank you Shizune-neechan' he thought as
he opened it up to take out some fruit.</P><P>"Any ideal as to why?" he asked while debating to himself if he
wanted grapes or an apple.</P><P>"Your guess is as good as mine." Kyuubi answered back. This
wasn't entirely true she held several 'guesses as to why the said man
was acting the way he did, but Naruto didn't need to know this...at
lest not yet.</P><P>"Oh
and grab the grapes for me" she added as an 'afterthought'.</P><P>Grabbing the fruit hes' roommate so desired and an apple for himself
Naruto made his way back to the couch, casually tossing Kyuubi her
fruit.</P><P>"He
didn't start acting this way until he met with 'people' for
'information', you think it as any thing to deal with the Akatsuki?"</P><P>'He's definitely smarter that's for sure' Kyuubi thought to herself
while popping a grape into her waiting maw. 'After all thats along
the lines of what I was thinking.'</P><P>"Who knows, he could have just been peeping on women and suddenly
realized he liked men instead." She joked.</P><P>"What!" Naruto exclaimed. "Ero-Sennin liking men, the end of
the world would come first."</P><P>If
it wasn't for the fact that he had said it in totally conviction
Kyuubi could have laughed.</P><P>"You never know kit, you never know."</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>The
only thing that saved him was the untimely, or in this case timely
sneeze that caused him to duck his head just as the Hokage's fist was
reaching it.</P><P>"He's what was exposed!" Tsunade exploded in rage.</P><P>To
say that the Toad Sannin was counting his lucky stars that he
inadvertently dodged Tsunade's punch was like saying he only 'liked'
the female body. At the same time though Jiraiya was cursing which
ever hottie that mentioned his name, after all now he'd be conscious
for Tsunade's wrath...and he knew her wrath was very, very painful.</P><P>"He's musculature was exposed, and you didn't think of coming
straight back here!" Tsunade questioned.</P><P>"Well to be honest with the healing properties of the fox I thought
he could just sleep it off." As Jiraiya said this he realized his
folly that and the desk being hurtled his way at an alarming pace.</P><P>"Kami-sama." was that he could get out before the desk made
impact with the Sannin knocking him into blissful unconsciousness,
and quite a few ribs out of place.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>"Hey I being serious here you know." Naruto pouted trying to get
at least some reaction from Kyuubi who was currently watching the
television.</P><P>"For Kami's sake what!?" Kyuubi shouted.</P><P>"Shizune-neechan's letter said that Obaa-chan wanted to see me in
the morning what do you think it's for?"</P><P>"Hell if I know, and hell if I give a damn, if your so eager why
don't you plop yourself into bed so morning comes faster."</P><P>Slumping his head in silent defeat, Naruto headed Kyuubi's advice and
headed for his room in the process of doing so he kicked all his
belongs with him into the room before closing the door leaving Kyuubi
to her own devices.</P><P>"Damn Naruto..." Kyuubi whispered under her breath before
changing the channel.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>The
blank ceiling returned Naruto's gaze as he laid in bed staring at it.
Coming back to Konoha held a lot of meaning to him, but it wouldn't
be the same as when he left. It wasn't so much that it changed; more
that he changed. 'I wonder how Sakura-chan is doing?' Naruto thought
absently, watching the moonlight careen through the windows casting
shadows all about.</P><P>Rolling onto his side, away form the windows Naruto closed his eyes.
Ero-Sensei...the way he'd been acting lately bothered him, their
training suddenly picking up even despite Kyuubi emerging form the
seal there had to be some reason and Naruto had a sneaking suspicion
that whatever it was it had to do with the Akatsuki and he himself.
Closing his eyes Naruto decided that whatever it he'd deal with it in
time and until then not worry about.</P><P>Not
long after he wondered into the realm of sleep.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>The
television flashed through image after image, yet even though Kyuubi
was looking at them she saw none of it; instead the image of her
container was flashing through her mind, that and the Akatsuki. She'd
overheard the pervert talking with his so called 'contact' and new
all about what the Akatsuki was planning...three months, thats all
Naruto had to live and her as well.</P><P>'I
hope these people have a plan.' Kyuubi couldn't help but think. Even
though she was out of the seal almost all of her power was stuck
inside of Naruto, even worse she couldn't use any of it with out
Naruto's permission and even then what she had access to was a
penitence sum.</P><P>The
bleak prospect that she, the Great Nine-tailed Fox might actually be
taken and used for some insane experiment did not make her feel warm
inside at all. Turning off the t.v., Kyuubi sat in silence watching
moonlight fall through the windows...she had to much to do, so much
she had to say and three months was nowhere near enough. Redemption
was seriously out of place now, and Kyuubi did the only thing she
could...she cried.</P><P><B>A.N.-</B>
Here's the latest bit, yeah I know it's short, and I know it's been
forever, but seriously I'm not doing this on purpose it's been kinda
hectic my life. Another reason is that because I haven't been writing
this story in a while I've kinda lost the feel for it, so if this
chapter feel somewhat out of place...sorry, I will try and get back
'in the groove' as fast as I can other than that let me know what you
think ok?</P><P>Zanaso Clramm</P><P><B>Naruto

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P>Sunlight flooded into the room, waking Naruto from his slumber.
Sitting up Naruto rubbed his sleep weary eyes in an attempt to chase
to dreams away, even if they were more comforting.</P><P>"I
gotta see Obaa-chan today." he mumbled getting out of bed; heading
to the bathroom, where he went about his morning ritual.</P><P>After brushing his teeth Naruto made his way to the kitchen area,
when he passed through the living room however he stopped. Laying
curled up on the couch was Kyuubi, huffing to himself Naruto walked
over to where she lay and gently shook her awake.</P><P>"What do you want?" an irritated Kyuubi asked opening an eye to
see who would dare bother her sleep.</P><P>"I
was about to make breakfast you might as well eat to right?"</P><P>Looking down at his 'captive' the fact that her eyes were bloodshot
and extremely puffy caught him off guard and before he could stop
himself he spoke out.</P><P>"Kyuubi, have you...have you been crying?" saying it out-loud
made it seem even less believable.</P><P>"No, I got something in my eye and...what's matter to you anyways!"
Kyuubi growled, standing up trying to look intimidating, the fact
that she was now shorter than Naruto helped hinder her progress
however.</P><P>"I
don't care, forget it make you own damn breakfast!" Naruto yelled
back, towering over Kyuubi whom was inwardly seething at the height
difference.</P><P>"Fine I will, and It'll be a hell of a lot better than yours!"</P><P>"Like hell you damn fox!"</P><P>With that both walked determinedly into the kitchen where they set
about outdoing the others in making breakfast. Naruto despite
everyones opinion in thinking he could only make ramen, made a
terrific batch of omelets and toast. Kyuubi though was having a hard
time, cooking wasn't really her best skill, do to being a fox and
all; this mixed with the notion that she didn't know how to use any
of the kitchen appliances made for a particularly messy combination.</P><P>Sitting at the small table that graced his kitchen, Naruto laughed at
Kyuubi's progress. Sticky batter clung to her frame and hair, milk
soaked her clothes and pancake powder littered her face.</P><P>"You think this is funny don't you!"</P><P>"You bet your ass I do." Naruto said a smirk on his lips.</P><P>"Fine!" Walking with a purpose in mind Kyuubi quickly crossed the
kitchen snatched Naruto's plate away and in a rather animalistic way
began devouring the plates contents.</P><P>"Hey that's mine!"</P><P>"Mmm, tastes good to."</P><P>Lunging across the table Naruto grabbed Kyuubi by the shoulder's and
pulled her back in an attempt to get his plate away, which he failed
to do. What he did manager was to bring both of them to the floor and
after a brief struggle Kyuubi, using her flexibility for leverage
managed to pin him.</P><P>"Get off me."</P><P>"Not until you say your sorry for making fun of me." Kyuubi
growled into the back of his neck.</P><P>"No!"</P><P>"I
won't get off then."</P><P>"Like hell you won't." Naruto attempted to throw Kyuubi form off
his back, but with her balance he only ended up bruising his hips.</P><P>"Seriously get off my hips hurt."</P><P>"Shut up and take it like a man!"</P><P>Anything Naruto was going to say stopped when a large 'bang' came
from his front door.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Hinata Hyuga was having mixed feelings about Naruto coming back. On
one hand she loved that he was back and that she would get to see him
after he went away for so long, but on the other hand he brought a
girl...a very pretty girl back with him, that was claiming to be
bearing his child. What could this mean for her, he was her life her
inspiration and her future; or at least thats what she thought until
recently. Deciding that the matter had to be answered in one way or
another Hinata headed for Naruto's apartment.</P><P>It
didn't take her long to reach her destination due to the fact that
she knew how to get there from any where in the village she quickly
made her way up the steps to his door.</P><P>"No!" A voice yelled out one she immediately recognized as
Naruto's.</P><P>His
voice was drowned out by an even louder</P><P>"I
won't get off then." a female voice said, the same one from
yesterday.</P><P>All
thought process just about stopped for Hinata, but oddly enough she
somehow made it to his door.</P><P>"Like hell you won't." Naruto could be heard saying with a series
of grunts soon following.</P><P>"Seriously get off my hips hurt."</P><P>The
young Hyuga's imagination spun out of control making up a situation
where such words and noises would make sense, what she got was a
sweaty Naruto engaged in vigorous activity, one that made her knees
weak.</P><P>"Shut up and take it like a man!"</P><P>When Hinata heard that she lost it and gracefully, or rather not so
gracefully collided with the door ushering unconsciousness.</P><P><B>A.N.-
</B>So that's the next part,
nothing like a good old breakfast 'cook off' huh, anyways I have
posting dates listed on my profile so if you wanna know when the next
part it coming out just look it up. For your questions</P><P><B>Starfire99</B>,
The romance portion of this story will take a bit to get into, for
obvious reasons. That and I like to make things a realistic as I can,
so Naruto and Kyuubi will have to have certain things happen to set
them up for a romance and then even more things to happen to make it
real. Hopefully this answers your 'question'.</P><P>Other than that I hope you liked the chapter and let me know
what you think of it.</P><P>Zanaso Clramm</P>

<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P>Naruto and Kyuubi both respectfully looked at the door where a large
'bang' just originated from.</P><P>"Did you hear that?" questioned Naruto.</P><P>Nodding her head in agreement Kyuubi stood up from Naruto and headed
towards the door, taking every precaution. Naruto followed behind her
doing the same, his trust in the villagers was dulled somewhat when
he was on his trip with Jiraiya. Pulling a kunai from his side one of
his sleeves he stood to the side of the door while Kyuubi extended
her nails into claws, looking at each other they nodded again and
opened the door, ready to decimate anyone outside. What they saw when
they opened the door was a Hyuuga heir face first on the pavement
with blood streaming out her nose.</P><P>"Pervert." Kyuubi said while quickly returning her nails back to
normal.</P><P>Looking down at the girl Naruto shook his head.</P><P>"Hinata no way she's like the most chaste out of all of us."</P><P>"Then why does she have the patented nose drip?"</P><P>"Maybe she hit her nose?" Naruto suggested.</P><P>Kyuubi bent down to pick the girl up and sighed at Naruto's lack of
sense when it came to females.</P><P>"Don't you have somewhere you have to be?" Kyuubi asked him,
taking Hinata into the apartment.</P><P>"What and leave you here with her...alone!?"</P><P>Grabbing the girl and setting her on the couch Kyuubi straightened
and looked at Naruto.</P><P>"Do
you seriously mistrust me that much?" she asked, a little hurt.</P><P>"Have you given me any reason to trust you?" he countered</P><P>'The brat's got me there' she thought to herself.</P><P>Walking over to Naruto, Kyuubi stood right in front of him making eye
contact.</P><P>"I
Kyuubi no Kitsune greatest of all the bijuu, swear on my power that I
will not harm the Hyuuga girl in any physical way." A shimmer of
red light engulfed Kyuubi after she spoke the words before
disappearing.</P><P>Staring slack-jawed at Kyuubi, Naruto shook his head and quickly
found his voice again.</P><P>"What the hell did you just do?"</P><P>"I
made a promise, and now I have to abide by it or I lose by powers,
it's a demon law."</P><P>Tilting his head to the side that Kyuubi found cute, like a little
fox kit he asked. "You have laws?"</P><P>She
couldn't help herself, tilting her head back she laughed.</P><P>"Scary isn't to think that for all the destruction we do were
actually law abiding citizens...sort of." She managed to get out
before falling into a laughing fit again.</P><P>"Anyways does this at least install some trust in me, at the most
enough for you to trust me to be here alone?"</P><P>Not
wanting to admit it out loud that it had Naruto opted to just leave,
looking back just before jumping out of the window to give her the
whole 'I watching you' look.</P><P>After he left she burst out in laughter again only to stop when a
soft voice said "Naruto?"</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Jumping from rooftop to rooftop Naruto found himself thinking on what
Kyuubi had said, sure she pulled pranks almost as much as he used to
and while there was a bit of evil mischievous to them no one had ever
gotten hurt maybe a could trust her...a little.</P><P>The
trip to the Hokage tower passed quickly and almost before he knew it,
the wooden door that led to Tsunade's office loomed in front of him.
Taking a breath of air Naruto pushed it open.</P><P>"You wanted to see Obaa-chan?"</P><P>Without answering is initial question Tsunade tilted her head and
looked to her window where a red clad Sannin entered the room from.</P><P>"Ero-Sennin." Naruto said.</P><P>"Naruto..." The white haired man replied before stepping over to
stand next to Tsunade.</P><P>It
was then that Tsunade choose to speak. "Akatsuki."</P><P>Instantly Naruto stood alert...this was serious.</P><P>"The Akatsuki have decided to stop bothering to catch you."
Tsunade said.</P><P>A
smile started to break out on Naruto's face, that is until Tsunade's
adopted a more somber look.</P><P>"That's a good thing though right?" Naruto asked slowly looking
from Tsunade to Jiraiya.</P><P>"Three months..."</P><P>The
questioning look on Naruto's face spurred Tsunade on.</P><P>"Three months, in three months the Akatsuki, all of them are
coming. Capture is out of the question for them they are coming to
kill you to ensure that you can't interfere with their plans
anymore."</P><P>Naruto's open-mouthed expression mirrored back at him through both
Sannin's eyes.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Looking down to where the young heiress lay, Kyuubi took notice of
her gaze that was directed at the window Naruto had just left from.
Steadily that gaze moved form the window to meet her crimson eyes.</P><P>"Kitsune-chan."</P><P>Just by calling her name Kyuubi knew what the Hyuuga girl wanted to
say, what she wanted as a person, a woman and all the emotions that
were stirring in her small frame.</P><P>Sitting down in a chair opposite the white-eyed girl Kyuubi spoke.</P><P>"I
think it's time that me and you had a heart to heart."</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>"Just three months?" Naruto asked inside begging to Kami-sama
that this was some form of a joke...it was just that cruel.</P><P>Tsunade nodded her head.</P><P>"So
I'm going to die in three months?" As strong as he was he knew that
up against the whole of Akatsuki he'd be nothing more than a bump on
the road.</P><P>It
was then that Tsunade and Jiraiya looked at each other wicked smiles
crossing their lips.</P><P>"Actually Naruto..." Jiraiya began. "Your going to die in about
eighteen hours."</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Looking directly into Hinata's eyes Kyuubi spoke.</P><P>"Give up."</P><P>"Wh-what?" the confused heiress asked.</P><P>"Give up."</P><P>Looking anywhere but into the face of the young woman talking if
front of her Hinata pressed on.</P><P>"I...I don't know what your talk-"</P><P>"Naruto, give up on your crush. Trust me it's never gonna happen.
Not today, not tomorrow, not ever."</P><P>Without warning Hinata seemed to heat up, not in embarrassment but
anger. 'Who the hell does this girl think she is!' the young heiress
fumed inside.</P><P>Standing up Hinata looked down at Kyuubi anger fueling her
confidence.</P><P>"I
don't know who you think you are but-" She began before being cut
off again.</P><P>"That's right you don't know who I am and trust me that's for the
better. Further more don't ever try and look down at me....girl."
Kyuubi spoke standing up. The wave of killing intent she threw at the
Hyuuga girl silenced any forthcoming comments.</P><P>"That boy has had a hard life and it's only going to get harder, do
you think you could stand by his side through that, do you? He will
go through life having to earn every step towards happiness because
of who and what he is. Do you really think your little dis-illusions
will really ever happen? Besides that do really know who he is, where
he's come from and where he wants to go?"</P><P>Anger spurring her on again Hinata yelled back. "What about you
huh? You don't know anything about Naruto-kun, your...your just some
hussy who tricked him into sleeping with you! If it wasn't for you
being pregnant I bet he'd drop you off faster than I could say bitch!
Your acting like you've been with him your whole life you
haven't...you don't know anything about Naruto-kun. Yo-You probably
seduced him to that's the only way he'd sleep with you!"</P><P>For
the most part Kyuubi was surprised if her raised eyebrow was any
indication. 'Who would of thought that the young girl had it in her.
True if she knew who she was really talking to she'd probably wet
herself' Kyuubi thought, but the fact that she could stand up this
much to talk-back after the burst of killing intent spoke volumes of
how much she really cared for Naruto...or that she was just that
pissed.</P><P>Kyuubi smirked.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>"What the hell are you to talking about, and why are you smiling?"
Naruto yelled pointing his finger at the two Sannin. An action that
only provoked the Sannin to smile wider.</P><P>Getting up from her seat Tsunade strolled forward quickly and grabbed
Naruto's arm dragging him forward.</P><P>"Listen brat, you have one chance to pull this off don't screw it
up. Jiraiya and I have thought of a way to make sure one you aren't
killed, second to give you enough time hopefully get your ass in gear
and train to get stronger. Meanwhile we will be doing our best to try
and take out as many Akatsuki as we can to help you out. Now as for
the whole eighteen hours to live where gonna fake your death. It
might work to at least slow down Akatsuki a little and give you more
time understand?" Tsunade informed Naruto.</P><P>Naruto had one question. "How are you gonna do that?"</P><P>Sadly the answer he got was a blurry from crashing through the
windows while a huge banner unfurled with the caption "Save Gaki's
Ass Plan!!"</P><P>'Dear Kami not her. Naruto thought as the unmistakable form of
Mitarashi Anko stood up from her crash through the window. Looking up
she licked her lips.</P><P>"Gaki got sexy."</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Pushing the small coffee table aside Kyuubi walked up to Hinata.
Interestingly enough the heiress didn't back down.</P><P>"I
seduced him?"</P><P>"Th-that's what I said he'd never pick a girl like you, he...he'd
pick me." Despite standing firm Hinata's wavering voice gave Kyuubi
all she needed to know she had won, she was just playing with the
girl at now. 'It's gotta be a demon thing' Kyuubi mused. 'Play with
your food before you eat it'.</P><P>Leaning forward Kyuubi smirked. "Wanna know a secret?"</P><P>Without waiting for Hinata to answer Kyuubi continued.</P><P>"I'm not pregnant." she whispered to the Hyuuga girl.</P><P>Hinata's world went red. 'BITCH!!' Hinata thought.</P><P>The
only thing that stopped the ensuing 'cat fight' was the blonde haired
boy they were 'fighting' over entering and slamming the door behind
him startling both women.</P><P>"Naruto-kun!" Hinata said in surprise.</P><P>Kyuubi herself lifted an eyebrow in question at Naruto's disgruntled
appearance, and red face.</P><P>"What happened to you?"</P><P>Locking the door and walking past both girls to the bathroom Naruto
made the off hand comment. "Don't ask."</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>The
smile that adorned Anko's face made Naruto's skin crawl, and the way
her eyes where rolling up and down his frame like a piece of meat on
market seriously made him uncomfortable.</P><P>Tsunade took this time to address Naruto. "Anko-san here will be
the main player more or less in this attempt to fake your death. The
scenario is that you, Naruto will be facing against Anko in an
attempt to earn your Chuunin rank, the battle will be set at training
ground forty-four aka. Forest of Death. There you and Anko will
engage in a mock battle with a few witnesses, you are to take your
battle deeper into the forest and Jiraiya of myself will proceed on
the account that we will need to witness the fight. When that happen
we have something set up...in short you'll die there in a mock
battle. The hard part is smuggling you and your friend out of the
village, Anko also plays a crucial part in this as well. You, Anko,
and your 'friend' will sneak out of the village at night at that
point you will be traveling together to a designated location where
you three will be staying for the next three months. During that time
all three of you are to be training your asses off."</P><P>Turning to Anko Tsunade continued. "This will be set as a S-classed
mission and trust me your getting paid well for it. Shizune will
supply you will necessary information for the case of replenishing
provisions and such as well as a break-down for a training routine
when you meet up with her. Bear in mind that although this sounds
easy this is the most dangerous mission you will have done. Do you
still accept?"</P><P>Smirking Anko walked up to Naruto grabbed him by his cheeks and
pulled him into one hell of a passionate kiss. "Three months with
gaki here, hell I'd pose for the pervert over there for this chance."
Anko said pointing at Jiraiya.</P><P>"Really?" the said pervert asked walking forward hands
out-stretched in an obscene gesture, only to have his face plummeted
by Tsunade's fist sending him into the wall.</P><P>"Alright then Naruto be ready to die in seventeen hours." Tsunade
said glancing at a clock on the wall.</P><P>Naruto taking this at his chance to escape the clutches of the
special Jounin whom had yet to let go of him, broke free and darted
to the window on to get a face full of cleavage barely contained in a
fishnet shirt.</P><P>"Ohh, gaki wants to start early. Come on I know a good way to at
least pass fifteen of those seventeen hours." Anko said the ever
present smirk on her lips.</P><P>Tsunade decided to have mercy on him at this point and told Anko she
said to stay behind. Fuming Anko complied but not without giving
Naruto one last passionate kiss and a pinch on his behind.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Slamming the bathroom door Naruto proceeded to undress and take a
quick shower despite not having a bit of dust in him....he felt
dirty. After finishing that he stepped out and dressed, after word he
proceeded back into the living room where both girls still resided.</P><P>"Naruto-kun." Hinata immediately said upon his entrance.</P><P>Kyuubi picking this as the perfect time asked what happened at the
meeting, the blush that graced Naruto's face when she said that
however confused her.</P><P>Naruto not thinking straight spoke. "I'm going to die in about
seventeen hours."</P><P>"WHAT!" both females replied.</P><P>"Naruto-kun!" Hinata cried rushing over to embrace him. "I
don't want you to die!"</P><P>Having been yelled at by both females Naruto properly filled them in
on the details. When Kyuubi voiced her concern of Hinata hearing this
he replied he "trusted her.".</P><P>"Wait there is something you neglected to mention." Kyuubi
voiced.</P><P>When Naruto tilted his head in that oh so lovable way she choose to
be more specific.</P><P>"Who is going to coming with us and who do you have to fight?"</P><P>A
bright red blush seemingly exploded onto Naruto's face at the mention
of someone joining then. Whispering very softly the name of "Anko".
Both female's mouths dropped.</P><P>"Wait a minute Naruto-kun I appreciate the fact that you trust me
but why is this group Akatsuki after you?" Hinata asked.</P><P>Silence ensued.</P><P>"Ahh Hinata-chan I kinda killed two of their members while I was
out with Jiraiya training." Naruto said quickly trying to answer
the question truthfully but without giving anything away.</P><P>Inside Naruto was thinking as fast as he could. 'Please, please
believe me Hinata-chan''</P><P>Kyuubi sensing the problem acted fast, walking over to Naruto she
wrapped her arms around him in a possessive manner before standing up
on her toes and claiming his lips, effectively stopping Hinata's
train of thought.</P><P>"Well Naruto, sweetie I think it's time you and me pack up for this
trip." Kyuubi said after she released Naruto from the lip-lock.
Turning to Hinata Kyuubi began ushering her towards the door, Hinata
didn't put up much resistance as she was in a near comatose state
form seeing Naruto engaged in such and activity. When the door closed
behind her Hinata walked home on auto-pilot her thoughts of a certain
blonde kissing a white-eyed beauty.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>When the door closed and Kyuubi looked back Naruto was standing there
slack-jawed.</P><P>"What the hell was that!"</P><P>"You had to get rid of her that provided the perfect cover and
distraction, don't get used to though." Kyuubi replied back.</P><P>Naruto stood there stunned.</P><P>"Well are you going to get ready or not?" Kyuubi asked.</P><P>Numbly Naruto set off to grab the things he would need.</P><P>Watching him go to his room Kyuubi snickered. "I still got it."</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Tsunade sighed as she looked out the windows of her office, offering
her the panoramic view of the village. Everything had been set up,
the guests all rounded up everything was fine, but that didn't help
the uneasy feeling in Tsunade's stomach. This planned needed to go
off flawlessly and although Jiraiya vouched for Naruto's ability she
still had her doubts and they plagued her to no end.</P><P>"Relax, everything is going to be fine. That boy has grown up in
more ways than just his appearance." Jiraiya said stepping into
office.</P><P>"I
hope your right."</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>The
sun arched through the sky and faster than Naruto anticipated the
appointed time came, with Kyuubi at his heels he stepped out into the
night letting the cool breeze sweep back his blonde locks and caress
his face.</P><P>"You ready?" Kyuubi asked showing some concern for her container.</P><P>"Yeah and besides I know I'll come back." With that thought in
mind they proceeded to the Forest of Death.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>"Hokage-sama." Hizashi Hyuuga spoke. "Is it really necessary
for such an examination to be in the middle of the night.</P><P>Turning to the man Tsunade simply replied "Yes."</P><P>Within ten minutes everyone turned up. Naruto, Kyuubi, Anko the key
members. Jiraiya, Kakashi, Yugao Uzuki, Tsume Inuzuka and oddly
enough Ayame Ichiraku among the spectators along with Hizashi and
Tsunade herself.</P><P>Speaking in her most authoritative voice Tsunade addressed the people
before her.</P><P>"You have all been gathered her for the purpose of witnessing
Naruto Uzumaki attempt to make the rank of Chuunin. The law states
that at least two members of the council must be present along with
two members of the ninja community and a member of the civilian
population as well as the Hokage. With that in mind the rules are the
same as those of the Chuunin Exams Naruto Uzumaki will engage in
battle with Anko Mitarashi for the title. If there are no further
questions let it began."</P><P>Tsunade's hope for a quick start off went wary when Tsume asked about
Kyuubi's presence. Thinking quickly Tsunade replied.</P><P>"She is Monogatari Kitsune and Naruto Uzumaki's fiance. She is also
expecting his child that gives her reason enough to be here besides I
asked her to come." Tsunade said quickly.</P><P>It
stopped any further questioning about the girl's presence but many
eyebrows were raised when she said that. Kakashi actually had the
gull to walk up to his former student and pat him on the back.<BR>"Your a man now Naruto, I proud of you!" While looking at
Kyuubi and giving a thumbs up in a very Gai-like fashion.</P><P>Coughing Tsunade managed to regain order and then told Naruto and
Anko to begin the match.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Stepping into the forest a 'safe' distance away from the rest of the
group but still within eyesight Naruto and Anko squared off.</P><P>"Naruto-chan." Anko cooed "I hope your ready.</P><P>"BEGIN!" Tsunade yelled.</P><P>Immediately Naruto and Anko jumped back ten feet. Anko pulling out
three kunai in each hand launched them at Naruto. This might be a
mock battle but that didn't mean Anko was going to go easy on the
brat. Seeing the kunai coming Naruto bent back to almost a ninety
degree angle using Chakra to keep his feet on the ground steading
him. When the kunai passed he shot back up just in time to catch a
roundhouse to the face from Anko sending him into a nearby tree.</P><P>"Come on Naruto-Chan you can do better than that I know you can."
Anko cried out.</P><P>"Katon: Goukakyuu no Jutsu!" A thick gout of flame shot out of
the dust and debris of the tree hurtling straight for Anko. Smirking
Anko leap out of the way and the flame past harmlessly by. Looking
back though Naruto was no where to be found. 'Where are you gaki?'</P><P>"Kage Bunshin no Jutsu." Naruto could be heard yelling
accompanied by the tale-tell smoke that came with the jutsu. Out of
the trees twenty Naruto's landed in front of Anko.</P><P>"You have to do better than this." Anko said running into the
pack dispatching clones left and right until only two remained.
Grabbing a Kunai out of her pouch she flung it at one of them.</P><P>"Senai Jashuu"Anko yelled as a viper came out of her sleeve and
bit the other Naruto on the arm. Both of which poofed into oblivion.</P><P>"If
that's it I'm disappointed Naruto-chan." Anko pouted.</P><P>"Don't worry Anko-san I'm just getting started." Naruto said
walking out into Anko's eyesight.</P><P>"Well see gaki."</P><P>Slipping into stance Anko waited for Naruto to make the first strike
when he just stood there smirking, it began to piss her off.</P><P>"Are you gonna attack or what!"</P><P>"No."</P><P>"Then how the hell do you plan to win if you don't attack."</P><P>"I
said I won't attack... not he won't." Naruto said a smirk on his
lips.</P><P>Sensing an attack Anko spun around just in time to dodge the two
curved swords that would have bisected her a moment later. In front
of her stood another Naruto the same smirk on his lips.</P><P>Grabbing two kunai form her pouch Anko whispered "Ken-jutsu."</P><P>Watching the clone carefully for any movement Anko spared a quick
look to see the other Naruto standing in the same spot as before.</P><P>Turning back to face the clone she laughed. 'ok gaki lets play.'</P><P>Rushing forward Anko brought her right hand down at an attempt to
stab his neck, this was parried by one of his swords as he shoved his
other sword forward aiming at her stomach, that to was parried by
Anko's other kunai. Naruto pushing forward suddenly threw Anko off
balance as Naruto retracted his blades and spun in a circle his
swords leveled at two different heights. If the swords hit, Anko
would be in three pieces, reacting on instinct Anko jumped into the
air spinning horizontally letting the swords pass beneath and above
her spinning body. Countering Naruto by delivering a kick to his face
sending him some feet away, waiting for the 'poof' signaling the
clones dismissal, it was then that Naruto's grinning but bruised face
met her gaze. That surprised her and that was what Naruto's clone was
waiting for.</P><P>"Kaze no Yaiba" Anko heard the now known clone behind her yell,
whilst extending his arms. The air seemed to scream as blades of wind
blasted forth.</P><P>"Shit."</P><P>Doing the only thing she could Anko slammed her hands on the ground.</P><P>"Doton: Doryuuheki." Mud seemed to gush out Anko's mouth and
quickly formed a wall of earth that bore the brunt of the attack none
the less it only stood up to the winds once, falling over immediately
after word. The clone that lunched the attack poofed into smoke it's
chakra spent.</P><P>Naruto took this opportunity while Anko made her wall of earth.
Running up to engage her. Anko managing to turn around in time saw
him coming. Flashes of silver were countered by grey blurs and the
sound of sharpened metal clashing rang out so fast it sounded like a
continuous wail.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>For
her part Tsunade was impressed he was holding his own, albeit Anko
wasn't going all out but even so this was an accomplishment all on
it's own.</P><P>"He
seems to holding out nicely, but I think he's holding back."
Hizashi voiced.</P><P>Nodding her head Tsume agreed. "He isn't even sweating yet. But he
still hasn't managed to get a hit on her."</P><P>"Just wait."</P><P>Turning to face the man who said it they quickly looked back towards
the fight.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Naruto had the upper-hand, with his swords being longer he was
expending less energy than she was and that was a bad thing, she
needed to get rid of those swords. Thinking quickly Anko countered
his thrust with the right sword with her left hand while turning and
pushing his left away with her right leaving her back to his front.
Throwing her head back it collided with Naruto's nose and a sickening
crush echoed throughout the forested area.</P><P>This left Naruto in a daze that Anko capitalized on. Flipping her
kunai over Anko hooked them into the hilts of his swords and pulled
them from his grasp, Turning around she sent a kick aimed at his
head. Even in the case of momentary blurred vision Naruto ducked
under the kick countering with a leg sweep that caught Anko off guard
and sent her to the ground. Leaping back Naruto put much needed
distance between them, while Anko was getting up Naruto reached into
one of the many pouches that lined his as many belts and grabbed a
scroll. Unfurling it quickly Naruto threw it on tree pinning it there
with several kunai, Anko managed to see the kanji for kaze along with
other seal markings before Naruto drew another kunai and threw it
into the center of the seal unleashing what seemed like hurricane
force winds at Anko lifting her off her feet and slamming her into
the trunk of a tree the kunai that unleashed the wind slamming hilt
deep into the tree next to her head. 'Shit!'</P><P>Acting quickly Naruto went through a set of hand signs. "Katon: 
Karyuu Endan." Intense flames spilled from Naruto's mouth as he
directed it into the wind released from his scroll.</P><P>The
powerful flame jutsu seemed to snuff itself out before exploding into
a rush of fire three times the size of before following the rush of
air that the scroll provided sending on a one way trip straight at
Anko.</P><P>"Fuck me."</P><P>Thankfully when she slammed into the tree she bit her lip reacting as
fast as she could Anko wiped her lip and went through a set of hand
signs. "Kyuichose no Jutsu." A rush of smoke flew into the air
and the immediate scream of some creature could be heard as the
flames from Naruto's attack seared it to charcoal.</P><P>The
scroll spent, The area reeking of ozone and charred flesh plagued the
air like a disease. Looking over to where Anko was the sickly black,
and burnt carcase of a large serpentine creature could be seen with
Anko leaning at the base of the tree behind it. The skin on her
stomach, legs and cheeks was bright red from the slight burn she had,
looking like she had a case of sunburn.</P><P>Standing up Anko threw a dirty look Naruto's way.</P><P>"That could've killed me Naruto-chan..."</P><P>Shrugging his shoulders Naruto replied "Paybacks a bitch."</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Tsunade couldn't believe it...this was suppose to be a mock battle
and it seemed like they forgot all about that fact. They were ether
acting their hearts out or they were really trying to kill one
another. Looking over to Jiraiya she sent a patented look that
clearly exclaimed 'What the hell?'</P><P>Shrugging he turned back to the spectacle in front of him. Covertly
though he reached into on of the hidden pouches he kept on his person
and grabbed a certain kunai focusing his chakra for a moment he
replaced it back in the pouch.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Bending down and picking up his fallen swords Naruto's eyes widen
when the hilt of one had a hot touch to it. Looking in the direction
of Jiraiya he understood the cryptic message. Looking back at Anko
who noticed the change in persona he leapt off further in the Forest
of Death Anko close on his heels.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>When Tsunade saw Naruto and Anko take off she breathed a sigh of
relief, they were sticking to the plan.</P><P>"Jiraiya follow them." she ordered which he proceeded to do
posthaste.</P><P>"Hokage-sama I thought this match was for us to watch." Hizashi
inquired.</P><P>"It
is Jiraiya is going to tell them to bring it back here."</P><P>Tsume took this moment to let out a bark-like laugh. "You gotta
hand it to the kid he's got balls trying something like that to Anko,
he'll be lucky enough to escape her ire soon enough." all around
heads nodded to her statement.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Jiraiya caught up to the two way-word ninja in no time at all,
considering they were both sitting on a few branches waiting for him.
Naruto sat rubbing the back of his neck trying to get the imaginary
kink out before gabbing some cloth and wiping away the blood that
stained his lower face from the broken nose while Anko was applying
what appeared to be some form of burn ointment on her stomach and
legs.</P><P>"I
could help you with that." The white-haired Sannin said
lecherously, only to have a kunai impact the tree behind him right
below a certain special place.</P><P>Deciding that was warning enough he became serious after all he
rather liked that special place.</P><P>"Follow me." gesturing to his left the group took off.</P><P>Sprinting through the trees Naruto voiced a question that had been
bothering him.</P><P>"Ne
Ero-Sennin, what are we gonna do about the bodies? There will have to
be some won't there?"</P><P>Patting one of his pouches was his way of saying he had it covered.
It wasn't until Anko muttered "cadavers" that Naruto knew what he
was referencing.</P><P>"Tsunade took the liberty of 'losing' two bodies, both already dead
and after some preparation they are fit enough to be a guise. Besides
I doubt there will be much left anyway."</P><P>"How exactly to do you plan to kill us?"</P><P>"During the Last Great Shinobi War the entire area around Konoha
had seals in place in for traps your just going to manage and trigger
one of the ones that wasn't disposed of." Jiraiya told them.</P><P>"Isn't that a little convenient?" Anko asked.</P><P>"Hey you gotta a better plan I'm all ears...until then this is it."</P><P>Reaching a clearing the Toad Sannin jumped down to the forest floor
and proceeded to take a scroll out that he set on the ground and
pumped a bit of chakra into. Two bodies 'poofed' into existence one
male and the other female wearing identical clothing to their
counterparts. Stepping away from the bodies for the moment he turned
to address the other two.</P><P>"After this goes off head that way. Keep going until you get to an
old look-out post. Stay there until Shizune meets up with you two,
she'll be there with your 'friend' Naruto. Shizune will give you a
map to your destination at that point head out and what ever you do
don't be seen. Now get going." Pointing in the direction of where
they needed to go Jiraiya turned back to the bodies.</P><P>"Ero-Sennin..." Naruto began.</P><P>Turning around the Sannin smiled at his young charge, although it was
tinted with sadness. "Will meet each other again Naruto, just grow
strong and come back as soon as you can."</P><P>His
expression quickly changed to a lecherous grin. "Besides when you
do tell me about all the naughty stuff you and the two girls did
while you were away." he laughed....a kunai grazed his cheek in
answer.</P><P>Meeting his teachers gaze one last time Naruto headed to the
look-out, Anko at his heels.</P><P>When those two were far enough the Toad Sannin grabbed the scroll and
deposited it back into it's pouch. Biting a thumb he wiped the blood
onto the ground where a large seal diagram formed reaching out at
least twenty feet in diameter, the bodies lying in the center.
Standing he made is way some feet out from the seal...far enough not
to be killed but close enough to get hit.</P><P>'The stuff I do for that brat' he smiled before setting the seal of
with a chakra infused kunai.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>Standing exactly were they were before waiting for the Sannin and two
combatants they waited. When the head of Hyuuga, Hizashi asked if he
should look for them with his Byakugan Tsunade told him it was not
necessary.</P><P>"What do you think so far?" Tsunade asked the few ninja there.</P><P>"Naruto's grown a lot." Kakashi voiced the sentiment many shared.</P><P>With the some-what quiet forest all around them the last thing anyone
expected was the huge explosion that shook the ground sending Ayame
on her backside.</P><P>Acting her part Tsunade looked at the others, surprise crossing her
features, a look many of them shared before heading to find the
source her fellow ninja close at hand and one civilian carried along.
Moving as fast as they could the air soon became stagnant with smoke
and the smell of burnt forestry. It wasn't long at all until they
came across an area that had been blasted to high hell, off to the
side Jiraiya lay slightly singed and bloody rushing over Tsunade bent
down and helped him what.</P><P>"What happened where is Naruto and Anko?" Tsunade asked quickly.</P><P>Pointing over to where two charred and barely intact bodies remained
Jiraiya chocked out.</P><P>"They're dead..." his voice thick with emotion.</P><P><B>A.N.-
</B>OMG an update...I really don't
have too much of an excuse for it being this late and I am really
really sorry. Besides that WOW this is the longest update ever, see I
told you I'd do a longer one next time. Other than that the story
will be picking up more on a Naruto and Kyuubi level than what it had
before and Anko being there is just to help make it awkward which she
can do easily. As for you reviews and comments I love hearing from
you and I am very glad that you enjoy this story... <B>THANK
YOU </B>and I hope you the readers
will continue to enjoy me work. If you have any comments or questions
please by all means send it in a review or personal message and I
will get back to you as fast possible.</P><P>Zanaso Clramm</P><P>Now
for you enjoyment an <B><I><U>OMAKE </U></I></B></P><P>Naruto had the upper-hand, with his swords being longer he was
expending less energy than she was and that was a bad thing, she
needed to get rid of those swords. Thinking quickly Anko countered
his thrust with the right sword with her left hand while turning and
pushing his left away with her right leaving her back to his front.
Throwing her head back it collided with Naruto's nose and a sickening
crush echoed throughout the forested area.</P><P>This
left Naruto in a daze that Anko capitalized on. Flipping her kunai
over Anko hooked them into the hilts of his swords and pulled them
from his grasp, Turning around she sent a kick aimed at his head.
Even in the case of momentary blurred vision Naruto ducked under the
kick with her leg still extended Naruto reacted on instinct yelling
out "Sennen
Goroshi"
thrusting his fingers forward.</P><P>Along the
sidelines Kakashi and Jiraiya's noses exploded into a fountain of
blood throwing them back, Ayame passed out along with Yugao. Tsunade
stared open-mouthed at the display before she to took a one way trip
to the realm of unconsciousness blood dripping from her nose.
Hizashi's eyebrow looked like it was having a seizure due to the
frantic twitching it had adopted before he turned around and headed
back to the village as fast as he could. Kyuubi for her part was
still conscious but had one hell of a blush across of her cheeks and
was actually fidgeting.</P><P>Naruto when he
realized what he had done faired no better than Kyuubi looking like a
tomato ripe for picking this sentiment only further when Anko cooed.</P><P>"Naruto-chan
I didn't know you cared so much...let me help you out."</P><P>...That was how
Mitarashi Anko became Uzumaki Anko...</P><P><B>Naruto is

<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P>As Naruto and Anko
made their way towards the old look-out post that Jiraiya had pointed
them the direction to, a calm silence settled between the two, at
least until the huge blast unleashed by the Toad Sannin reached them,
upsetting their balance a little before they regained their footing.</P><P>"What the hell,
he's really not playing around is he." Naruto said aloud, Anko
beside him nodding in agreement. It took them another thirty or so
minutes to come across a dilapidated structure, where they saw
Shizune and Kyuubi waiting for them.</P><P>"Took you long
enough." Kyuubi said, the ever present smirk lingering on her lips.</P><P>Stopping to think
a moment Naruto looked at Kyuubi, then back at the way they came from
before repeating this a few times.</P><P>"What the hell
how did you beat us here?!" Naruto shouted pointing his finger at
Kyuubi, or he would have if not for Anko placing her hand over his
mouth and hitting him in the back of the head shutting him up.</P><P>"Keep quiet,
where a ways from Konoha but there might be patrols running around,
and Hokage-sama needed this to be done in complete secrecy." Anko
admonished.</P><P>"Well yeah but
come on, you're not the least bit curious as to how they beat us
here?"</P><P>Deciding to take
pity on the poor teen, Kyuubi spoke up. "It was a shadow clone back
there, you use it enough I would've thought that you noticed that
right away."</P><P>Standing over to
the side Shizune watched as the trio continued to bicker back and
forth until she cleared her throat gaining their attention.</P><P>"As I'm sure
Tsunade-sama already stated I'm here to give you the directions to
where you three will be hiding out for the three months." Shizune
said handing over a map to Anko who nodded and looked at it quickly
before putting it in her trench coat.</P><P>Continuing her
explanation Shizune said. "As for food and the like the place is
well stocked from what I've heard from Jiraiya-sama. Naruto you
will need to wipe a bit of your blood on the insignia you will notice
on the gates, this will let you in and anyone with your permission."
Shizune finished.</P><P>Nodding in
understanding Naruto asked if there was anything else he needed to
know, shaking her head no, Shizune stepped forward gathering Naruto
in her arms in an embrace that Naruto mirrored both in action and
feelings.</P><P>With slightly
misty eyes Shizune bid the group good-bye before leaping into the
tree back towards Konoha.</P><P>Grabbing the map
back out of her trench coat Anko looked over at the other two, before
examining where the map highlighted where the hide-out was.</P><P>"Alight gaki's
it's about a week's travel from here let's get moving." She
said before back at the two "teens" under her charge.</P><P>Glancing at each
other Naruto and Kyuubi nodded before all three headed out.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>"What do you
mean their dead?!" Tsunade screamed, acting her part perfectly
running over to where "Naruto's" corpse lay she dropped to her
knees looking at the charred corpse of her precious little brother.
The acting was easier than she thought it be, mostly due to the fact
that if they didn't play their cards right, this may very well be
what Naruto ended up looking like in the coming months.</P><P>Getting up from
his position on the ground Jiraiya made his way over to Tsunade
bending down beside her, hugging her tightly.</P><P>"I'm so sorry
Tsunade; there was nothing I could do." Jiraiya said tears
streaking down his face. Behind them Kakashi stood in frozen shock,
this couldn't be real, it had to be some sick joke that the blonde
haired vessel had to be playing on them all. He wouldn't accept it;
he couldn't accept that his dear sensei's son met such an
unexpected end.</P><P>Standing not far
from Kakashi, Yugao Uzuki and Tsume Inuzuka were in as much shock as
Naruto's former Sensei. Tears were already forming in Yugao's
eyes, she had been one of the ANBU stationed to watch the teen when
he was younger, and he had grown on her as much as a nephew could
even if he never really met her face to face. After the death of her
lover she'd taken the people she knew a little closer to her heart,
Naruto being one of those few. For Tsume it was almost losing a son,
Naruto had been invited over to the clan complex a number of times
along with Shikamaru and Chouji. The four of them were as close as
cousin's if not brother's and the up-beat way Naruto went through
life won over the hearts of many Inuzuka, even at expense of falling
into one or two of his pranks.</P><P>Ayame openly wept,
Naruto was her little brother in all but blood, it wasn't fair he
just came back, he was going to be a father…he was in the highlight
of his life. At these thoughts Ayame remembered the red-haired girl
that was Naruto's "fiancé", turning to find the girl she saw
Kyuubi running from the scene hands holding her face and cries of
despair clearly were heard. From his place next to Tsunade saw this,
cursing under his breath he sped off obviously to comfort the woman.</P><P>Hisashi stood off
to the side where he silently paid his respects to both, he had
nothing against Naruto but the grief this would cause his daughter
weighed heavily on his heart.</P><p align='center'>&</P><P>With Anko in the
lead the trio made their way to a roadside-inn where they agreed to
spend the night, it was the last spot they were going to be able to
enjoy a comfortable bed before they made it to their destination.</P><P>All three were in
henge, Anko took the form of a middle-aged man with Naruto and Kyuubi
disguised as his children.</P><P>The Inn itself was
a quaint two-story wooden building with a small sign hanging above
the door, upon entering a steady wave of heat from the fireplace
washed over their bodies warming their cool skin.</P><P>"Ne Tou-san are
we staying here the night." Kyuubi spoke in the form of a little
girl clinging on to an equally little boy that was Naruto.</P><P>"Of course
sweetie, after all we've come quite a ways." Anko spoke.</P><P>Making their way
to the front desk a gray-haired woman stood smiling warmly at the
scene.</P><P>"Excuse me, may
I get a single room with two beds please." Anko asked in guise.</P><P>"Of course would
you be interested in the morning breakfast as well?" she asked
watching the little girl hang onto to her brother's arm in a cute
fashion.</P><P>Anko was about to
say that was unnecessary but Naruto cut her off.</P><P>"Breakfast all
right; I've been dying for some good food!" Naruto nearly yelled.</P><P>Forcing a strained
smile Anko accepted and the woman behind the desk directed the group
to their room, after asking if they needed anything else she made her
way back down to her station.</P><P>Dropping the henge
almost immediately Kyuubi made her way to one of the beds where she
flung herself one un-gracefully.</P><P>"Should you be
doing that?" Anko asked dropping her henge as well.</P><P>"Do what?"</P><P>"You're
pregnant right, I'm no doctor but should you really be doing that?"</P><P>Kyuubi couldn't
help herself laughter spilled from her mouth like water from a
faucet, raising a delicate hand in an attempt to still her mirth
Kyuubi looked up at Anko.</P><P>"You really
thought I was pregnant, with his child." Kyuubi said turning her
head in Naruto's direction.</P><P>"Hey what's
wrong with that?" Naruto spoke up, not really understanding but
somehow feeling that she was insulting him.</P><P>Ignoring the boy
completely Anko leveled her gaze at the young woman before her.</P><P>"Is there
anything else I should know before we continue on?" she asked in a
tone that clearly meant "You better tell me everything."</P><P>Smirking evilly
Kyuubi just laughed.</P><P>"You have no
ideal."</P><P>A.N.- A long time in
coming and yes I know the chapter is short, but it's for a reason
the next will be longer. First I'd like to THANK ALL OF YOU for
your reviews they really make me want continue to write this story so
a BIG THANKS.</P><P>Next I'm sorry
but this will be a NarutoXKyuubi story there will be no other pairing
with Naruto, sorry if this upsets you but there are just so many
'fics' with Kyuubi in a harem and I wanted to do one with just
those two, now that's not to say Anko won't be trying anything
because let's face it, she'd most likely do it just to stir up
those two, the final pairing will just be Naruto and Kyuubi.</P><P>I hope you
continue to enjoy my story and ask you to check out my other stories
if you haven't already.</P><P>Please let me know
what you think of the story so far okay.</P><P>Zanaso Clramm</P>
