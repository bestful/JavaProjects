<p> 

</p>
<p>Naruto
collapsed next to the running water, panting heavily. With tears streaming down
his cheeks, he glanced at the water.</p>
<p>I could drown,
he thought desperately. Anything… <i>anything</i> to get me away from those
memories… anything to get rid of <i>them</i>…

</p>
<p>With
a shuddering groan, Naruto was lost to the peaceful blackness of
unconsciousness.

</p>
<p> 

</p>
<p> 

</p>

</p>
<p> 

</p>
<p>Nine:
*attacks Angel* How could you do that to my kit?! My precious kit?!

</p>
<p>Angel:
*is in pain* Help me!

</p>
<p>Kakashi:
… Nah.

</p>
<p>Naruto:
Yeah – this is much more entertaining!

</p>
<p>Angel:
I hate you both! *uses magical author powers to take away Nine's
demon powers and trap her in a box*

</p>
<p>Nine:
*sounding pretty rabid* KILL!!

</p>
<p>Angel:
*whimpers* Uh… Let's just leave her in there, shall we? ^^;;

</p>
<p>Naruto:
*creeps over to box and starts whispering to Nine on how she can get out*

</p>
<p>Kakashi:
*reading Icha Icha Paradise; distractedly* Yeah, yeah, whatever…

</p>
<p>Angel:
-_-;;;; I'm so loved… Anyway, I don't own Naruto. Till next time!

</p>
<p>(Oh,
and PS -- *glomps Kakashi* Thou shalt never have my Kakashi-koi, neesan! Nevah!
*laughs manically*)

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br>





<p>"Naruto?"</p>
<p>A pile of
orange sheets groaned and shifted slightly.</p>
<p>"Naru-kit?"</p>
<p>A hand snaked
out of the sheets to grab at the edge of a comforter that had fallen off the bed
and attempted to drag it back on, grumbling something unintelligible.</p>
<p>"Thank you
for telling me where you are."</p>
<p>Keditsumonne
grabbed a handful of sheets and punched, causing Naruto to sit up and yelp.
Holding his left shoulder, he glared at the human-disguised Demon Fox, who sat
grinning at him.</p>
<p>"What was
that for?"</p>
<p>"To wake you
up," she replied cheerily.</p>
<p>He looked out
his window and turned back to her, angry, confused and still half-asleep.</p>
<p>"The sun
isn't even up. Why on earth did you force me awake at this ungodly hour?"</p>
<p>She grinned at
him. "Because I signed you up for high school." Frowning she punched him
again when he groaned and attempted to bury himself in the sheets again.
"C'mon, you, <i>I've</i> been up for two hours already."</p>
<p>"Wonders of
coffee?" Naruto guessed, dragging himself out of bed and over to his dresser.</p>
<p>"Worse."
She leaned in a grinned. "Wonders of <i>sugar</i>."</p>
<p>Naruto, in the
midst of pulling out his usual black shirt, jerked. "Oh sweet merciful gods
above, no."</p>
<p>Kedit giggled
and twitched. "No one can save you now, kit. Especially if I 'cave in' and
let you stay home today."</p>
<p>Naruto quickly
picked up his shirt and shooed Kedit out of his room. "Now, now. Why ever
would I want to stay here when I can just as easily go to the Hell of earth
known as high school at such a beautiful, ungodly hour such as this?"</p>
<p>Kedit grinned
as Naruto slammed the door behind her. "I'm making breakfast, so hurry up
with your shower, 'kay?" she called through the door.</p>
<p>"All
right."</p>
<p>As Kedit
descended the stairs, Naruto could have sworn he heard her mumble to herself,
"Sugar – the best excuse possible."</p>
<p>Shaking his
head in disbelief at the deranged demon, he shifted around in his dresser for
his usual orange pants. After fishing out a pair of blue socks and throwing them
on the bed, he grabbed his shirt and pants and walked across the hall and into
the bathroom. Placing his clothing on the counter he turned the water on and
waited for it to warm up. Casting a quick glance in the mirror, he grimaced when
he noticed the only scar he'd ever obtained across his chest.</p>
<p><i>~*~flash~*~
he stomach pain shooting through his abdomen kedit screaminga blade a blade on
his chest kedit couldnt help pain cant breathe need air ~*~flash~*~

</i></p>
<p>Naruto physically jerked
himself away from the mirror, leaning on the door and gasping in the steam from
the shower. Shoving away the memory (and the shaking it brought with it), he
took off his boxers and stepped into the steady stream of water.</p>
<p>With the steamy water pounding on his tensed
muscles and the thick air filling his nose and mouth each time he inhaled, he
felt himself relax. With slow, thought-refusing movements, he focused on
cleaning himself and not remembering.</p>
<p>Washing away
the last of the soap, he sighed softly and relaxed against the shower wall.
Suddenly, even over the rush of water, he could hear the flush of a toilet.</p>
<p>That meant only
one thing.</p>
<p>Naruto yelped
and leapt out of the shower as the warm water suddenly turned freezing.
Growling, he snatched a towel and wrapped it about his waist. Opening the door a
crack (and ignoring the laughter that sounded throughout the rest of the house)
he yelled, "Very funny, Kedit! You could've just knocked on the door!"</p>
<p>"But where
would the fun be in <i>that</i>?!" Kedit called back, still laughing.</p>
<p>Closing the
door again with a roll of his eyes, Naruto turned off the water, grabbed his
clothes and vanished into his room.</p>
<p>Reemerging,
clad in blue tennis shoes and socks, orange pants and black shirt and pulling on
an orange jacket, he bounded down the stairs and bounced into the kitchen where
Kedit was just putting pancakes and syrup on the table. Looking up and seeing
him reach into his pocket to fish out a leaf hitai-ate from one of the jacket
pockets and tie it around his head, she smiled and turned to pour two glasses of
milk.</p>
<p>"I can't
believe that, even after all these years, you still wear that stuff. Frankly,
I'm surprised it still fits nicely." Smiling in response to his grin, she
turned to the table, glasses in her hands and milk back in the fridge.
"There's still half an hour before we have to leave."</p>
<p>Naruto, too
hungry to bother comprehending more than her pleasant tone, grunted something
that sounded like an agreement and grabbed a stack of five pancakes. Reaching
for the syrup and butter, he said impishly, "When I get home I expect there to
be ramen in the pantry."</p>
<p>Sitting across
from him, Kedit handed him a glass of milk and made a face. "For the love of
the gods, Naru, you'd think after nearly a millennia, you'd get sick and
tired of that stuff!"</p>
<p>"Hey," he
said defensively, slathering butter on his food before drowning it in syrup.
"You can never get 'sick and tired' of <i>ramen</i>!"</p>
<p>"Well, for
your information," Kedit said, snatching the butter and syrup for her own
four-pancake stack, "<i>I</i> am sick and tired of ramen and will continue to
be for about a <i>month</i>! I thank the gods above and below every time I <i>don't</i>
see that stuff in my pantry!"</p>
<p>He mad a face
at her (made all the more disgusting by the fact that he "forgot" there was
food in his mouth). She made her own face back at him (which was much more
pleasant by her not having started eating) and quickly went to ravage her
pancakes, halting all conversation for the time being.</p>
<p>Washing down
the last of her sugar-loaded breakfast with the last gulps of milk, she glanced
at the clock and stood, grabbing her dishes.</p>
<p>"Kit, help me
clear the table and I'll take you to school."</p>
<p>Naruto made a
face, but drabbed his own dishes and carted them off to the sink.</p>
<p>

<p>Chapter one
done.</p>
<p>Nine: *having
managed to escape the box* I shall be the reason of your untimely death for what
you have done to my kit…</p>
<p>Angel: You'll
be that anyway, no matter what I do!</p>
<p>Nine:
*contemplates this* … True.</p>
<p>Angel: *looks
at other muses* And none of you plan to stop this?</p>
<p>Naruto: You
kidding? I'm cheering her on! Go, mom! Kill her! Free us all!</p>
<p>Kakashi: *still
reading Icha Icha Paradise; mumbles something unintelligible*</p>
<p>Angel: -_-;;;
Kakashi, do you even know why you're here?</p>
<p>Kakashi: For
you to cuddle.</p>
<p>Angel: Exactly!
^^ *glomps him*</p>
<p>Naruto: What
did that have to do with anything?</p>
<p>Angel: Nothing
really – I just wanted to glomp him. ^^</p>
<p>Naruto: Of
course. Why else?</p>
<p>Angel: ^^ Well,
I don't own Naruto, so, till next time!</p>
