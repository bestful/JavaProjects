He was dressed in a regular grey shirt and brown pants that sagged all the way down to his wet sandals. A long black coat covered his body, protecting him from the unforgivable winds and the sub-zero droplets of the rain.</p><p>The wind blew harshly, frustrating the young teen as her bright red hair was whipped around by the icy winds, forcing her( much to her displeasure) to tie up her hair into a ponytail.</p><p>God, she looked ugly in a ponytail.</p><p>Making their way through the unusually cold weather, they marched up to small booth by the gates, desiring to get out of the weather immediately.</p><p>The two guards sat up, giving them a look of suspicion as they handed their ID over.</p><p>"So...Mr. Uragiri, you're here with for a residency of this village, am I correct?" The guard asked, peering down on the ID.</p><p>The man, identified as Uragiri nodded, giving a small, friendly smile.</p><p>"And you're traveling companion, Amaru. No last name recorded, is she your child?"</p><p>Uragiri shook his head as the young teen known as Amaru fiddled with her gear, droplets of rain sliding down to her white wet blouse, forcing the blouse to hug her figure, unaware of the transparency of her clothes that detailed her black bra. The man gave her sly smirk, his eye's trailing up and down her figure as he licked his lips, lust embedded within his dark black eyes.</p><p>"No, she is not my child. She's a 'companion' of mine, we've travelled together since I passed by Wave Country" Uragiri replied, eye's never leaving Amaru.</p><p>The guards nodded before handing the ID's back to them, their eye's glancing at the wet road expectantly. Uragiri walked off, heading down Main Street as he left Amaru by the front gates. Amaru's curiosity increased as they stared expectantly at the wet, muddy road, eye's never waving away from their target.</p><p>"What are you waiting for?" Amaru spoke up, watching the guards' stare at the road.</p><p>The guards looked away from the road, glancing back at her eye's as they gave her a sorrowful look.</p><p>"Hopefully, not a corpse" He replied.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The tree's rustled endlessly, leaves blowing away to the dark forest as the rain hailed down upon them, striking every inch of the forest as a heavily bruised boy lay unconscious on the grass, his clothes ripped and body covered head to toe in fresh wounds. Another boy sat next to him, leaning on the tree for support as blood leaked profusely from the gaping hole that was once his chest. His bright orange clothes stained blood red as he let out ragged breathing, clutching his wound. His spiky blonde hair draped over his forehead, wet and messy, as he pulled out two blue headbands from his small pocket. He glanced down at them, his eyes tracing over the insignia embedded within the steel plaque sewn into the blue cloth.</p><p>'<i>Sakura-Chan' </i></p><p>He made a promise, a promise of a lifetime; to bring back Uchiha Sasuke from the clutches of the sadistic, power hungry serpent: Orochimaru. He never broken a promise nor does he intends to start. He'll risk his life and limb, soul and heart, to keep this promise to the one he cherishes, the one he loves.</p><p>'<i>This is a promise of a lifetime'</i></p><p>His eyes snapped open, showing off his luminance, cerulean blue eyes as he painfully stood up, every shift and every movement causing immense, unbearable pain upon his body. Soldering through it, he grasped the limp arm of the wayward Uchiha Sasuke and hoisted him up, pulling him over his shoulder.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he took a wobbly step, displacing whatever remained of his energy to his legs as he took another step and another step, another step, another step.</p><p>I will not break this promise.</p><p>I will not die.</p><p>I will not deteriorate.</p><p>Strength anew, he trudged down the wet, mud caked grass of the forests, blocking out the unbearable pain in his chest after each and every step, not wavering with his movements.</p><p>Within several minutes, Naruto Uzumaki vanished into the misty of the rain, carrying the unconscious body of Uchiha Sasuke with him.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>The rain drizzled endlessly, hailing millions of droplets down upon the youthful trees as the rain water flooded downhill, towards a chaotic sight of environmental destruction.</p><p>Thousands of trees lay scattered, splintered and torn, on the forest floor, its leaves blown across the wet, abandoned destruction. The smell of blood filled the air, leaving a disgusting scent to flood the forests nearby, warding off any predators looking for their next feast.</p><p>Crimson, red blood trickled down into the cold water, staining the dirty water within the rubble as a faint, small breaths echoed within the silent destruction, emanating underneath the rubble, hiding a young, crippled teen from the world.</p><p>Her crimson red hair lay flat on the cold, muddy dirt, her cheeks and forehead stained with brown smudges as she ferociously glared at the tree that lay above her head, gritting her teeth in anger.</p><p>I'm not gonna die…</p><p>I'm not gonna die…</p><p>I am not going to die…</p><p>The teen repeated the mantra in her head, fighting for hope of survival as she coughed violently, blood dripping from her mouth. Spitting the bloody liquid into the small water puddle next to her, she focused her thoughts on escape as she assessed her current situation, her training kicking into effect.</p><p>The trees was crushing her pelvis, pinning her to the floor heavily. Damage sustained is heavy, from what she can judge; the spinal sustained light damage (thank fuckin heavens), arms heavily damaged, light concussion on her head. The real problem was her leg; her inability to feel her right leg, along with the constant blood puddle by it, most likely indicating her leg is bleeding heavily, lacking the appropriate amount of blood to feel her leg properly. Her left leg was a different story, it was slightly damaged, probably just scratches or scars, and had sufficient room to move and rotate around. From what she can see, she'd lost a lot of blood from her wounds, leading her to an inevitable ending; she'd bleed to death before she got out of this damn thing.</p><p>Her mind processed the information, forming a plan.</p><p>The only thing trapping her underneath was the tree that was crushing her pelvis, she could try to lift it high enough to slip out but her leg was stuck.</p><p>She needed to clear her leg free of her debris to continue with her plan.</p><p>Using her left leg, she started to kick the debris above her right leg, hoping to let it become unstuck. Pain flooded her immediately, her voice letting out a gasp of agony.</p><p>With every moment she makes, the tree crushed down on her pelvis.</p><p>Gritting her teeth, she tried again, kicking off loose branches as the tree started to crush her pelvis, forcing pain to flood her once more except this time, she was ready. Torturous pain filled her pelvis as she continued, fighting for her slim chance of survival.</p><p>Say what you want about her but Tayuya is definitely no quitter.</p><hr size=1 noshade><p><i>Drip….<br>Drip….<br>Drip….<br>Screech…</i></p><p>Bright, luminous, red eyes cracked open within the dark room, glaring through the iron bars of the Jinchuuriki's domain as it scanned for the unusual sound. The room was empty, several pipes ran across the ceilings and walls as black water partially flooded the room. A figure emerged from behind the bars, dressed in a black kimono as it strode across the knee high water, getting the lower half of her dress wet as she glanced up at the seal.</p><p>The seal was fine albeit the worrying tear that was in the middle of it.</p><p>The woman grinned as she turned away from the gates, vanishing to the darkness as her laughter echoed in the cage.</p><p>Her mind plotted, her sexy, luscious red lips curling to an evil smirk as she brushed away her shiny crimson red hair away from her luminous orange eyes as bright red marks appeared within the air on front of her, scrambling into letters and sentences.</p><p>She wanted out and the only way out was to break that seal. She had tried endlessly to escape but such luck as the seal stayed strong…until now.</p><p>All seals stayed strong, everlasting but even so, seals can be broken. The Fourth Hokage's seal was the strongest of them all, powered by his chakra but no seal, no mortal seal on earth, can fully withstand a full blast of demonic chakra within its core.</p><p>That tear was her ticket out of this hell hole.</p><p>Reading the red context in the air, Kyu smirked as her plan developed.</p><p><b>Zack: Well that does it for the prologue, it's fairly short but the chapters will be longer, probably about 4-5 thousand words or so but that is just an estimate so no promises.</b></p><p><b>Anyway, I hope you loyal fans will like this rewritten version and I'll try to post whenever I can.</b></p><p><b>R&R!</b></p><p><b>S.O.S<br>(Signing Out Suckers)<br>Zackary Summers</b></p>
