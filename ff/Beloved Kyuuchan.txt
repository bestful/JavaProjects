Inspired by Jigoku Shoujo Futakomori ep. 3</P><hr></P><P>It had been a fine day and a very
excited blue-eyed boy exited his apartment. School has finally
resumed and he is finally in 6th grade. Whats more? He
could finally get to meet someone he had missing for so long. The boy
quickly ran towards a tall handsome, red-haired man. "Ohayo
Kyuu-chan!! Genki desu ka?" He greeted the man and in turn,
'Kyuu-chan' greeted him with a smile.</P><P>"Ohayo Naru-chan! I'm very much fine.
Let me introduce you to my boyfriend. We just got together this
summer. Anyway, this is Uchiha Itachi. Itachi, this is Uzumaki
Naruto, my best friend." The said man step forward and bowed
slightly to Naruto showing respect.</P><P>"Ohayo Naruto-kun. I am pleased to
meet you."</P><P>"I am too! You have a good-looking
boyfriend Kyuu-chan!!" Kyuubi just chuckled. While Itachi looked
at him proudly.</P><P>"I'm glad you approved of me
Naruto-kun" Naruto just grinned at him.</P><P>"Of course I do! As long as you make
Kyuu-chan happy, then I have no problem with it! Well, I got to go,
see you later Kyuu-chan!!" Naruto said softly, waving his hand as
he went to his classroom.</P><P>Kyuubi stopped on his tracks and
observed Naruto's disappearing body. <I>He's acting a little strange.
I wonder what's bothering him? </I>Before
Kyuubi could dwell on the thoughts he heard Itachi calling him.</P><P>"Kyuubi-kun, are
you coming? We're going to get late." Itachi said calmly, hiding
his irritation through his emotionless and low melodic voice.</P><P>"Yeah, I'm
coming!" Kyuubi said as he went to his class.</P><P>The
day passed quickly and when it finally is the time to leave the
school campus, Naruto proceed to walk to the school playground, where
he and Kyuubi usually meet after school. Naruto sighed as he begin to
think. <I>It had been a long time since I last saw Kyuubi.
Summer vacation isn't worth being away from him. He had changed a
lot. No longer was he in his cold, mysterious and serious mood but he
was rather cheerful and open. It looks like he really is happy with
Itachi. -sigh-. I'm supposed to be happy, damn it! Kyuu-chan's happy
so what more could I possible ask? </I>At
this, images of Itachi and kyuubi walking together, smiling and
laughing flashed on his mind.</P><P>The mere thought of
them being together made his insides turn, and something inside him
scream, trying to break free, to go to Kyuubi's arms and be held by
that strong muscular body and spend time together with his best
friend, his love. But a part of him also tried to restrain it and
tried to convince himself that Kyuubi is happy with someone who can
take care of him and so, he should be happy with that.</P><P>Naruto sighed again
for the second time. Debating with his inner self and finally, when
he decided that maybe it's best to let go of Kyuubi and just be happy
about it, he felt hollow inside, like something is missing. Naruto
just shook his head and convinced himself that everything is fine.</P><P>Naruto was
interrupted from his thoughts by a guard. "Kid, its already 6 pm.
You should go home" The school guard told him gently.</P><P>He
blinked. He hadn't realized that it was already this late.
Remembering why he here, he begin to worry about Kyuubi. <I>Why
isn't he here yet? </I>Naruto
decided to ask the school guard.</P><P>"Uhm, I was
waiting for my friend. Did you happen to know about him? His name is
kyuubi."</P><P>The guard just
sighed and led Naruto to the small guardhouse just beside the school
gate. "See here?" He opened a student attendance notebook. "The
one you have been looking for left the campus at 4:10 pm. 10 minutes
just after the class ended. And I suggest you sign your name here and
run along. When something happens to you, we don't want the school
getting blamed."</P><P>Naruto just nodded
dumbly and signed his name as he left the school. He wasn't really
sure how to react. He was there waiting for him and he didn't even
bothered to come. It was a ritual for both of them to come to that
place right after school. And now, Naruto was puzzled and worried,
but what he saw next drove him to rage.</P><P>Just
across their apartment is a restaurant, with Kyuubi and Itachi
laughing together, looking really happy and satisfied with each
other's presence. But instead of going there, his shoulders sag and
his head dropped. <I>I guess he didn't need me then. But no
matter, I'll always loved him. </I>At
this thought, Naruto started
to feel better. <I>Yeah, and I'll definitely protect him from
afar, not that that Itachi guy cant, but I am the great Naruto. I
should support his decision. </I>Naruto
grinned sadly to himself and entered his apartment.</P><P>Naruto started to
do his homework. When he was halfway done, he heard a click and saw
the next room lighted up. He decided to check on Kyuubi and decided
to knock on his window. (If you watched the episode on Jigoku Shoujo
you would know.) Which was later opened by a worried Kyuubi.
"Naru-chan..."</P><P>"Hey Kyuu-chan!
How did your date went?" Kyuubi slightly turned red.</P><P>"How did you
know?"</P><P>"Well, duh, I saw
you. After all, the restaurant was just across the apartment!"</P><P>"Oh yeah!"
Kyuubi chuckled and Naruto joined in laughing.</P><P>"Well, it went
fine, at first. But something came up." Kyuubi's voice turned sad.</P><P>"What? What
happened?" Naruto asked, full of concern.</P><P>"Well, Itachi-koi
said he wanted for our relationship to go deeper, and that he wanted
to have a vacation on Hawaii. You know that we have no class next
week right? He wanted to spend time with me there."</P><P>Naruto bit his lip
and just waited for Kyuubi to continue. "Well, I sort of low on
cash. You think you know a few available jobs that I-" He was cut
of by Naruto who shoved a plastic card in front of him.</P><P>"What's this?"</P><P>"Well, its
supposed to be my allowance for this month, but I hate to see you go
to work, so you can use that for your vacation."</P><P>"But Naru-chan!
What about you?"</P><P>"No, its ok,
really. I just wanted you to enjoy yourself. Take care of yourself
Kyuu-chan!" He grinned assuring Kyuubi that everything would be
fine.</P><P>Kyuubi grinned in
return. "Thanks Naruto. You have no idea how much this means to
me." Naruto just blushed as Kyuubi retrieved the card.</P><P>"Well, thanks for
this Naru-chan! Thank you very much."</P><P>"I'm glad you
appreciate it, but you better be careful. I don't want Kyuu-chan to
return here with a missing limb!" Naruto joke while Kyuubi laughed.</P><P>"I would. Now go
to sleep Naru-chan! Oyasumi!" Naruto only nodded and mumbled a soft
"Oyasumi" before going back to his homework.</P><P>The day passed by
quickly and soon, next week had finally arrived. Naruto decided to
accompany Kyuubi at the airport to say good bye to his beloved
Kyuu-chan.</P><P>"Kyuu-chan have
fun!!" Naruto said cheerfully. He had finally accepted about
Kyuubi and Itachi's relationship without getting upset or something.
But as he led Kyuubi towards the airplane, he cant help but get a bad
feeling of an impending danger.</P><P>Kyuubi just grinned
at him "Don't worry about me Naru-chan! I'll always return in one
piece."</P><P>"You better
be. So I guess I'll see you later?"</P><P>"Sure. See you
later!!" And just like that, the plane finally took its flight
away from Japan.</P><P>It had been the
third day since Kyuubi left with his boyfriend and Naruto cant help
getting depressed. He missed his beloved Kyuu-chan. He tried
forgetting about him by drowning himself with ramen but even the
sacred food haven't done anything to cheer him up.</P><P>Naruto groaned. He
know that this week would be full of loneliness.</P><P>Well, that's all I
can think for today so I guess I'll see you all later! Reviews are
not a necessity, but an inspiration! See you all!!</P>
