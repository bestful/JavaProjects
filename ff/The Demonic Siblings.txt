story.</B></P><P><B>Chapter
one – The Brothers</B></P><P>It
was a bright and sunny morning in Konohagakure, or The Village Hidden
In The Leaves, well, for most people it was. For two kids, it meant
constantly running and trying to escape from being beaten nearly to
death. But, as fate would have it, today was not different for these
two kids.</P><P>The
Hokage, The Sandaime, also known as Sarutobi, had decreed a law that
made it so no one could tell the boys they were Jinchuurikis, a human
sacrifice to make sure the demons, though, they were bijuus, great
beasts with unimaginable power. It was today that Naruto, and his
brother Shadow, were trapped at a dead end and were scared for their
life.</P><P>"You
bastard demons! You killed our families and took away our Yondaime
Hokage!" One person yelled from the mob.</P><P>"Yeah!
We're going to finish what the Yondaime and his wife couldn't!
We're going to kill you for good!" Another person yelled out and
the mob began closing in.</P><P>The
two kids tried their best to hold out but couldn't. They passed
out, and each entered their own mind. Here they met their 'inner
demon', if you will. However, what happened next, surprised them
both.</P><P>Naruto
awoke in a sewer like area, only to see a pathway, and began
following it. When he reached the end, he found a large cage with a
piece of paper on it with the word 'Yondaime', he was curious as
to what was behind it. He got his answer.</P><P>"<B>Come
closer Kit." It said</B></P><P>Naruto
moved closer, only to have to jump back from being shredded from the
massive claws.</P><P>"<B>Gah!
I would shred you if not for this cage! Damn you Yondaime for sealing
me and my best friend into your kids!!!" The great beast roared. It
looked down at Naruto and found the young boy staring at her. She was
now in her human form.</B></P><P>"HOLY
FUCKING SHIT!" That was the only thing he could think of. He and
his brother were the sons of the Yondaime Hokage!? Well, go figure.
So, he decided to ask the beast…. Girl… thing, a question.</P><P>"Hey,
what's your name?" Naruto asked her.</P><P>"<B>My
name is Kyuubi, well, at least that's what you humans call me. My
real name is Hitomi (Pupil, given to girls with beautiful eyes.). Why
do ask mortal?" She said with venom.</B></P><P>"Geez,
Just asking a simple question. Anyways, beautiful name for a
beautiful girl." He said, oblivious to the blush she now had. Well,
that was until he woke up in the hospital with see the Sandaime
sitting in a chair.</P><P>---------------------------Scene
Break. Now to where Shadow encountered his demon-------------------</P><P>Shadow
was slowly walking down a dark path that led to a very large cage
with a piece of paper on it with the word "Mikoto". He was
curious of the seal.</P><P>"So,
this is the seal that holds back the eight tailed beast Hachimata no
Orochi. Second to Kyuubi, the nine tailed beast, and best friend of
her as well. Never thought Orochi would be a girl as well."</P><P>Now,
when you approach a demon's place, you'd best be ready for
anything. Hopefully, anything. What happened next didn't quite
catch him off guard. He saw a tail shoot out to grab him, but he
didn't move, knowing it wouldn't reach him. He smiled as it
stopped a few inches from him.</P><P>"So,
the great Orochi decides to show herself." Shadow said.</P><P>"<B>Hmmm,
your smarter then your brother Naruto, Shadow. You know more then you
let on. And yes, Kyuubi was my best friend and we're both girls."
She said as she appeared with long silver hair and golden eyes.</B></P><P>"So,
you have name other then the one we gave you like Kyuubi is Hitomi?"</P><P>"<B>Yes.
My real name is Tsuki (Moon). Also, it seems your brother and you
have a mental connection so you can talk to each other, and me and
Hitomi have one as well. This way we can communicate with each other
no matter what." She said, eyeing Shadow.</B></P><P>"Hmmm,
sounds very useful. Indeed, this could be quite useful to use it for
training." He said, thinking.</P><P>"<B>Well,
it seems it's time for you to go. Your brother just woke up, and so
you will too. We will talk later farewell for now." She said making
him wake up.</B></P><P>Now
Shadow woke up the same time as Naruto, only to see the Sandaime
sitting a chair.</P><P>--------------------------------------Scene
Break--------------------------------------------</P><P>The
Hokage was waiting patiently for the two boys to wake up. He saw them
sit up and smiled. He asked Shadow what happened.</P><P>"Shadow,
what happened?" He asked in a grandfather like tone.</P><P>"Well,
the mob decided to try and kill us, but that was most likely not
going happen to due to us having demons inside of us." He saw the
Hokage stiffen at this.</P><P>"Don't
worry. They mean no harm now. Besides, they might even help us
train." The Hokage was now curious about this. Why would demons
teach these two boys? He decided to ask later.</P><P>"Well,
I'm guessing that you met Hitomi Naruto?" Naruto nodded to this.
"I met Tsuki." The Sandaime was now very worried.</P><P>"Do
not fret Oji-san. Although it saddens me that our father mother gave
theirs lives to seal the Bijuus inside of us, we shall become greater
than them both." He finished while smiling the entire time.</P><P>"Alright
Shadow, thank you for telling me this. I believe Naruto would've
told me the same?" Naruto nodded. "Very well. Do you know who
your parents are?"</P><P>Shadow
nodded. "Yes. Our father was the Yondaime. Minato Namikaze." The
Hokage nodded at this. "Our mother was the princess of the
whirlpool, Kushina Uzumaki." The Hokage nodded again.</P><P>He
then spoke "Do you know of your bloodlines then?"</P><P>Shadow
shook his head. "No, but I believe we have Steel Body and the
Shingan."</P><P>"That
you do. Also, both of you are elemental masters. Able to use all
elements perfectly." The Hokage said while smiling. These two kids
would be the best shinobi that Konoha has seen in many years.</P><P>The
Hokage stood up. "Alright boys, you are free to go and come to my
office tomorrow morning. We shall discuss this then and you will
learn what both of the bloodlines do. Until then, see you later."
The Hokage then left.</P><P>Naruto
and Shadow both got up and left. Shadow looked at Naruto.</P><P>"Don't
worry. Just wait until we show all these people who we are the sons
of. Then they will respect us." Naruto nodded.</P><P>"Yeah,
it's about time we some respect about here. Anyways, let's go
home and go to sleep. We gotta see Oji-san in the morning!" He said
and they both ran home thinking everything over and smiling the whole
time.</P><P>They
both got home and ate their dinner and got ready for bed. They
climbed into their beds and fell asleep. They just couldn't wait
for tomorrow.</P><P><B>Well
first chapter is done oh and shadow is Vegeta-Taisho's character
which he let me use. No bad flames like go stab yourself. I prefer
ones that tell why it sucks</B></P>

2 - The Explanation and Training</B></P><P>We
find our two heroes just waking up from their sleep after talking
with the Hokage the day before. They got up and each took a shower,
then prepared some ramen and ate it, then got dressed, and left for
the Hokage Tower.</P><P>They
walked through the back ways of Konoha to get to the Hokage Tower to
avoid being beaten. They arrived a few minutes later and waited for
the Hokage to see them.</P><P>The
Sandaime appeared and smiled gently at them, telling them to come in.
They followed and each sat down and waited for the Hokage to start
explaining everything to them.</P><P>Sandaime
sighed gently and looked at the two boys. Already they have been
subjected to severe beatings and assassination attempts on their
lives, all because they harbored the two most powerful demons (<B>he
didn't know they were bijuus</B>),
but a select few see past that.</P><P>He
looked at them and thought of a way to tell them of their parents the
best way he could.</P><P>"Okay,
you two. What I'm going to tell you will never leave this room.
Understood?" He said this in a stern voice that suggested no
argument. They two kids nodded letting him know they understood.</P><P>He
continued "Your parents were the greatest shinobi this village has
ever seen. Your mother was Uzumaki Kushina, and your father was
Namikaze Minato, the Yondaime Hokage."</P><P>Naruto
and Shadow looked at the Hokage, both in awe, their parents were the
strongest this village had ever seen? 'Well,' they thought, 'time
to make our parents proud, we'll exceed them and become the best
shinobi the world has ever seen!' They thought together. The
Sandaime continued on "Your father realized that what he was going
to do was going to cost him his life, and his wife also realized
this, and she also learned the Shiki Fuuin (sp?), which was a smart
move for her to learn. It made so when the Kyuubi and Hachimata
attacked, they both were to be sealed. Our village is lucky you two
were born that night, otherwise we all would have been killed.
However, your parents left you everything they have for you two:
House, money, clothing, jutsus, even your father's specialized
kunai, which allowed him to do his Hiraishin no jutsu <B>(1)</B>,
also, there are scrolls on the Steel Body and the Shingan, your two
bloodlines." He paused to allow this to sink in and catch his
breathe. He continued "Now, your house can be found underneath the
Yondaime monument on the Hokage Mountain. Here are the keys to your
new clan house. I've taken the liberty of having it cleaned and
restocked." He handed the keys to Shadow, who nodded and smiled
along with Naruto.</P><P>The
Sandaime added a final small part to this explanation "Also, you
two will be able to practice polygamy, which will allow you to marry
multiple wives, this way, you can restore your clan." He finished
with that and laughed gently, seeing the two kids blush from it.</P><P>Shadow
was first to speak "Hokage-sama, thank you for telling us this. We
appreciate it." He stood up and bowed.</P><P>Naruto
stood and bowed as well. He then decided to talk "We will not tell
any about this unless you say we can. We will see you later
Hokage-sama."</P><P>The
Sandaime was surprised by the 'sama' part, but he didn't mind.
He guessed Naruto was finally happy, as was Shadow.</P><P>------------------------------------------------Scene
Change-------------------------------------------</P><P>Sarios
Kordaka is part of the Dragon clan, Possessor's of the powerful
Ryuugan and dragon summoning contract. The Ryuugan when activated
turns the eyes a deep emerald green color with 5 blues tomes in the
shape of diamonds. They wander through all of the elemental land of
fire. Today they have arrived in Konoha and have decided to stay here
until Sarios becomes a shinobi.</P><P>Lupal
Kordaka Sarios's mother tells him to go find some children to play
with and to stay out of trouble. Sarios says "ok mom I will" and
runs off to find some kids to play with. Not looking where he was
going he bumps into two kids who are staring at the mountain face
"oops sorry about that. My name's Sarios Kordaka what yours?"
the two brothers said "I'm Naruto Namikaze" "And I'm Shadow
Namikaze, I'm Naruto's brother". 'Nice to meet you
Naruto-san, Shadow-san would you like to be friends and play some?"
Sarios asked. "Sure Sarios-san what would you like to play?"
Shadow asked. "Ummm how bout hide and seek!" Sarios said, "Ok"
the brothers said in unison. Then a bunch of kids walked by and
noticed the brothers and decided to bully them. They kids walked up
to Sarios and knocked him out of the way telling Naruto and Shadow
"they don't deserve friends because they are freaks", then
Sarios got up and his eyes where a deep emerald green color with a
blue diamond shaped tomoe spinning around the orange slitted pupil
"leave my friends alone assholes" he said. "Oh yeah and what if
we don't what will you do then?" the leader of the group asked
Sarios did some hand seals and said "This <B>Dragon
style: Raining Hell Fire!</B>"
placing the boys in a genjutsu that made them think they were in hell
and it was raining fire, so even Kurenai would have trouble with it.
Within 30 seconds they were out cold so Sarios released the jutsu and
his eyes returned to their normal grey color. "Whew that took a lot
more out of me than I thought it would" Sarios said scratching the
back of his head. "Well Sarios-san that was impressive but it's
getting late so we'll head home see you tomorrow" the Brothers
said.</P><P>------------------------------------------------Scene
Change-------------------------------------------</P><P>Naruto
and Shadow both left Sarios feeling happy for the first time ever
because now they had a friend to play with and talk with. They
decided to find out who he really was and if he has a kekke genkai
(sp?).</P><P>They
continued to walk and think over everything the Sandaime told them.
They still couldn't believe it! Their father, the Yondaime, but the
resemblances were there. The spiky blonde hair, they ocean blue eyes,
anything you saw in the Yondaime, showed in Shadow and Naruto. Their
new names are now Namikaze Naruto, and Namikaze Shadow. They finally
arrived at the Monument and walked underneath it and saw a large
house with a spiral on it. 'Yup. This is it.'</P><P>They
walked up to the door and opened it. When they entered, they were awe
struck. "Wow." was all they could say together. The house looked
to be almost three times the size of the Hyuuga Clan House, and that
was huge! It made the Hyuuga's house look like their old apartment.
They looked around and finally found the library, which was huge! It
had jutsus from E-rank all the way to SS-rank jutsus. They vowed to
try and learn everything in the library.</P><P>They
went upstairs and each found a large room with their names on it. It
seems their parents wanted them to be comfortable in the house and
already filled their closets with clothes that would fit them
perfectly. They also had a set of clothes that made them look like
the Yondaime.</P><P>They
went back downstairs and into the library. They each took E-ranked
scrolls and began to practice with them. The first three they worked
on were the Kawarimi (body replacement technique), Henge
(transformation technique), and the Bunshin (clone technique) no
jutsus.</P><P>They
could do the first two easily, but the Bunshin was always screwed up
and it looked dead, or mutated. They realized they had too much
chakra for such a low level technique. Shadow decided to find another
Bunshin-type technique. He found what he was looking for in the
A-ranked section. It was called Kage Bunshin No Jutsu (shadow clone
jutsu).</P><P>He
brought the scroll back and he and Naruto both read the scroll and
tried it. Naruto was first to try out the technique. He placed his
hands into a cross like seal and shouted the jutsu "SHADOW CLONE
JUTSU!" Instantly, fifteen clones appeared and all looked perfect.
He smiled. This technique was golden.</P><P>Shadow
then placed his hands in the same seal and shouted the technique
"SHADOW CLONE JUSTU!" Fifteen perfect copies appeared just like
Naruto's did as well. He rolled the scroll up and placed it back in
the A-rank section. He then moved on and found a scroll on the
Shingan and Sharigan. He took them and walked back to Naruto.</P><P>"Here
are the scrolls on our bloodlines. Let's start with the Shingan."
He said as he unrolled the scroll and Naruto nodded.</P><P><I>The
Kazama Bloodline limit is called the Shingan. The eyes are golden in
appearance and as a Kazama grows the eyes grows tear shaped tomoes
will appear.</I></P><P><I>That
is a sign of the Shingan growing. The final Shingan level is that of
a golden eye with six tomoes.</I></P><P><I>Level
one Shingan: Allows Analysis Mode to be used. This allows the user to
see their strength, speed & morale. This helps the user to know
what to pick on in a fight. This mode grows with the user, as it
allows us to see Chakra, chakra levels, spiritual energies and other
things like emotions.</I></P><P><I>Level
2 Shingan Two Tomoe: Allows us to see things in slower motion, so our
bodies can react to it faster. Beware Kazama Family, because if your
body cannot react fast enough you will still get hit. This form also
allows us to copy techniques.</I></P><P><I>Level
3 Shingan Three tomoes: This is the kicker, the ability to copy
bloodlines. This made the Kazama family wanted throughout the Shinobi
countries for this ability. Most of us were hunted and killed for our
abilities others were kidnapped with intention of being made into
weapons of destruction. Kazamas are naturally warm hearted and we
will only fight for what we believe in. For that most of us were
killed.</I></P><P>Naruto
and Shadow shedded some tears after reading that part.</P><P><I>Level
4 Shingan 4 tomoes: This is an interesting form of Shingan. It allows
the user to make special traps that can be activated in the Kazama's
mind. Also traps regenerate after a while. Also it allows the user to
copy any kind of writing and store it in ones mind. This includes
battle plans, scrolls and lists for the Kazama men that are whipped
by their wives.</I></P><P>Naruto
and Shadow started laughing at that but then stopped. They realized
they could end up like that.</P><P><I>Level
5 Shingan 5 tomoes: This allows us to master bloodline techniques
copied to their fullest. These eyes can copy Mangekyou Sharingan,
Byakugen no Ten and even Clan techniques.</I></P><P><I>Not
many Kazama's make it to this level.</I></P><P><I>Level
6 Shingan 6 tomoes: This is Kazama power at its rawest, this fully
evolved Shingan allows us to read minds, take memories away, implant
false memories or wipe their mind clean. Another ability of this form
is to Shingan Bunshin No Jutsu. This allows the user to make an exact
replica of anyone. It can copy things such as powers, nature and even
chakra capacities. Only draw back to the Shingan Bunshin No Jutsu as
it drains a lot of chakra, approximately 90 percent of it. Only one
Kazama lived this long to achieve it, my grandfather, the first head
of the family Kazama Kopachi.</I></P><P>Shadow
then rolled up the scroll and sighed gently. "Well, it seems this
bloodline is the greatest in all of the countries if what this scroll
says is true. Well, it seems me and you will have to keep the Kazama
family name alive." He yawned and he unrolled the Steel Body
scroll.</P><P><I><B>Steel
Body</B></I><I>
is the bloodline of the Uzumaki clan. It makes ones bones become a
type of black unbreakable metal that is called adamantium and it
allows the user to cover their body with that metal and wear it like
armor and then retract it into their body when ever they want. Plus
they can control all the metal around them up to a certain degree and
distance</I><I><B>.
</B></I><I>You
can't lose limbs or be beheaded but a stab to the heart or poison
will still kill you if your not careful. Once you have mastered your
control of the Steel Body it will automatically protect you with
metal armor if you are in danger.</I></P><P>"Well,"
Naruto stated, "that's pretty fricken' cool of the Steel body
and Shingan I can't wait to master them both.</P><P>Shadow
rolled up the scroll and walked back to the scroll section and put
them back, and yawned loudly.</P><P>"Alright,
I think it's time we went to bed." Naruto nodded and they went
upstairs and fell asleep instantly.</P><P>-----------------------------------------------Scene
Change--------------------------------------</P><P>After
a refreshing night's sleep, our two heroes wake up and head to the
library. When they enter the library, they go the D-ranked scroll
section and pull out various scrolls.</P><P>Shadow
learned that Kage bunshins help you learn techniques, or other
various items. They created fifteen clones each and began to work on
the jutsus.</P><P>The
first one Naruto decided to learn was Fire Style: Great Fireball
Jutsu, He got that down fairly quick. He moved onto another one, only
this time, it was a C-rank one. It was the Fire Style: Dragon Flame
Jutsu.</P><P>He
decided to learn water Jutsu as well. This jutsu was a bit harder for
him to learn. But it was Water Style: Gunshot. He could feel he used
about half of his chakra so far, so he decided to go for an A-ranked
jutsu.</P><P>He
looked through a scroll and came across mass shadow clone Jutsu. It
took him about two hours to master it, but he did. He felt himself
extremely low on chakra and decided to rest for awhile.</P><P>-----------------------------------------------Scene
Break----------------------------------------------</P><P>Sarios
woke up early in the morning and started to do his warm-ups before he
went out to train in the forest. His warm ups include 100 pushups,
100 sit-ups, 100 laps around the house, 100 squats, 200 punches, 200
kicks, and 100 jump ropes. In an hour and a half he was done so he
went to fix some eggs, bacon and pancakes. By the time he had
finished cooking and eating his mom woke up and asked "did you do
your warm-ups already?" "Yes mom I did it in 93 minutes" Sarios
proudly stated "oh and I unlocked the first stage of my Ryuugan!"
Lupal fainted because no one had ever activated it that early in
their life. When Lupal woke up she said "I never expected you to
activate it that fast how did you do it?" "Well" Sarios began
"I was walking looking for some kids to play with like you asked
and I found these two brothers, their names were Naruto and Shadow
Namikaze We were going to play but some other kids showed up and hit
knocking me down and called Naruto and Shadow freaks and then
something in me snapped I heard a voice inside me tell me to channel
chakra into my eyes then told my the hand seals and name of a
genjutsu which I used on them to make them stop. Lupal sighed knowing
this wasn't going to be an easy explanation "Sarios what do you
know of the bijuu?" "Well I know that there are only nine of them
and most have been sealed" Sarios answered. "Come here I will
take you into your mind there is something I wish you to see" "Ok
mom". Less than a minute later they were in Sarios mind. They were
walking through a forest toward a hill that had a cave in it. When
they got there they saw that there was a seal with the kanji for
dragon lying on the floor at the entrance. As they walked up to it
they heard a low rumble. They stopped just in front of the seal and
looked into the cave and a giant ball of green fire flew out of the
cave and stopped at the entrance. They looked down to see the seal
glowing, they realized that the seal kept the fire and whatever made
it inside and unable to harm anything outside of the cave. They heard
something large moving inside and a giant green dragon head appears
from the depths of the cave and looks at them. Sarios's eyes go
wide and he asks "Who are you and where are we?" "I am Aoikaen
the 7 tailed dragon and the third strongest Bijuu, and this place is
you mindscape. You control everything here, you can shape everything
here to your liking or someone else's liking." "And since I do
not know the names of the one I am sealed in who are you and the
female?" "I am Lupal Kordaka and this is my son Sarios Kordaka,
you used to be the guardian of reigakure (<B>village
hidden in the spirit did I spell that right???) </B>And
long ago your father gifted us with the Ryuugan remember?" "Ah
yes now I'm starting to remember I was sealed during the war after
suffering a mortal wound and your clan leader Garkos sealed me inside
of your son Sarios. Well I that I have recovered my memory and know
who I am in I'll offer you two a deal rip off a third of the seal
so I can sense what Sarios senses and talk to him while he is awake
so I can teach him some of my demonic jutsus so he can better protect
himself and me, Because if you die little one I die as well."
"Don't worry Aoikaen I'll be strong enough to protect us both
and then I'll restore the clan!" Sarios promised as he ripped off
a third of the seal.</P><P>-----------------------------------------------Scene
Break----------------------------------------------</P><P>Shadow
took three C-rank scrolls, two B-rank scrolls, and one A-ranked
scroll. He opened the first C-rank one. It was Fire Style: Dragon
Flame Jutsu. It took hi about fifteen minutes to make a good size
dragon appear.</P><P>His
second C-rank one was Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu, which took
about half an hour to master.</P><P>His
third C-rank scroll was water clone Jutsu. It took only fifteen
minutes to get this down.</P><P>He
opened his first B-rank scroll and it was Water Style: Water Dragon
Jutsu. This took thirty minutes to get a good grip on.</P><P>His
second B-rank jutsu was Fire Style: Dragon Flame Bomb. This took
around forty minutes to complete.</P><P>He
opened his A-rank scroll and it was Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu. This
took about half an hour to master and he was rather low on chakra
after he finished learning all of these jutsus.</P><P>He
rolled the scrolls back up and placed them back where they belong.
Naruto also did this.</P><P>"So,"
Shadow started, "low on chakra as well?" He looked at Naruto to
see him sweating.</P><P>"Yeah,"
Naruto said, "those jutsus are extremely hard. I found some chakra
control exercises we can do later. Hopefully we can do them right."
He finished.</P><P>"Oh?
What were the exercises?" Shadow asked.</P><P>"They
are tree climbing, water walking, kunai balancing, and kunai
hovering." Naruto stated.</P><P>"The
last two sound quite difficult. But we'll do them no matter what!"
Shadow exclaimed.</P><P>"Indeed
we will brother, indeed we will." Naruto said. "Well, lets take a
break and continue some of this later." Shadow nodded to this.
Training like this for the next four years would be difficult, but it
will prove to be extremely great for these two kids.</P>

3 Graduation</B></P><P>It
had been a long seven years for our two heroes. First learning of
their mother and father. Their father was the famed "Yellow Flash
of Konoha" or <I>Konoha
no Kīroi Senkō</I> and
their mother was Uzumaki Kushina. Naruto and his brother Shadow were
overjoyed that they had a family, but were saddened that they were
all dead. They were the last of their clan, well Namikaze Clan
anyways. The fact that they met Sarios Kordaka who as it turned out
had they 7 tailed Bijuu sealed in him and he was the heir to his
clan. The three were sitting in the back of the class, looking out
the window. Iruka was explaining what was to be on the final exam to
become a Genin. Sarios, Naruto, and Shadow both chuckled lightly at
hearing what was for the final.</P><P>"Hey,
Naruto," his brother whispered "This test is nothing."</P><P>"Yeah,"
Naruto whispered back.</P><P>Apparently
Iruka heard them because he turned around and stared angrily at the
two Namikaze's (though no one knew lol). Iruka heard something
outside and saw Kiba had snuck out again and went to find him,
leaving them with Mizuki.</P><P>"Alright
class!" Mizuki shouted "Today we will be reviewing the Henge!
Line up!"</P><P>One
by one, they all lined and performed the technique flawlessly. All
that was left was Naruto, Shadow, and Sarios.</P><P>Sarios
went and with a smile turned into a medium sized green 2 tailed
dragon causing Mizuki, and all the other students to gape in awe
except Naruto and Shadow who had seen it before.</P><P>"Naruto,
do <I>that</I> Jutsu."
Shadow chuckled.</P><P>"Alright."
Naruto took his place and started gathering chakra to do a Henge.
There was a 'poof' sound, and, instead of a Mizuki, was a
voluptuous blonde with clouds of smoke barely covering the
essentials.</P><P>Everything
was quiet for a minute. Even when Iruka and Kiba came back in, they
stared. Everyone stared. Then, Mizuki got a massive nosebleed as did
Iruka.</P><P>Everyone
started laughing and Naruto transformed back to normal laughing his
ass off. Shadow and Sarios were forced to hold their sides as they
couldn't hold it in.</P><P>"Alright,
enough!!!!!" Shouted Iruka. He walked up to the front of class and
bonked Naruto on the head.</P><P>"Owww!
What was that for!?" "Because, you should not use those
Jutsu's!!"</P><P>Shadow
stepped and wiped the water away from his eyes. 'Man, I didn't
think he was gonna use that one! Whatever, my turn.' He waited for
the signal.</P><P>He
got the signal and a 'poof' sound was heard. In place of Shadow,
was a perfect replica of the Yondaime.</P><P>Everyone
stared at him for a minute, before the girls were 'awwwwing and
ooooohing' at the sight of him. Shadow then changed back.</P><P>"Very
good." Said Iruka. He was proud that Shadow was mature enough not
to do such a disgraceful jutsu.</P><P>He
walked back to his seat and sat, and started cracking up for no
reason. Everyone stared at him before back at Iruka who sighed and
waited. Five minutes later, Shadow stopped. He resumed the lesson.</P><P>-After
school, at Naruto and Shadow's house-</P><P>"I
can't believed you used that jutsu! That was the last one I was
expecting you to use, but whatever! You choose what ones you use. At
least, don't die, alright?" Shadow may have been older, smarter
and mature, but he always worried for his brother Naruto. "Yeah
warn us next time alright Naruto?" Sarios asked.</P><P>Naruto
just nodded his head. "Alright. By the way, what level is your
Shingan brother and Sarios what level is your Ryuugan?" He
subconsciously activated his to the level three form.</P><P>Shadow
activated his to the level three form as well. "I'm guessing
we're extremely close to the fourth level. Night fight or spar we
have, we should be there."</P><P>"I
am only level two considering how hard mine is to level but I believe
the next all out fight we have will advance me to level three"
Sarios said.</P><P>"By
the way weren't you going to show us the scroll about your
bloodline Sarios?" Shadow asked.</P><P>"Only
if we all graduate" Sarios stated.</P><P>"Alright!
This has to be the best bloodline ever!" Naruto happily exclaimed.</P><P>"Indeed
it is my brother, indeed it is." Shadow yawned and stretched.
"Well, how's your progress with the Rasengan?" He inquired.</P><P>"Well,
I've mastered it, but I'm trying to make it a lot bigger for more
damage. We've both already mastered it and the Rasengan Dangan,
(saw this before, not mine.), and we mastered every E through A rank
scroll in our house. All that's left is S-class, and that'll take
a long time. Also, did you sign the two summoning contracts like me?"</P><P>"Yes,
I have. I have demonic snakes, demonic wolves. You have demonic
foxes, demonic falcons. Also, because of our Kage Bunshin training,
with our high chakra, we're already the level of mid Jounin. That's
about twenty years of training."</P><P>Naruto
nodded his head and went outside and jumped onto the roof to look at
the village. 'Father, Mother, although you love the village, me and
Shadow don't, but, we will always protect, no matter what. We're
looked upon as demons, nothing more. This village disgraces you both.
We are sorry mother, father.'</P><P>"<B>Well,
just remember Naru-kun, Shadow, Sarutobi, Tsuki, Sarios, Aoikaen, and
I are always with you. No matter what." She said gently.</B></P><P>Over
the years, the three boys had gotten very close with their demons.
They had already decided when they were older that they would marry.
After all, they were immortal, and had eternal life. Shadow and Tsuki
had found a way to let her out of the seal by summoning her in human
form. Tonight, Naruto, Hitomi, Sarios and Aoikaen had planned to try
the summoning to see if it will work as well.</P><P>-------------------Outside,
in a deep forest--------------------</P><P>"Alright,
let's see if this works guys." Shadow said watching with Tsuki on
his arm.</P><P>He
nodded his head and did the hand seals, and yelled out "Summoning
Jutsu: Kyuubi No Kitsune!" A puff of smoke covered the clearing and
a humanoid figure was in the cloud and suddenly latched itself onto
Naruto.</P><P>"Yay!
It worked! Now I can be with Naruto-kun whenever he lets me out!"
The voice was definitely feminine, which they assumed was Kyuubi.
Once the smoke cleared, they saw Naruto holding Hitomi's arm and
smiled to his brother.</P><P>Next
it was Sarios and Aoikaen's turn "Summoning Jutsu: Shichibi No
Ryu</P><P>"Success."
Was all that was needed to be said. Hitomi and Tsuki ran towards each
other and hugged one another while Sarios and Aoikaen hugged.</P><P>"It's
so good to be able to be out here again!" Hitomi said as she
flipped her hair and smiled. Tsuki and Aoikaen nodded.</P><P>"Indeed.
Now we can be with them forever. And I mean forever." Tsuki said.</P><P>They
looked over at the three boys and smiled at them. They smiled back,
and went to their respective woman. They walked home and had a
delicious supper. After that, they went to bed and slept peacefully.</P><P>----------------Next
Morning, Day Of Graduation---------------</P><P>Today
was the day they would graduate. Naruto, Sarios, and Shadow woke up
to find their own beds empty, but felt the presence of their demons
in their minds, knowing they were sleeping.</P><P>They
got up and had breakfast. Naruto and Shadow got dressed in red and
black battle uniforms and Sarios got dress in a green and blue battle
uniform. They left their house and use the Shunshin No Jutsu to
teleport to the school and be the first ones there.</P><P>A
couple house later, class had started and they were waiting for their
names. Soon, their names were called and they went our side.</P><P>"Today,"
said Iruka, "In order to pass, you must use three of your own Jutsu
to past."</P><P>The
class just nodded and everyone went, using the basic three to past
with an average, except for Sasuke, who ended with Katon: Ryuka No
Jutsu, earning the 'Rookie of the Year' award.</P><P>Only
three were left and they were Naruto, Sarios, and Shadow. Shadow
decided to go first among the three.</P><P>He
walked up and heard people snickering behind and knew that they
wanted him to fail. He just sighed and made hand seals faster than
anyone could keep up with. His first one would be white hot.</P><P>"Katon:
Karyū Endan!" An extremely hot line of flame shot from his mouth
and went about 10 meters.</P><P>The
crowd could only gape. Sasuke was bristling with anger. People were
changing their view of Shadow quickly.</P><P>"Kuchiyose
no Jutsu!" A large snake about the size Manda, although much
stronger, appeared with Shadow on his head.</P><P>"<B>Why
did you summon me?"</B> The
snake asked.</P><P>"Because
I want to pass. Besides, good shows gives us better credit. Anyways
you can go." The snake disappeared.</P><P>He
held his hand out and a blue ball of energy gathered in it, making a
typhoon sound. Iruka couldn't form a sentence.</P><P>"How….
When… where…" The kids looked at their teacher to see what was
wrong with him. They looked back at Shadow as he threw the ball,
having destroy a fair amount of land.</P><P>"Rasengan
Dangan." (Spiral Bullet) Was all he said.</P><P>"I
take it I pass Sensei?" Shadow asked.</P><P>Iruka
could only nod his head and hand him a headband, which Shadow took
and tied around his left arm, then inside and waited for his brother.</P><P>Naruto
stepped up, knowing it was his turn.</P><P>He
made a single seal and held his hand out.</P><P>"Fūton:
Daitoppa!" A large blast of wind blew threw the area and destroyed
a large area.</P><P>"Raikyu!"
A ball of lighting appeared from nowhere and blew a nice hole in the
ground.</P><P>Naruto
held both his hands summoning a lot of chakra to each hand. In his
right hand, was a blue sphere, which the class realized as the
Rasengan, but his left hand, which held red chakra, in the same
sphere, they didn't know.</P><P>Naruto
then slammed them both into a tree "Rasengan Nirentotsu!"</P><P>The
class could only look at the destruction and realized, that whatever
was said about him, was exactly opposite of him.</P><P>Naruto
walked up and took a headband and tired it around his right arm. He
went inside and sat next to Shadow.</P><P>Then
Sarios came up and decided to use three of his personal jutsus and he
started with "Dragon style: Eye Beam" which was like the Rasengan
but it had a green center and blue around it giving it the look of an
eye and without hesitation he aimed at a tree and fired a green beam
of chakra blowing a hole in everything it hit up to 30 meters away.
Then like Shadow he did "Summoning Jutsu" and summoned a giant
green dragon around the size of Shadow's snake. Then he did one of
his favorite jutsus "Dragon style: Dragon's World" which is his
most powerful genjutsu and he can target specific enemies to use it
on, so he targeted Mizuki and Iruka and when he was done they passed
him and he picked up a headband and tied it to his left leg then
walked off to join Shadow and Naruto.</P><P>---------------A
couple hours later-------------------</P><P>"Alright
class! I want to congratulate you for a job well done. From here on,
you're all Shinobi of Konoha. Make me proud. Your sensei's will
be here shortly. Now, let's introduce the teams."</P><P>"Team
Seven," People picked their heads up at this. "Uzumaki Naruto,
Uzumaki Shadow," A loud W00T! Was heard. He continued "And
Kordaka Sarios. Sensei is Yuuhi Kurenai." Many shrieks of
displeasure were heard.</P><P>"Team
Eight Yamanaka Ino, Akimichi Choji, and Nara Shikamaru. Sensei is
Sarutobi Asuma." Another groan was heard from Ino.</P><P>"Team
Ten. Hyuuga Hinata, Inuzuka Kiba, and Aburame Shino. Sensei is
Hayate."</P><P>Uchiha
Sasuke you are the apprentice to Hatake Kakashi.</P><P>Soon
the senseis began to arrive. First was a red eyed woman.</P><P>"Alright,
Team Seven with me." And the three walked with her. They walked out
and followed her to a training field.</P><P>"Alright.
Let's start with introductions. You, the darker haired blonde."</P><P>Shadow
opened his eyes and yawned.</P><P>"My
name is Uzumaki Shadow. I like training, learning more jutsu, my
brother, and cooking. I dislike people who are stuck up, and judge
people before they get to know them."</P><P>Kurenai
just nodded and pointed to Naruto "You go."</P><P>"My
name is Uzumaki Naruto. What my brother said, is what I like and
dislike. Nothing much more needed to be said."</P><P>She
nodded again. She pointed at Sarios "Go."</P><P>"My
name is Kordaka Sarios. My likes are the color green, dragons, the
Uzumaki brothers and kind people. My dislikes are dragon hunters,
cruel people. My dream is something personal that I won't say
unless I trust you completely."</P><P>Kurenai
nodded again. She then smiled lightly at her team "Alright guys,
tomorrow we will be having a survival test to see if you're good
enough to become Genin."</P><P>"What!?"
Was shouted by all three of them. If they failed, what would happen?
Well, let's find out.</P><p align='center'>"This
test has a 66.6 chance of failure. So, you best be prepared for it.
Also, do not eat breakfast, because you'll throw up." She then
left after that. Naruto, Sarios and Shadow also walked home.</P><p align='center'>As
they were walking Sarios said "Well technically we did graduate so
you get to see my bloodline scroll so we may as well stop by the
Kordaka compound so you can see it.". "Alright finally we get to
see what your kekai genkai (sp?) does" Naruto said as they walked
towards the Kordaka Compound. A few minutes later they were walking
into the jutsu library "Ok let me do this because it takes the
blood of a Kordaka to get to the scroll" Sarios said as he walked
up to the south wall an with a kunai traced his blood on a certain
spot on it then an audible "Poof" was heard as the scroll
appeared "Ok you guys can see this scroll ONLY if you swear that it
will never be known to anyone I didn't already tell" "OK" the
brothers promised. Sarios then opened the scroll and on it was a
description of the Ryuugan and its abilities.</P><p align='center'><I>The
Ryuugan was gifted to us the Kordaka clan hundreds of years ago by
the Dragon king whose name we no longer remember but it's
appearance is neon emerald green with a blue diamond shaped tomoe for
each level. There are only 6 Levels and the 6</I><I>th</I><I>
one only comes to one who nearly gives their life for another's and
lives only 5 people have ever gotten it. It is also know as the Reiga
Ryuugan or dragon soul eye</I></P><p align='center'><I>Level
1: 1 blue diamond tomoe and the power to see chakra allowing one to
send chakra to certain points much like the byakugan but more
powerful as it matures and amplifies the users chakra control whether
the Ryuugan is activated or not</I></P><p align='center'><I>Level
2: 2 blue tomoes and the ability to copy another moves just by seeing
them including kekke genkai, one handed seals, two handed seals and a
few no seal jutsus.</I></P><p align='center'><I>Level
3: 3 blue tomoes and the ability to move extremely fast for long
periods making it look like you can teleport which is very useful for
confusing enemies.</I></P><p align='center'><I>Level
4:4 blue tomoes and the ability to sense the future when a friend or
loved one is involved. This is a very strange stage of the Ryuugan
because the user can't sense their own future only the future of a
friend or loved one and only sense if it will be good or bad.</I></P><p align='center'><I>Level
5: 5 blue tomoes and the ability to summon weapons from ones mind
even ones that don't exist but it takes a lot of chakra so it is
not used regularly this is also a strange stage of the Ryuugan.</I></P><p align='center'><I>Level
6: 6 blue tomoes also know as the Reiga Ryuugan it lets you use
special genjutsu and ninjutsu that are extremely powerful but takes
loads of chakra and even more hard work to master the jutsu names are
Kardorkari (genjutsu) and Eternal dragon flame (ninjutsu).</I></P><p align='center'>"Damn
you got one hell of a kekke genkai Sarios" Naruto whistled "I
know Naruto its abilities come in handy when I want to learn
something new. Well I'm gonna go to sleep cause I got a feeling it
will be a long day tomorrow you are welcome to stay if you want"
"I'm in" Naruto said "Same here" Shadow said. And with
those words the all went to their room s and promptly fell asleep.</P><p align='center'>Ok
that last part took a while couldn't decide what to give the
Ryuugan and tell me if I spelt anything wrong like the word for soul
I think I got that wrong tell me and ill fix it. NOTE flamers I will
kill u with a spoon if u flame me so NO FLAMING OR ELSE!!!!!!</P><p align='center'>Ps
srry for the lines I kinda made a mistake and can't delete it =.=

chapter in my story R&R no flames or u can be an ass and flame me
but I will either ignore it or flame u back twice as bad so flame me
at your on risk I thrive on fire MUAHAHAHAHAA I don't own Naruto or
shadow just Sarios, Aoikaen and all my dragon jutsus</B></P><P>"<B>Kit its time to
wake up…KIT!!!!! Wake your ass up NOW!"</B> with that Naruto
jumped up after Hitomi mentally yelled at him "I'm up I'm up
geez Hitomi-Chan no need to yell that loud<B> "I have been yelling
at you for 2 HOURS and I got pissed so I used chakra to enhance my
voice so you would wake up now go get breakfast so you I don't have
to listen to you whine during training about being hungry"</B> "But
Kurenai-sensei said to not eat or we'll puke" Naruto said Hitomi
sighed and replied <B>"did it ever occur to you that she wants you
to be weak so you can't think straight or fight well"</B>
Naruto's eyes widened as he began to understand his sensei's
plot. "Oh I get it now she wants to disorient us so we can be
picked off one by one" Naruto said "I bet the others already
figured it out too well I'm going to get a light breakfast so I
have energy to fight" <B>Tsuki and Aoikaen have already figured it
out along with Shadow and Sarios so now we just have to see what kind
of test it is" </B>Hitomi informed him "Well knowing the village
it is probably the old bell test or capture our sensei for so long or
something like that" Naruto said with a yawn "I'm hungry lets
go get breakfast" and with that Naruto headed to the kitchen where
he smelled food and s he arrived Lupal and just finished breakfast
for all three of them so they happily ate their light breakfast
before heading to the training field. Within a few minutes of
arriving Kurenai appeared and said "Ok the object of this test is
to get a bell from me the one who fails gets sent back to the
academy" with a smirk. All three boys yawned causing Kurenai to
sweat drop "Well aren't you gonna panic and wonder who gets
thrown out???" "Are you kidding us cmon we did our homework we
know this is a test on teamwork and we know how to pass and we also
know you have 3 bells but one is under genjutsu" Sarios said with a
grin while Naruto and Shadow just chuckled quietly to themselves.
"Damn you kids are good but now you have to get the bells and you
have until noon now…Begin!" with that Kurenai disappeared. Sarios
grinned again and said "Ok this will be fun shall we lets the girls
have a bit out for some fresh air?" Shadow said "Why not they'll
enjoy it. Summoning Jutsu: Hachibi no Ookami!" "Summoning Jutsu:
Kyuubi no Kitsune!" Naruto yelled "Summoning Jutsu: Shichibi no
Ryuu" Sarios yelled and with a loud POOF the three bijuus popped
out and stretched their legs and smiled "So we get to have some fun
ne?" Aoikaen asked "Yes but don't cripple or kill just keep her
busy got it?" Shadow said Hitomi sighed and said "Alright but the
next real fight against enemies we better get to kill some" "Deal"
Sarios said "Now go keep her busy" Hitomi grinned "Cmon girls
lets have some fun" she said right before the three demons
shushined to the clearing Kurenai was in "Come out little ninja we
know you are here" Tsuki growled as they showed their demonic
features "what is the little kunoichi (sp?) afraid to play we are
just 3 lonely demons summoned by your students". Aoikaen playfully
said then ducked as a kunai came from a tree Kurenai appeared with a
glint in her eye "so the bijuus are female well I'm not surprised
females have more common sense may I know your names and rank before
I fight you?" Kurenai politely asked. "Yes I am Hitomi the Kyuubi
no Kitsune this is my best friend Tsuki the Hachibi no Ookami and the
green one is Aoikaen the Shichibi no Ryuu" Kurenai's jaw dropped
at the three demons before her "T-t-the Kyuubi!!! You aren't
going to destroy me or my students or the village are you?" "Nope
we don't want to kill you or the villagers except those that
mistreat your students and as for me I'm just after Orochimaru
(sp?) because he tried to control me and it failed so I went into a
rage and followed his scent which lead me to your village you know
the rest. So I'm not out for revenge the only humans I care about
are Naruto, Shadow, and Sarios" Hitomi explained. "Ok I
understand gomen <B>(this means sorry right?)</B>. Now why are you
here and what is your plan?" Kurenai asked "We're going to
fight you but worry not for we have been forbidden to kill or
seriously injure you so you lucked out" Aoikaen said with a slight
pout. Hitomi started doing hand signs and then "Katon: Karyu Endan"
and blew a long strand of flame at Kurenai who dodged all of the
fire, dragon and wind attacks being thrown at her. Aoikaen grinned
and did some hand signs "Dragon style: Dragon Laser" then formed
what looked like a green Rasengan but she pointed it at Kurenai and
fired a beam of pure chakra missing her by a hair but succeeding in
scaring the shit out of her and made her jump right into Tsuki's
trap with was chakra enhanced making it impossible for her to get
away while the bells were taken from her by Sarios, Naruto, and
Shadow. "Looks like we pass Kurenai-sensei" Shadow said with a
smirk "When's our first mission?" Kurenai sighed at having been
beat so quickly by mere kids and said" tomorrow morning, meet me
here and we will begin your missions"</P><P>----------------------------------------------time
skip-------------------------------</P><P>(3 days later)</P><P>"GOD DAMNIT STOP
GIVING US SHITTY MISSIONS JII-SAN (sp?) WE NEED A REAL MISSION NOT
THIS BULLSHIT!!!!!" yelled Naruto while his team and sensei just
sweat dropped, the Hokage opened his mouth to answer Naruto but a
council member standing next to him said "Quiet you little demon,
you should be glad we let you become a ninja at all so you WILL
respect the Hokage and council and you WILL not complain or you WILL
be killed" the council member said with a smirk Naruto, Shadow,
Sarios and the Hokage just glared at him until WHAM Kurenai decked
him in the face and knocked him out of the tower, she then yelled
"DON"T YOU DARE CALL ANY OF THEM DEMONS OR I'LL KICK YOUR ASS
ALL THE WAY TO SUNA!" <I>"Damn she is hot when she is mad"</I>
Shadow thought while everyone else just stared in awe and shock until
Sarutobi coughed breaking the tension and said "Well… it just so
happens that we have a C ranked mission to the waves you can have if
you want all you have to do is protect that guy and make sure he
finishes building his bridge" he said while pointing at a drunk old
man who had just walked in and then the guy said "Wha ares yoush
kiddin me dees ar mah bodygurds they all looks like retards specilly
the one with black hair and green tips he loks stuuuupid but the
pretty lady cans come alng" he slurred while eyeing Kurenai who
replied with a cold stare while Sarios fumed "If you try ANYTHING
pervert I'll saw of you balls with a spoon" she threatened
causing the drunk guy to quickly banish all perverted thoughts and
Shadow to once again think about how hot she was. Sarutobi coughed
again and said "Ok Tazuna if you have finished hitting on Kurenai
and insulting out 3 best genin you may get started on your way in 2
hours that way you have till noon to get packed and head out. Oh
before I forget Naruto, you, Shadow and Sarios are to attend a

<br><br><h3>Chapter 6</h3><hr><br><P><B>HELLLLLOOOO NARUTO FANS I'm back and I couldn't resist ending
there but now that I have some OC's that aren't mine this chapter
is READY to roll R & R cause you love me other wise why would you
be reading this.</B></P><P>"Hey Seika wait up
there is no rush to get to wave we are already a day early so lets
rest a bit" Riku Atmael said to his twin sister Seika Atmael <B>(last
name is pronounced AT MAY EL just so you know and Seika is pronounced
SAI KUH)</B> "Riku you know I hate staying in one spot besides
Zabuza said he had found us a place to stay and he has an employer"
Seika scolded "Yeah well don't forget the saying haste makes
waste now sit and rest for 5 minutes with me" Riku said before
turning into a panther with black fur and lounging in the shade of a
nearby tree. "Fine 5 minutes" Seika said with a huff before
becoming a panther with a pure white coat and lying down next to Riku
and within a few minutes the two half-demons had fallen asleep</P><P>-------Meanwhile------</P><P>"Cmon where is that
drunk bastard Tazuna I'll kill him if he isn't here in 5 minutes"
Shadow growled. Just then Tazuna walked up and asked "Am I late?"
"No you made it 3 minutes early now we can get going" Sarios said
as they started towards wave</P><P>(30 minutes later)</P><P>They were walking when
Sarios, Shadow, Naruto, and Kurenai noticed a puddle of water <I>"Wow
are they really THAT stupid?" </I>Shadow thought while Sarios just
silently shook with mirth and Naruto and Kurenai had the same thought
as Shadow but all four Shinobi decided to wait for the enemy to make
the first move. Within a couple of minutes the enemy ninjas struck
slicing Kurenai in half causing Tazuna to gasp and the genin to smirk
which irritated one of the claw wielding ninjas "What are you
smirking about we are about to kill you!" causing Sarios to start
laughing again but out loud this time which really pissed off both
ninja who attacked the genin only to find out they were shadow
clones. To the mist ninjas embarrassment their target had escaped
while they were threatening the clones and they started to head
towards the clearing where Zabuza said they were to meet up with 2
ninjas and escort them to his hideout "Damn it brother we screwed
up" "We sure did… oh well lets jest go escort those two ninjas
Zabuza told us about to the hideout" and with that the two mist
ninjas arrived in the clearing and waited for Riku and Seika. <I><B>"HEY
KID WAKE UP!!!!"</B></I> Rend who was a 10 tailed demon as was his
mate <B>(two 10 tailed demons 1 male 1 female and their mates{don't
give me any BS about having two 10 tailed demons it is my fic so I
make the rules})</B> who was sealed in Seika, yelled at Riku causing
him to jump up yelling "I'm up, I'm up!" and he quickly woke
Seika who yelled at him for letting them fall asleep "YOU DUMBASS
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO KEEP ME AWAKE NOT LET ME FALL ASLEEP WE WIL BE
LATE NOW" <I><B>"Temper, temper little one don't let everyone
from here to suna know where we are after all not even Kyuubi knows
of us and we would like it kept that way"</B></I> Celestial warned
<I>"Well if Riku wasn't so damn thickheaded I wouldn't be so
loud" </I><I><B>"…true well just keep it down till we get to
Zabuza's hideout"</B></I><I> "Fine but only cause I respect
you."</I> "Alright Riku lets just go we have to meet with Gaiza
and Taiza <B>(I don't know their real names and I don't really
care so here their names are Gaiza and Taiza)</B> so we can get to
Zabuza" Seika said "Alrighty then lets go!" Riku said before
bounding off to the clearing. Riku and Seika due to being superior
ninjas got to the clearing before Gaiza and Taiza and sat down only
to jump to their feet seconds later as Gaiza and Taiza arrived and
said "I'm guessing Zabuza sent you to escort us to him" Riku
stated "Yes now follow us and we will take you to him" Gaiza said
'Very well lead the way" Seika replied</P><P>------Time skip-----1
hour</P><P>"Hey Zabuza your
guests have arrived" Gaiza shouted "Alright I'm coming"
Zabuza answered from the next room. Within a minute Zabuza walked in
and hugged both Riku and Seika shocking Gaiza and Taiza for they had
never seen the nice fatherly side of him. "Well have you two grown
bet you might be a challenge now, well Haku is cleaning up she'll
be done soon I hope. She has been dieing to see you again Riku"
Zabuza said with a slightly perverted grin. Riku blushed and Seika
rolled her eyes "Same old Zabuza. Have you killed the Mizukage
yet?" Seika asked "No but the group of ninjas Gaiza and Taiza
encountered earlier outsmarted them completely so I want to send you
to negotiate with them after of course we kill the man their guarding
since I'm being paid well for that" Zabuza explained "now lets
hit the hay you two must be tired and I know I am <B>(I really didn't
want to write this mission but it was important so I got no choice
but I'm skipping the first battle and the tree training thing)</B></P><P><B>----</B>Time
skip---- after the fight with Zabuza</P><P>"Hey Naruto lets go
help Tazuna build the bridge with our shadow clones that way we can
leave even sooner" Sarios "Great idea Sarios lets go!" Naruto
said "Wait Naruto, Sarios Tsuki wants out and I bet Hitomi and
Aoikaen want out as well so let's give them some freedom" Shadow
proposed "OK why not" Naruto and Sarios said before summoning
their demons. "Aahhhhh feels good to be able to smell the fresh air
again" Aoikaen exclaimed before becoming a small green dragon just
the right size for perching on Sarios left shoulder while Hitomi
turned into a small red fox and curled up around Naruto's neck and
Tsuki turned into a wolf puppy and sat on Shadows head. Kurenai felt
a little jealousy towards Tsuki for being that close to Shadow but
she shook her heard clearing it of those thoughts <I>"damn it
Kurenai don't become what you hate!!"</I> she thought as she
watched the genin head towards the bridge before sighing and
following them to keep watch for Zabuza. When they arrived Sarios,
Naruto, and Shadow yelled out "Shadow Clone Jutsu" and made 50
clones each before walking up to Tazuna and asking "Ok what can we
do?" "Uuuuuuhhhhh…Oh I know hammer the boards in place so my
men can lay down the steel and concrete faster." Tazuna ordered
"Yes sir" the clones replied and got to work. They took a break
at noon to rest and in the middle of lunch a heavy mist rolled in
causing Kurenai to frown in worry.<I> "Mist isn't hat heavy
unless it has a HELL of a lot of moisture in it or its condensed
chakra in the form of mist like what Zabuza…uses…SHIT HE IS
BACK!!!!"</I> "SHADOW, SARIOS, NARUTO DEFENCIVE POSITIONS ZABUZA
IS BACK" she then heard a whirling sound and ducked knowing what it
was only to have it fly past her towards Tazuna "I don't think so
Zabuza" Aoikaen said as she grabbed the blade right before it hit
Tazuna and slammed it into the ground "You want your sword then
come and get it" she challenged as Hitomi and Tsuki joined her and
got into their respective fighting stances. Then the words "Die
Bitch!!!" were heard as a enemy ninja slammed Aoikaen threw the
heart with his claw causing her to be sent back into Sarios who
summoned her back out. They exchanged a look Aoikaen nodded and they
said in unison "Futon(sp?): Dual Whirlwinds" and swept away the
mist exposing Riku, Seika, Gaiza, Taiza, Haku, and Zabuza who had his
real sword on his back since the one he threw was a shadow clone of
it. "So we have 3 jinchuuriki (sp?) to fight should be fun" Riku
said with a grin "To bad we can't kill you guys" "Oh and why
not?" Shadow asked "Because we need your help to over throw the
Mizukage he has become lazy, fat, and corrupt. So after Tazuna is
dead we will hire you guys and then the land of mist will get a
better Mizukage." Seika explained. "And what makes you think
we'll except your job offer" Kurenai said Riku shrugged and said
"If you refuse we'll kill you" Shadow coughed and said "I
have a compromise lets us finish our mission and we'll help you
because if your working for Gato (sp?) then he'll stab in the back
as soon as you kill Tazuna. Soooo it is much easier if we kill Gato
then you raid his mansion for all his goods, money, and whatever else
you want. Do we have a deal?"</P><P>Zabuza
was speechless because he couldn't believe how good the deal was so
he nodded and shook hands with Shadow "Hey Shadow, Gato is coming
and you were right he meant to backstab Zabuza" Gaiza announced
"Gato is mine because he tried to use us and his goons tried to
rape me and failed HORRIBLY" Haku stated sadistic smirk "Fine but
let our "tenants" have some fun first with the thugs" Naruto
said "Hey girls go wild" Sarios simply stated causing all three
demons to grin and ready themselves to spring once they had used
genjutsu to hide themselves from Gato's men as they prepared their
ambush. 3 minutes later Gato arrived, look around and said "well,
well Zabuza here I was thinking I could reward you for killing Tazuna
by killing you but you can't even kill a defenseless bridge builder
I guess you aren't so great after all" trying to rile Zabuza up
so he would do something stupid and die (keyword TRYING) the only
thing Gato accomplished was signing an even more painful death
warrant from Haku who was ready to castrate, dismember, and skin him
alive and then freeze him solid only to smash him into tiny little
pieces. But she patiently waited for Hitomi, Tsuki, and Aoikaen to
annihilate Gato's henchmen she didn't have to wait long because
half of Gato's men die in less than a second thanks to a
combination of Aoikaen's Dragon Laser and Tsuki's Lightning Wolfe
jutsus leaving Hitomi to start rending and slashing at the thugs
while Aoikaen and Tsuki hit them from long range within 3 seconds all
of the thugs were dead and only Gato was left looking horrified the
three FEMALES (he didn't know they were demons) had decimated his
forces that fast only to see that Haku was walking up to him with a
sadistic grin on her face and could only try to run away in horror
and didn't get very far when a senbon hit both of his legs knocking
him down. He rolled over only to see Haku with a very big, serrated
and over all evil looking knife with a grin she started to kill him
SLOWLY (A/N I won't write it cause I scare myself with these
thoughts I even had nightmares) 1 hour later Gato was dead and Tazuna
was having day-mares about what he say Gaiza and Taiza were
horrified, Shadow, Naruto, and Sarios were slightly disturbed, the
demonesses (sp?) couldn't care less, Zabuza was proud of Haku
because he saw himself as her father, Riku was pale faced and Seika
was also disturbed, and Kurenai was throwing up. "Well that is
that" Haku said as she walked back to the group "Now lets start
packing for our assault against the Mizukage" Zabuza ordered.
Sarios yawned and said "We carry our belongings with us at all
times thanks to the seals we made" "Ok so now we just kill the
Mizukage" Zabuza said</P><P>-----Time
skip-----</P><P>(What I
am lazy)</P><P>2 days
later (Ok ok I am very lazy)</P><P>"Hooray
the Mizukage is dead… … …Who will be our new one?" random
citizen971 shouted (weird name huh) 'I say Zabuza Momochi" "I
agree" "Me to" and so Zabuza Momochi became the Mizukage and
set about making the village better and he sent a peace accord to the
Sandiame (sp?) Hokage asking for peace and to thank him for sending
the ninja team to wave. Zabuza also sent Haku to live with Riku
saying "she has made me proud there is nothing more I can do for
her, protect her Riku or ill make what Haku did to Gato look tame"
which of course caused Riku to almost have a heart attack and Seika
decided to move to Konoha and Riku (of course) agreed. And with that
the wave mission ended and Sarios, Naruto, Shadow, Kurenai, Riku,
Seika, and Haku all headed to Konoha.</P><P><B>Yay I
finished chapter 5 I feel so proud now to work on chapter 6 *sigh*
well R & R or I'll send Haku after you. As I have said before
if you have a character you want in give the info to me before
chapter 7 cause by then ill have planed out most of my fic now give
me the info in the review. Till next time Bio Wolfe out</B></P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 7</h3><hr><br><P><B>Yo I had some writer's block and I forgot what I was gonna write
next more than once so I went back and reread some of the manga to
remember what happened next…also I got sick which sucked but I got
over it quickly and…a few "other" things happened which won't
be mentioned which are still causing me pain…and I got some helpful
reviews from some readers on how my paragraphs are cramped and I
don't separate them and I'm gonna fix that starting with this
chapter (Note: they are still gonna be long paragraphs so if I make a
mistake just tell me and I'll fix it) AND Ryuu doesn't mean
dragon as I thought it did but Doragon does but the Ryuugan stays as
Ryuugan and it's meaning is the same as well now have a awesome
day!</B></P><P>The day
after Team 7 got back from wave Naruto, Shadow, and Sarios were led
to the council room for a meeting by some Anbu black Ops. A few
minutes later they were standing in the council chamber with the
Hokage and all of the civilian and clan heads present. Naruto asked
"Hokage-sama why are we here?" "Silence you bloodthirsty demon
you have no right to speak here unless you are spoken to!!" a
random civilian council member shouted at Naruto thinking that the
Hokage would praise him for treating the demon-children like this <B>(OH
BOY are they fucking retarded or what?)</B> and Hitomi, Tsuki, and
Aoikaen lost it and summoned themselves out of their respective
hosts. <B>"YOU DARE TO TALK LIKE THAT TO THE BOY WHO KEPT YOU FROM
DIEING A HORRIBLE DEATH FOR MANY YEARS!!!!!"</B> Hitomi ranted in
all her demonic glory while Tsuki and Aoikaen just glared and cracked
their knuckles causing the ENTIRE civilian side of the council to
freak out "AHHHH THE DEMONS ARE LOOSE!!!!WE'RE ALL GONNA
DIE!!!!!!!!" is what must of them were screaming while Hiashi (sp?)
Hyuuga was calm and collected since he saw past the demon since the
beginning and knew Naruto and Shadow were just kids and she wasn't
concentrating chakra so he wasn't worried. But he was thinking of
how much Hinata blushes when Naruto is brought up or around her and
he started to connect the dots so to speak. So he decided to have a
talk with her and see how she really felt. "EHEM!" he coughed
loudly getting everyone's attention and looked at the council
member's and said "Shut the fuck up you retarded shitheads I mean
you really thought Naruto and Shadow were actual demons? How fucking
stupid can you get…this is why they most likely hate this village
because of retards like you" Tsume was laughing her ass off at the
civilian members, The Nara clan head<B> (I forget his name does
anyone know it? And ino's dad and choji's dad.)</B> was sleeping,
Ino's dad was planning how to make his garden better, and Choji's
dad was eating chips, and the Hokage was thinking <I>"I wonder what
Jiraiya (sp?) is writing right now…I wonder when the next Icha Icha
book will come out…"</I> Shadow spoke up "Yeah we do hate this
village because of what was done to us BUT we only stay here and
spare the village because mom and dad loved this village and gave
their lives to save it by sealing the demons in us" the civilians
gasped at this and one of them said "you two are the Yondaime's
children? Then we must enact the…" "NO YOU WON'T ENACT YOUR
STUPID CLAN BREEDING SHIT AND IF YOU TRY IT WE WILL LEAVE THIS STUPID
VILLAGE!" Shadow yelled at them in an incredibly angry voice "If
my brother leaves so do I" Naruto said "If the Namikaze's leave
then so do the Kordaka's" Sarios said with a slight smile "And
do you idiots really think you can stop THREE Jinchuurikis? Because
if so then bring it and we can let the Kyuubi, the Hachibi, and the
Shichibi loose on the village" Sarios taunted the council causing
the civilians to pale and wonder why this was happening to them.
Hiashi spoke up "ehem I Hiashi Hyuuga would like to offer a treaty
so to speak where if you ever need help with anything you can call on
the Hyuuga clan since we never tried to help you or hurt you in the
past. Please consider this as atonement for our inactions in the
past" then Tsume spoke up "I also wish to have a clan pact with
both the Kordaka's and the Namikaze's stating that we the Inuzukas
can help either clan without repercussions from anyone even the
Hokage since we have helped Naruto and Shadow in the past in secret
now we wish to be open about it…if you agree of course" she told
Naruto, Shadow and Sarios. The three Genin whispered amongst
themselves for a minute and all three nodded "We accept the clan
pacts as long as there are no hidden clauses or anything like that
they must be straightforward and honest" Shadow spoke for the
group. "Very well we shall have the pacts written up soon enough"
Hiashi said. "Well if this is all we will be leaving now to rest
from our mission now good day" Sarios said before they shushined to
their respective homes for the rest of the day.</P><P>(THE NEXT
DAY)</P><P>At
training ground 7 Naruto, Shadow and Sarios were waiting for Kurenai
like always but for once she was late and Shadow was getting a little
worried and was hoping she wasn't sick or anything thing when she
shushined (SP?) into the clearing and announced "I have nominated
you for the chuunin exams I hope you blow away the competition…if
you choose to go that is" She told the genins "What do you mean
if we choose to sensei…of course we gonna go this is what we
trained so hard for right guys?" Naruto said "Kurenai-sensei if
you think we would say no lets wait till next time then your crazier
than we are" Sarios said "I agree with Sarios. Why would we not
want to go?" Shadow stated. Kurenai smiled "I figured you'd say
that so I brought these" She gave them each a form" These are the
chuunin exam applications just fill them out and go to room 301
tomorrow and I'll tell you a little secret…Zabuza sent a genin
team to participate in the exam so don't underestimate them…I
would befriend them if I were you" "Zabuza already sent a team?
Wow they must be good…I wanna meet them and hopefully befriend
them" Naruto said while Sarios and Shadow just nodded "Oh and one
more little secret…Riku, Seika, and Haku were all made Jounins
because of their skill levels so don't be surprised if you don't
see them during the exams and make sure you get to the academy on
time" "Kurenai-sensei you know we're never late" Sarios
reminded her "Now lets go home and rest up for the exams tomorrow"
Shadow said before heading to the Namikaze estate with Naruto
following him. "Well I'll see ya later Kurenai-sensei, I'm
gonna head home to eat and rest up for tomorrow" Sarios informed
her before he left for his house.</P><P>The next
morning Sarios woke up feeling strange but just blamed being nervous
about the exams and headed downstairs to eat some breakfast with his
mom and once she had finish cooking pancakes and turned around to
serve them her jaw dropped and she dropped the food as she stared at
her son "S...s...son look behind you" she stuttered out and
pointed at what she was staring at. Sarios looked behind him and his
jaw dropped at what he saw as well, he had a white dragon tail."<I>AOIKAEN!!!!!</I>" Sarios mentally shouted at the demoness
in his mind causing her to wake up from her sleep and ask</P><P>"<I>Yes
Sarios-kun?</I>" which made Sarios blush slightly at the Kun suffix
but he quickly calmed himself and asked rather bluntly "<I>why do I
have a dragon tail coming out of my ass?</I>" Aoikaen looked
confused "<I>Huh?</I>" "<I>Here I'll just summon you out and
show you</I>" "Summoning Jutsu: Shichibi no Doragon!" and
Aoikaen appeared in a puff of smoke "Ok now what do you mean you
have a tail?" Aoikaen asked, Sarios just turned around and showed
her his new white dragon tail causing her to gasp at what might be
happening "Oh…Shit… great just what we both needed more
complications…Sarios do you why you have a tail?" Aoikaen asked.</P><P>"No"
he simply stated "Damn…well to be frank you're now a hanyou
(sp?) a half-demon because of you having used so much of my chakra
and the fact that your body has absorbed a lot of it too means it
turned you into a half-demon sometime last night…which makes me
think if Naruto and Shadow are in the same predicament as us right
now…we'll know later at the academy" Aoikaen explained to
Sarios who had a strange look on his face when he learned about the
half-demon part "Hmm… so I'm half demon now…does that mean I
can shape shift into a dragon now?" Sarios asked. "Yes but not a
very large on and you will be immortal in the sense that you won't
age past 30 and you can't die from old age" Aoikaen told him
before looking at the clock "Damn if we don't leave now we'll
be late now hurry get some clothes on quick and we'll have to run
like hell to make it on time" She told him quickly. Sarios nodded
and dressed quickly and made sure his weapon seals were still there
and occupied "Alright lets go Aoi-chan" he said to see her
reaction and was pleased that she blushed furiously.</P><P>About 20
minutes later they arrived at the academy just in time and stood next
to Naruto, Shadow, Hitomi, and Tsuki and saw that both Naruto and
Shadow both had a demonic tail each "Hey Naruto, hey Shadow… you
got tails too?" "Yup" they both said as one. "Sweet cause I
didn't want to be the only one to get a demon tail, now let's go
kick some ass in this exam" The others nod and they head into the
academy. They climb up some stairs and see room 301 and smile when
they see all the people crowded around it. They walk up to the door
and look at it "Huh this is a pathetic genjutsu…and those of you
who didn't notice are even more pathetic…Kai" Shadow said
dispelling the genjutsu showing it was really room 201 and walked
away towards the stairs headed for the real room 301.</P><P>A few
minutes later they had just walked into the Exam room and saw that
Kiba, Hinata, Shino, Shikamaru, Ino, Choji, Rock lee, Neji, and Ten
Ten had all made it to the exams and Kiba had just shouted out "You
losers better watch out cause I'm the top dog here! Prepare to
lose!" which needless to say nearly got him killed but he lucked
out since Hinata knocked him out so he couldn't provoke a fight
with anyone. Then a silver haired leaf genin walked up and asked "Hey
this is your first time here right?" Sarios replied "Yeah why do
you ask" The silver haired genin smiled and said "Well first off
my name is Kabuto and I wanted to check since I didn't have any
info on you, you or you" he said pointing at Naruto, Shadow, and
Sarios. The three of them smiled "Don't expect to get any info
either since we were ordered to hold back so any info you do get will
be false so don't bother asking us a damn thing…also I would stop
consorting with snakes if I were you since you reek of them AND a
certain friend of mine hates snakes with a passion only surpassed by
the Kyuubi" Sarios warned him. Then Gaara, Kankuro, and Temari all
walked in saw Sarios, Naruto, and Shadow and walked over to them
<B>(also Sarios knows Gaara and the sand siblings since his family
passed through Suna a few months before they came to Konoha)</B></P><P>"Hey
Sarios haven't seen you in years" Kankuro said "yeah well we
moved here so I could become a shinobi of the leaf village also I
have the seven tailed bijuu inside of me…hey Gaara how is the
Shukaku (sp?) doing?" Sarios asked. "Naomi is doing well although
she wishes she could get out and spend some time with me in person
instead of just being in my head…" Gaara replied "…well there
is a way let me show you if we have time after this part of the
exam…oh and these two standing next to me are jinchuuriki just like
you and me but Naruto who is on my right has the Kyuubi no Kitsune
and Shadow who is on my left has the Hachibi no Ookami and I have the
Shichibi no Doragon." Sarios said while Temari drooled slightly at
the sight of Naruto since him and shadow both had toned chests and
muscles but she only has eyes for Naruto who was oblivious to her
stares.</P><P><B>Ok Ok
I know horrible place to stop but I got tired and decided to post
this just the way it is…also next chapter will be fun and if you
want a list of the pairing so far just ask and I'll PM it to you
till next time!</B></P>
</div>
<br><br><h3>Chapter 8</h3><hr><br><P><B>OK now for chapter 7 HOORAAAYYY!!! Now if you have ANY questions
then either PM them to me or leave them in your review and I will be
happy to answer as best I can now good day…and there may be some
new faces soon so YAY!!!! Also at the end of this chapter I will
post all known pairing in this fic so far…and a couple of others
that I don't care if you know about and 2 I think are funny as hell
so on with the story before Seria kills me</B></P><P>"Hey Temari … Your
drooling…" Gaara told her.</P><P>"Huh oh sorry about
that" She said with a slight blush.</P><P>"So you hold the
Shichibi no Doragon Sarios?" Kankuro asked.</P><P>"Yeah and I'm
beginning to think all of the Bijuus are female"</P><P>"<I>Only eight of us
are"</I></P><P>"<I>Then which one
isn't female Aoi-chan?"</I></P><P>"<I>The turtle of
course"</I></P><P>"…<I>and which one
is the turtle?"</I></P><P>"<I>The three tailed"</I></P><P>"<I>Oh ok thanks
Aoi-chan"</I></P><P>"<I>Any time
Sarios-kun"</I></P><P>"Aoikaen tells me
that the three tailed male is male so there are only eight female
Bijuus."</P><P>"Well I'm not
complaining Sarios are you?" Gaara asked.</P><P>"Hell no I love
Aoikaen and nothing will ever change that!" Sarios told him.</P><P>"ALL RIGHT QUIET DOWN
NOW!!!" a Jounin who had just walked into the room yelled "I am
Ibiki Morino and I will be your proctor through the written portion
of this exam. Now let me explain the rules in a language you will
understand.</P><P>NO CHEATING if you
cheat and we catch you, we will deduct three points from your teams
overall score so if you get caught three times you fail.</P><P>You have a 45
minute limit and there are ten questions so that gives you 45
minutes for nine problems and after the 45 minutes are up I will
give you the tenth now any questions?"</P><P>Silence greeted Ibiki's
words and he smiled slightly "Now here are your papers and pencils
annnnd BEGIN!" he said. And all of the genin grabbed their papers
and pencils and started writing. Gaara used his third eye to spy on
others for answers while Shadow, Naruto, and Sarios just asked their
respective tenets for answers. Ibiki noticed this and smiled a little
knowing what they were doing but since it technically wasn't
cheating he let it slide and he liked them more than the others. He
noticed that one of the chuunin had noticed and was about to throw a
kunai at Naruto but Ibiki sent him a glare that promised pain and
lots of it if he threw it so the chuunin threw it at the genin behind
Naruto and disqualified him. The genin's team left and Naruto
didn't even notice the kunai and kept writing down the answers as
Hitomi told them to him. After a few minutes Naruto, Shadow, and
Sarios were asleep on their desks since they had finished and didn't
care if their friends copied off of them. After ten more minutes
Ibiki called for every to stop.</P><P>"Alright you punks
times up now for the last question. There are two rules for this 1.
If you fail this question you never get to be a chuunin EVER. 2. If
you leave right now you can take this test again in six months. Now
you have five minutes to decide if you want to risk it."</P><P>Within those five
minutes six teams left, leaving 20 left. Naruto, Shadow, and Sarios
were still asleep causing Ibiki to sweatdrop and continue seeing as
no other teams were going to drop out.</P><P>"Allright for those
who stayed… YOU ALL PASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" he yelled with a big ass
smile on his face. Everyone except Naruto, Shadow, and Sarios who
woke up when Ibiki yelled.</P><P>"What did we miss?"
Naruto asked causing everyone in the room to sweatdrop. Then a huge
crash was heard as a giant black ball slammed through the wall
exploded, sending confetti everywhere. Standing in the middle of the
smoke was a Kunoichi(SP?). When the smoke cleared the identity of
said kunoichi was revealed and it made Sarios, Naruto, and Shadow
pale while other genin looked on in interest since they didn't know
who she was.</P><P>"This is either
really bad or really good…" Sarios said.</P><P>"ALRIGHT!! You all
lucked out since the actual proctor Anko Mitarashi got sick earlier
this week and will be unable to tor-er test you for this part of the
exam now most of you don't know me so let me introduce myself. My
name is Haku Momochi. And I will be your proctor for the second exam
now everyone to training grounds 44 and if you don't know the way
follow a Konoha team. HOP TO IT!!!!!!!!!" she ordered before she
shushined in a spiral of heart shaped snowflakes.</P><P>"Guess we better get
going… man she is scary"</P><P>"Agreed"</P><P><B>(Ten Minutes Later)</B></P><P>"ALRIGHT this is the
survival portion of the exam. But first I need you all to sign these
waivers since if you die we don't want to be responsible if one of
you gets killed by all the giant man-eating animals that reside in
this forest or by another team. If you do not sign you are
disqualified and must leave. Now once you sign these waivers go over
there to the booth and exchange them for a scroll. Now there are two
scrolls, Heaven and Earth. You must have both before you enter the
tower in the middle of the forest, also you only have FIVE days to
complete this. Now go get your scrolls" Haku explained.</P><P>Within a few minutes everyone had there scrolls and were waiting at
the gates of the forest. Three minutes later Haku let off and
explosive kunai in the air signaling the start of the second exam.</P><P><B>Ok my ideas are
running low so I'm just gonna end it here. I am so disappointed in
myself that I couldn't write any more… well review please…</B></P>
