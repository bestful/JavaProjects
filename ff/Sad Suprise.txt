peacefully, when all of a sudden he sat up clutching his stomach as
blinding white pain shot throughout his body.</p><p>His eyes clenched shut
and he grits his teeth together to keep form screaming out in pain.</p><p>Naruto felt as if his body was on fire,
when all of a sudden it just stopped.</p><p>The blond let out a breath of
relief, he had never been so happy before.</p><p>But his relief was short
lived when all of a sudden his room was flooded with red light.</p><p>The light was so bright; he was forced
to shut his eyes.</p><p>When he finally reopened his eyes he was shocked,
in front of him stood the most beautiful woman ever.</p><p>She had the perfect curves, not to big
but defiantly not to small.</p><p>She had stunning flaming red hair.</p><p>Her
hair was straight, shiny and amazingly silky looking.</p><p>Her height was
perfect as well, she was 5"5'. Short, but not to short, she was
just the perfect height. (A/N: No offence to taller or shorter people
I just personally think that would be the perfect height for a women.
I myself am 5ft 6in. So I'm not trying to be offensive.)</p><p>All in all she was gorgeous.</p><p>To top it
all off the only thing covering her was her long hair.</p><p>"Naruto-kun," she exclaimed! She
looked utterly ecstatic to see him.</p><p>"Do I know you," Naruto asked?</p><p>Now
not only stunned but confused too.</p><p>"I'm hurt Naru-Kun, how could you
forget me? I've been with you forever. I even saved you a few
times. Like when that <i>Uchiha</i> tried to kill you TWICE. And many
other times like when this despicable village tried to kill you, over
and over aging."</p><p>A look of realization flooded over
Naruto's face, before he jumped onto the woman.</p><p>"Kyuu-chan! I'm
so happy I actually got to meet you; I never really thought I would.
I know you said it would but I always doubted it. But now, I mean wow
you look great! How have you been? Why couldn't I contact you all
week? Are-"</p><p>Naruto wasn't given a chance to
finish as Kyuubi cut him off, "Naruto I want to tell you something.
I love you. I have ever since I first really met you. I don't have
much longer, after this week I will be gone forever, its how the seal
was meant to work.'</p><p>Naruto's earlier happy expression was
changed to depress.</p><p>He loved her as much if not more than she loved
him.</p><p>If she left him he didn't know what he would do.</p><p>"K- Kyuu-chan, please tell me it's
not true and you are just playing some joke on me. I love you so much
if you leave me I'll die. I can't live with out you." Naruto
said as tears began to slip through his eyes.</p><p>"Oh Naruto don't cry you're
strong you will go on, you can find someone else to love. It would
be selfish of you to take yourself away from all those that love
you."</p><p>Kyuubi looked at the love of her life
sadly, she wouldn't have minded Naruto leaving with her but she
wanted to give him a chance to live happy.</p><p>Naruto looked at her sadly, he knew
what he was going to do and he wasn't planning on changing his
mind.</p><p>"Naruto I know what you are thinking
and don't you dare, I love you to much to allow you to do this so
just get this idea out of your head."</p><p>"I'm sorry but it's not going to
happen but let's make this last week the best ever. I'll leave a
letter for all my friends. I know they will understand, I think they
might already suspect, I was considering it when I lost contact with
you, but now I can at least have this time with you so let's make
the best out of it."</p><p>Kyuubi accepted this, not willingly but
it wasn't as if she had a different choice.</p><p>And he was right at
least they had this time together.</p><p>A week later Sasuke went down to
Naruto's house to tell him to go see the Hokage about a mission.</p><p>That's when he found the formally bright and lively blond.</p><p>He had
slit his throat and as saddened as Sasuke was by this, the smile on
Naruto's face assured him that he didn't kill him self from
depression and there was nothing he could have ever done to prevent
it.</p>
