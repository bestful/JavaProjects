Hell. It was all he knew.</p><p>Everyone around him hated him. Everyone around him beat him. He was alone. He didn't know why he was alone, or why everyone hated him or why they all wanted to kill him, but he knew that he couldn't keep running forever. The pain, loneliness, and sadness that was his entire life, it was too much to bear, but yet, he still ran.</p><p>Ran from the mobs screaming 'Kill the Demon!' and 'Die Brat!'. Ran from the hate directed at him. He ran for his life.</p><p>Turning a corner, he tried heading towards the one place he knew they wouldn't follow. The large forest that looked like it would kill you. Though as he turned the corner, he tripped over a small rock and landed face first on the ground. As he tried to push himself up, he felt pain in one of his arms and realized he'd been stabbed. That was it, he'd been caught. He knew what was coming and he knew that there was nothing that he would be able to do about it.</p><p>He turned around, back against the ground, staring at the mob in front of him. He knew the looks that they had in their eyes. It was almost the look predators get when they, after a long hunt, finally caught their prey. The only difference was the hate in their eyes.</p><p>As the first fist came down, he closed his eyes in pain, trying to cover his vital points scrunching himself up on the ground as punch after punch, kick after kick, cut after cut, came at him. He'd grown used to the beating but usually the masked ANBU stopped the people from getting this far. Suddenly a blade came down into his side and he blacked out.</p><p>He quickly tried to open his eyes again and look around but felt so weak that it took him quite a bit of effort to even open his eyes. After numerous attempts he finally had managed to succeed but only ended up seeing one thing.</p><p>Red Hair, it was the only thing he saw. A bright red with orange highlights. He realized it had to be a person. Hoping and praying to Kami that he'd be able to run away again, he slowly tried to stand but no matter how much he tried, he just couldn't muster the energy. He knew that was it but he just couldn't run anymore, hell, he couldn't even stand. Closing his eyes, he just laid there with an accepting smile.</p><p><i>'Guess that's it. Too bad it'll make Jiji sad, but maybe it's better this way. They might be right anyway. Maybe I really am a demon, a monster...'</i> He thought. A lone tear slid down the side of his face.</p><p>Sensing someone, the bright red and orange haired person turned around and bent down in front of the boy in front of her. It was the first time she saw him in person, but she knew exactly who he was. Wiping the tear off his cheek she looked at him with a sad smile. She could sense his confusion and just continued smiling at the boy.</p><p>The boy could feel the kindness radiating off the person and the soft finger against his cheek. He'd never felt anything like it before and it brought him to tears. He only wished he had the energy to open his eyes again to look at her again. Her finger was so soft against his skin and felt so nice. Then suddenly the finger was lifted off his face and he missed the calming, tranquil, and completed feeling it gave him. Hoping that the person wouldn't leave him alone, hoping he'd finally have someone who would care for him, he put everything he could into opening his eyes and finally succeeded.</p><p>The sight that met his now tearing eyes would be ingrained in his mind for years to come. The kind expression, the sad smile, the warm eyes, everything about the person in front of him, he would remember for the rest of his life. The last of his energy now gone, his eyes slowly closed and he knew he was falling into unconsciousness.</p><p>The next words he heard from her would forever be ingrained into both his heart and mind.</p><p>"Live, Naruto. If not for yourself, then for those precious to you. Live." She said as she saw him blacking out, hoping to give him at least one last memory of herself. Hoping that he wouldn't forget her. Though most importantly, she said it because she didn't want to lose the only person that she might ever truly become close too. The only precious person she might ever have.</p><p>Slowly waking up, he could feel something soft under him. Opening his eyes, hoping to see the girl again, he saw that he was no longer in the dark place he had met her. The white ceiling could only mean one thing. He was in a hospital. Sitting up he saw that the only other people in the room were two ANBU ninja and the Sandaime Hokage, Sarutobi Hiruzen, his surrogate grandfather, his 'Jiji'. The Hokage, seeing him now awake and healed up, shot him a warm smile. With a quick look he silently ordered the ANBU out of the room.</p><p>"Hey, Jiji, where is the girl?" Naruto asked, curious for her whereabouts and hoping that she wouldn't leave him alone. The touch of sadness in his voice however wasn't missed by the old man in front of him.</p><p>"What do you mean, Naruto? There was never any girl near you." The Hokage answered, somewhat confused as he'd stayed at Naruto's side since he had found the boy bleeding on the street. His voice carried a touch of sadness though, hoping that Naruto hadn't dreamed up a friend in his desperation for friendship. "Are you sure that you didn't just have a dream?"</p><p>"Oh... ok." He replied, however it was obvious that he was extremely sad over it. "Then I'll go back to my apartment now. I'll see ya, Jiji." He got up and began slowly walking out the door when he stopped and turned around looking up at his grandfather figure. "If you see a girl with red and orange hair... Tell her that I said thank you." He said and waited for the Hokage's response with a resolute face that he'd never worn before.</p><p>"I will Naruto, but I'm afraid that I have no knowledge of a girl like that in Konoha." replied the Hokage with a grandfatherly smile. At this Naruto was given a slight bit of hope for a reason unknown to the old man and ran off out the door.</p><p>Running through the village using all the shortcuts he knew to avoid the villagers, he thought back on the girl that he'd seen. He knew he'd see her again, he didn't know what told him that, but the second he asked the question to the old man, he felt like that while she wasn't in the village, she was watching over him and knew he'd meet her again. He may have only been five at the time, but he was smart for his age, at least when he wanted to be and knew that whoever she was, from the look on her face at that moment, he knew she cared for him.</p><p>With a resolute nod as he ran under a broken gate, he decided that no matter what he would do, the words she told him would be the words he'd follow for the rest of his life. He had a reason to fight now. He had a reason to run now.</p><p>He had a reason to live for now.</p><p>He'd live for those precious to him. He'd live for her.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>- Seven Years Later -</b></p><p>Naruto walked out of his small apartment with a confident look on his face. It'd been seven years since he'd seen the girl that changed his life. It was also the day of the graduation exams for the Ninja Academy. And finally, it would be the day that he finally found out what was sealed inside him. He had quite the day ahead of him.</p><p>He headed towards the academy thinking about how his life had changed in the past years. After that day, he began to train himself. He couldn't fail her. He would live. The people of Konoha wouldn't ever get the chance to beat him like they did that day ever again. He made sure of it.</p><p>He was wearing his usual Orange Jumpsuit for appearances as he had for the past seven years. It ended up being the perfect cover up. The jumpsuit had been baggy enough to hide is true fitness and had been bright and outlandish enough to make people think he was an idiot. They thought he was weak and stupid and he was happy about that. He couldn't, after all, let people know his true skills. By doing that he was giving people an edge and the ability to prepare to prevent him from using some of his abilities. He wouldn't give anyone the chance to get him. He still had to see her again and knew she'd be proud when she saw him again.</p><p>He hadn't spent the past seven years doing nothing. He started his training back then doing what he could and slowly built things up from there. Of course, from time to time he would 'borrow' some resources from the Hokage's library to help him learn but he would always bring back what he took. After about two years, he began to broaden his horizons. He didn't stop his physical training, but he did add in chakra exercises and began to study Fuinjutsu. His sealing skills were already top notch and using his various henged appearances, he sold them to various stores for money to have saved and to use on top of the monthly allowance the Hokage gave him.</p><p>His skills branched even farther out from there however. His Taijutsu, being the main part of his training, was his best skill. He was fast and he knew it. Even with the insane resistance seals the he put on himself, he still could outrun and trick most ANBU out of battle, the only ones ever being able to catch him without being serious being the silver haired one and the brown haired one. He could probably beat most chunin in a spar as well, but he kept that fact hidden. Thankfully Mizuki, one of the academy instructors, couldn't see the instinctual habits he gained from his training during his spars.</p><p>Genjutsu and Ninjutsu however, where the two points in which he was lacking. He could easily dispel most Genjutsu but his vast chakra reserves made it difficult to learn. That didn't mean he didn't try, but he just wasn't very good at it yet. Ninjutsu on the other hand was incredibly easy for him to learn, he just hadn't gotten a piece of chakra paper till only about a year ago so he just hadn't had the time to study it yet. He did however have a good few C and D rank Wind, Water, and Lightning element jutsu under his belt. They would surely help him in the future and sooner he learned higher rank Ninjutsu, the better.</p><p>Arriving at the academy early, for the first time in a long time, he took to sitting on his favorite swing to watch all the families drop off their children. Even if he didn't have anyone besides three or four people in the village, it didn't mean that it didn't make him smile watching the various parents worrying over their children.</p><p>Getting up off his swing after fifteen minutes or so, he walked into the loud academy room for his class and graduation exam. Sitting down at the back next to a shy girl that always took glances at him named Hinata Hyuga and a loud mouthed idiot with a dog on his head named Kiba Inuzuka. He didn't want any of the trouble he usually got and needed to take things seriously today. He decided to put his head down on his desk and pretend to sleep while he waiting for class to start.</p><p>Once his senseis got into the room, he slowly picked his head up and lazily paid attention as his favorite sensei, Umino Iruka, began speaking, although since it was the usual boring motivational speech he began to tune it out once more.</p><p>Once the entire speech was finished, Iruka and Mizuki began to pass out the exams. The first part of the exam was a written test. Mizuki had of course made sure to start at the back and give Naruto his test first. What nobody saw, except Naruto that is, was that Mizuki put a Genjutsu on his paper to change what the questions actually were to Chunin and Jounin level questions that he shouldn't know the answers to. There where two problems with Mizuki's plan. One was that he easily dispelled the genjutsu, to Mizuki's surprise, and two, he knew the answers to the questions Mizuki put on there anyway.</p><p>As he quickly finished the test, he put his head down and waited for everyone else to finish and hand in their papers before he did the same with his. After that Naruto followed the rest of the class out doors for the second part of the exam. The Taijutsu spars. He'd been wondering if he should let loose at this point just to pummel Mizuki in the ground for trying to sabotage him again. <i>'I guess I'll just go easy on him but give him a few bruises to remember.'</i></p><p>As each name was called, he paid attention to the few fights that were worth watching. He saw that most of the clan heirs were finally taking things seriously and not hiding their abilities as they did during the year trying to beat the chunin, but surprisingly, Mizuki had enough skill to beat all of them other than Hinata. This was a surprise as she was considered shy and weak. Apparently she was more than she appeared the be, much like himself. <i>'I'll be sure to keep an eye on her'</i> He thought, hoping that she'd make a good ally.</p><p>Another notable match had been the one right before his. The match of Uchiha Sasuke, the last Uchiha. He was talented, that was true, but he had too much anger and hate in him. It was blinding him of the world around him and was the reason he lost. He was arrogant, hateful and thought he was the best. The three flaws that would prove him weak and Naruto knew it.</p><p>"Uzumaki Naruto, your up." Iruka called out.</p><p>Naruto walked up to the training field and decided to reveal some of his abilities. He formed a ram seal and gathered his chakra towards his seals.</p><p>"Kai!" He called out, to everyone's surprise. Everyone knew about seals but to be able to use them, was a surprise to everyone. He payed attention as smoke accumulated around him as both his storage seals let go of their contents as well as his resistance seals releasing. Once the smoke cleared, everyone's jaw dropped.</p><p>There was Naruto, but he looked like a completely different person. He was wearing the same outfit the Yondaime Hokage wore. The exact same outfit. It wasn't just a replica, it was actually the same outfit that the Yondaime wore. But that wasn't the only thing that made people's jaws drop. It was the fact that with the outfit on and a serious look on his face, he looked exactly like the Yondaime. It was as if he was once again standing there, in the flesh, only a bit younger.</p><p>Around him, were the scraps left from his old jumpsuit burned off. He purposely put seals on the inside of it that would burn it off when he let it go but wouldn't burn anything under it. The effect was quite cool in his opinion, as the ashes around him blew in the air creating an interesting whirlwind.</p><p>"You going to start it Iruka sensei?" Naruto said to bring everyone out of their stupor.</p><p>"H-Hai Naruto." Iruka said. "Begin!"</p><p>Immediately Naruto got into his stance. It wasn't the academy stance either, it was his own personal stance he developed along with his personal style over the past years. Seeing that he wasn't going to be charging in as usual, Mizuki started the fight.</p><p>Throwing the first punch, Mizuki made his first mistake. He didn't know what his opponent was capable of.</p><p>In a burst of speed Naruto appeared next to Mizuki and gave a powerful kick to his 'sensei's' side, sending the man flying straight into a tree. Naruto made sure to hold back a little with that kick because he didn't want everyone to know his true strength but it was more then enough to stop the man from getting up any time soon.</p><p>Walking towards the group that was looking him with mouths agape, he sent a grin towards Iruka, telling him that he had planned the whole thing. The look on Iruka's face was priceless and he burst out laughing thinking about how Naruto had tricked them all. Even the Hokage.</p><p>Iruka walked off the with class in tow and began the next and final part of the test. The Academy Ninjutsu test. Usually it was done indoors but this time they decided to do it outdoors due to Naruto's request that he both go first and do it in an area with a lot of room.</p><p>"Ok, Naruto. I don't know what you have planned but we'll let you try. Remember, you need to create at least two clones of yourself, henge yourself, and substitute yourself with something."</p><p>First he got the two easy jutsu aside, henging himself into the third Hokage and then substituted himself with one of the other civilian students that had failed the written exam. Then cam the fun part.</p><p>Forming his fingers into a ram seal, he once against called out "Kai!" and let go one of his ten chakra suppression seals. Feeling the strength flow through him, he began.</p><p>"Kage Bunshin no Jutsu." He whispered quietly so no one else would hear the name of the jutsu and next to him popped up a single shadow clone. It was difficult not to accidentally make more with how much chakra he had, even with the suppression seals but he managed. Nodding to his clone, the clone put his hands into a ram seal and called out "Bunshin no Jutsu!" he called out and around him popped up more than thirty clones, standing straight and perfect, much to the surprise of everyone.</p><p>"Now you know why I needed the extra room, Iruka Sensei." Naruto said with a smirk.</p><p>Once again getting out of his daze, Iruka handed Naruto his headband and began to call up the other students.</p><p>Walking out of the building, he smiled as he headed off to celebrate his graduation. Even if the entire thing was a joke to him, it was nice to finally be able to act like himself. No longer bound by civilian laws or the civilian council. He still would make sure to keep his skills hidden but he wouldn't need to hide his personality anymore, his true self was finally free.</p><p>Taking the roofs to his favorite food stand, Ichiraku Ramen, he arrived within a few minutes and without any of the distractions walking along the streets would normally provide. He took a seat a called for his favorite ramen chef and sister figure, Ichiraku Ayame.</p><p>"Hey, Ayame-nee-chan, Miss me?" Naruto called out as he sat down.</p><p>"Hey Naruto! The usual?" she called back without even turning from the ramen she was currently preparing.</p><p>"Yeah sure, but add another two bowls of miso, I'm in a good mood."</p><p>"Got it, so tell me, did you gra... du..." she said as she began to turn around only to be completely taken aback from the appearance of her surrogate brother. "What happened Naruto, what's with the new getup?" she asked, still no completely believing that the Naruto in front of her was her Naruto.</p><p>"Well... now that I'm a ninja... I thought I'd dress and act like one. Hehe..." he said while scratching the back of his head sheepishly.</p><p><i>'Some things just never change.' s</i>he thought as she observed his actions. "Well, you certainly do look like one now, but don't go thinking that your all grown up just because your a ninja now." she said as she leaned over the counter to ruffle his hair a bit.</p><p>"Wait, a ninja now? Seriously?" A voice called from the back of the shack, which turned out to be the owner of the shack, Ichiraku Teuchi. "Congratulations, Naruto! It's about time you became a ninja! Especially after missing the past two exams, although that wasn't exactly your fault..." he finished off with a bit of a scowl, remembering how the villagers stopped Naruto from actually even taking the exams. He just didn't know Naruto made sure to pass through the most populated districts those two days to make sure he graduated with the 'most talented' class in years.</p><p>"Don't worry about it Teuchi-san. Let's keep our thoughts on the ramen! It's a great day after all!" Naruto cheerfully replied.</p><p>"Here you go the Naruto, just don't eat too fast this time." Ayame told him as she passed him the bowl which he took with pleasure. Within twenty minutes, he'd gone through eight large bowls and was on his ninth and final bowl.</p><p>"Ahhhhh, that was great! Thanks Teuchi-san, Ayame-nee-chan! I've gotta run now. Gotta do a few more things before the day is out! I'll see both of you soon!" He said as he got up and ran to his apartment to get his sealing supplies so he could set-up the seals he needed before sundown.</p><p>About two hours later, once he had set up all the needed seals in the clearing he found right outside of the village. From the restrainment seals in case whatever was inside him would lose control to the forced mindscape entrance seals, everything was set up and ready.</p><p>It was impossible to enter a mindscape willingly without years of meditation, meaning the only way he could do it was through seals to force him into it or to injure himself to the point where he could die, which he preferred to avoid. He didn't find the idea of having a chance to meet the Shinigami any time soon.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he sat down in the middle of all the seals and began to channel his chakra around him. Slowly he felt his senses dulled and soon he found himself in a sewer like hallway.</p><p><i>'Damn, my mind looks terrible. If this is what people look like on the inside then now I know why people rarely use their mindscapes. Although since this is technically my mind I should be able to control things in here...'</i> He thought, curious as it was the first time he ever was in his mindscape to his memory.</p><p>Concentrating his thoughts, he slowly turned the hallways into a smooth tan wall and the floor into a nice wooden floor with the ceiling being a rough surface similar to the walls. The only odd thing was that the pipes around him were still there, only more organized and cleaner now.</p><p>Heading down the hallway he finally came towards what he was looking for, but what he saw was the one thing that he never expected.</p><p>Leaning against the giant iron bars of a jail... was <i>her.</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>A/N:</b> Well guys, here is the first chapter of A Few Words.

<br><br><h3>Chapter 2</h3><hr><br><p style="text-align:center;"><b>A Few Words</b></p><p style="text-align:center;"><u>by Ourania Aella</u></p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>Chapter 2 â€“ Coming Clean</b></p><p style="text-align:center;">Posted â€“ 3/18/2012</p><hr size=1 noshade><p>He'd been prepared for anything. He'd taken all the precautions he could, but it still wasn't enough. Nothing could have prepared him for what he was looking at.</p><p>Everything he knew was just turned on it's head.</p><p>She was here, she was there right in front of him. He wanted to run and hug her, but he couldn't. The one person he looked forward to seeing again, was not who he thought they were. She had nine tails. There was only one being in existence that had that many tails. The Kyuubi no Kitsune. The being that rampaged his village that fateful day twelve years prior.</p><p>Then everything clicked. He was a Jinchuuriki. That was why he was hated. The Fourth Hokage didn't defeat the Kyuubi. He sealed inside a newborn child. Him. He now understood it all.</p><p>It all came down to one thing. A question.</p><p>Was the young woman in front of him right now, the Kyuubi herself, the one who showed him kindness all those years ago? Was she the one who gave him hope, gave him a reason to live? Did he still think of the person in front of him the same way now that he knew she was the Kyuubi?</p><p>Apparently, the fact that the Kyuubi no Kitsune was a girl didn't even come to mind.</p><p>After a couple moments, he came to a decision, and tentatively started to walk up to her.</p><p>Once he was a few steps away, he stopped, looked up at her and saw her smiling at him kindly.</p><p>One moment he was just standing there, the next he was on top of her, both of them laying on the floor, sobbing and hugging her as if she would go away. As if this was the last time he would ever see her again.</p><p>As they let themselves revel in each other's warmth, an unsaid agreement was met that they'd leave all the important details that needed to be explained for next time. For now, it was just two people meeting each other again after seven years apart. It wasn't the time to speak to each other about any heavy topics or ask for answers. That could wait till the next time they met. For now, they were just happy to have the other back again, one because he'd been waiting to see her again for the past seven years, and the other because she'd been hoping that this moment would come for so long.</p><p>After a while, he stood up and pulled her up into a hug and said "I'll be back soon." Letting her go, he took a step back and walked up to the seal, and ripped half of it off the metal bars. Once the act was done, he slowly began fading from view, drifting back to reality.</p><p>However, as he was fading from his mindscape, one of his alarm seals tripped and alerted him to the presence of an intruder in his barrier. He could only hope he'd make it in time to get away.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>- Elsewhere -</b></p><p>Mizuki was currently running away from the village, and thanks to the connections he had with the council, he'd been able to time everything so well that the Hokage wouldn't even find out that he or the scroll were gone for another ten minutes at the least. Thank god for council meetings and schedules, as without the knowledge of both, he wouldn't have been able to get the Scroll of Sealing.</p><p>Hiding behind a building near the village gates, he quickly looked to see if the guards were awake or asleep. Lucky for him, one was and the other was already dozing off. Deciding to use a quick genjutsu to hide his presence, he did so and ran out of the village before anyone would see him. Using the village gates was one of the riskier parts of his plan, but ANBU would most likely first check the emergency tunnels before getting a tracker.</p><p>The only leads he'd left behind of him being the perpetrator of the crime were the missed teacher's meeting that he couldn't attend to prepare for the crime, and the fact that his apartment was bare of any important belongings as if he'd planned to leave. If either Iruka or the ANBU figured out either of the two, he'd be caught in no time.</p><p>Running off the main path out of the village, he came across something that caught his attention. Sparing a moment to check it out, he grinned at his luck.</p><p>What he found was a seal on a tree hiding a clearing, and once he stepped into the seal's affected area, he saw the one thing he hated, Naruto Uzumaki, the Demon, the Kyuubi no Yoko. His luck just couldn't get any better, a chance to get rid of the demon and stealing the Scroll of Sealing!</p><p>Slowly removing the seals of the trees around the clearing to allow him entry, he watched as the barrier dissipated and his target was open to assault. Slowly sneaking up to his target, he was startled as the demon's eyes opened and looked straight at him. Rushing, he just missed his target as the demon jumped away after making a quick handsign and muttering some sort of suiton jutsu.</p><p>Naruto, seeing the threat, quickly did a handsign and muttered "Suiton: Asastsuyu no Jutsu" to dampen the ground around Mizuki and jumped away.</p><p>"Ha! I can't believe my luck today, I can take down the Demon and steal the scroll!" Mizuki shouted while preparing a giant shuriken that he held on his back.</p><p>"You know, since I'm a ninja now, I can't let you leave, Mizuki? It was a mistake to get near me. Especially since you just ruined my good mood." Naruto growled. He really was in a good mood and didn't really want to get into a fight.</p><p>"Ha! You don't even know why the villagers hate you, demon! Don't you want to know why? Don't want to know why they glare are you? Why they despise your very existence?" He could tell Mizuki was trying to lead him on to get him angry or scared, so he could have an easier time to defeat him. Sadly for Mizuki, he'd come just a few minutes too late for such a declaration to affect him. Now that he knew who was inside him, he'd never be bothered by it again.</p><p><i>'Might as well play along for now. I already know I'm a Jinchuuriki. Maybe I can use this to my advantage.'</i> He thought as he let a sad smile grace his lips at the thought of her. "Why? Why do those bastards hate me?" He growled out. Trying to act angry and desperate. Thankfully, Mizuki bought it.</p><p>"You know how the Yondaime beat the Kyuubi no Yoko? It's all a lie! He sealed it! The Sandaime just made a law so we couldn't tell anyone! He sealed it in you, demon!" and with that he jumped to the ground and threw the giant shuriken. What he didn't realize was that the ground was wet and slippery now thanks to Naruto's jutsu and upon landing he slipped slightly, so when Naruto dodged the shuriken, he was completely unprepared for Naruto's counterattack.</p><p>With quick kick, he caught the off guard chunnin and sent him backwards into the tree behind him giving him enough time to get the giant shuriken and throw it back at the head of the currently stunned man. Sadly, the man caught his bearing in time and narrowly dodged the giant projectile that had lodged itself in the tree just where his head just was.</p><p>"Damn you, demon!" he called out, sending a barrage of kunai at Naruto. Naruto however expected it and dodged while sending his own barrage nicking the chunnin's face. Thankfully this gave enough of a distraction to let him hide behind a tree and make three quick shadow clones silently and send them in a triangle formation towards the chunnin.</p><p>"You think you'll get me with two clones! Hah!" Mizuki shouted completely oblivious to the fact that the clones were luring him to the place where the real Naruto was hiding and that the real Naruto wasn't actually there. This ended up being his downfall as he suddenly was caught from behind with a kunai at his neck.</p><p>"You know, Mizuki? If I hadn't known about the Kyuubi, you might have actually gotten me, but thanks for the information about Jiji's law. Looks like I have some more things to talk to him about." Naruto said with a smirk, and with that he hit Mizuki in the back of neck, knocking him unconscious and headed back to the village.</p><p style="text-align:center;"><b>- Hokage's Office -</b></p><p>Hiruzen was getting nervous. Someone had gotten into his office and had stolen the Scroll of Sealing from right under his ANBU's noses. That meant one of two things, one being that it was and inside job and that someone leaked some information, or that they needed to revise the security in the tower. It was an extremely bad situation and he could only hope that they caught the perpetrator in time.</p><p>He'd just called three ANBU squads and sent them to search the secret passage ways and another squad to check with the guards at each of the gates. If they turned up empty handed, then he'd have to get an investigation started and by then, the person who stole the scroll would most likely be long gone. That just wasn't an option.</p><p>He was trying to think of anyone that would be a flight risk or anyone that was missing from any meetings. Then suddenly, it clicked. Mizuki wasn't at the Teacher's meeting, saying he was getting something checked after he was beaten by one of the genin and he also was one of the library guards prior to him taking up teaching at the academy. He wasn't there! That meant he had a lead, now to investigate it.</p><p>"Boar! Get me Umino Iruka!" He called out as an ANBU guard hidden in the room appeared and disappeared once the command was given.</p><p>Within a minute, a panting Iruka ran through the doors wondering what was so urgent that he needed to be at the Hokage's office immediately.</p><p>"What's going on Hokage-sama?" he asked through his ragged breathing. Normally such a run would mean nothing to him, but after a full day of testing genin and his training that he was in the middle of, he was already very tired.</p><p>"Do you know where Mizuki is?" Hiruzen asked, grandfatherly and kind voice gone. In front of Iruka was the strongest ninja in Konohagakure, Sarutobi Hiruzen, The Professor, the hokage.</p><p>"No, Hokage-sama! He should be at home recovering after being defeated by Naruto during the taijutsu spar. He'd been knocked unconscious after Naruto showed his true skill during the exam." Iruka said, instantly alert, although he smiled when he mentioned the last part, obviously proud of his favorite student.</p><p>The Hokage smiled at that as well, his surrogate grandson had fooled almost everyone except him, mostly because he knew where some of the scrolls Naruto was using came from. His family home and the Hokage Library. After all, very few places have scrolls on advanced sealing and such a variety of jutsu. Too bad he didn't exactly have the time to reminisce with Iruka about Naruto's developments and talents.</p><p>"Boar! Check Mizuki's apartment and report back in five minutes! Take a squad of trackers along and have them find him! Iruka, I want you to search for him and bring the scroll back, that's your main goal. Bringing Mizuki back isn't the priority here." He could worry about Naruto later, Mizuki was the priority.</p><p>However, before Iruka could actually leave, a voice called out from behind them. The same voice that made two of the shinobi in the room jump in surprise, both wondering how skilled their favorite blond truly was.</p><p>"Naruto, you really shou-" Sarutobi began, only to stop once he saw just who the blond had with him.</p><p>"You know, Jiji, you really shouldn't worry so much. You should know things will usually work themselves out for the better when it involves." Naruto called out from the doorway, wearing one of the grins he wore after he pranked someone. "I've got Mizuki and the scroll right here. He made the mistake of attacking me instead of leaving quietly." He ended with a smirk, while throwing down both Mizuki and the scroll in front of the desk.</p><p>The first thing that came to the mind of the hokage was one though. <i>'I should just have him join ANBU, shouldn't I? He's doing better than many of them are anyway.'</i></p><p>"Iruka, get him to Interrogation and Torture and explain what happened before I get a headache..." The hokage muttered. Count on Naruto to do what they couldn't in the most unpredictable manner possible. Not to mention with the clothes Naruto wore at the genin exam and the newly fitted versions of the same clothes he was wearing now, he was going to have quite the headache. "So Naruto, what can I do for you now that you've given me so much more paperwork to fill out?"</p><p>"Your lucky you already sent out the ANBU in the room on a chase for Mizuki. I didn't stop them so we could have some privacy." Sarutobi could just feel the headache getting worse already. "So, why'd you hide so much from me?" Naruto ended, adopting a semi-serious tone of voice.</p><p>"How much do you know?" The hokage asked in a defeated voice, knowing that he'd either have to spill everything or Naruto would never trust him again.</p><p>"I know enough. Like how you made a law making sure no one could tell anyone else about the Kyuubi being sealed inside me after telling the council, that would have obviously leaked such information out if you didn't do it yourself to deter any enemies from attacking the village. Though, I understand why you did these things, I don't understand why I wasn't told earlier. And from my attire, you probably already know that I've figured <i>that</i> out. So really, I just have two questions. Did my parents leave me anything after their deaths? And what will you do now that you know that I know all this?" Naruto replied, trying to keep any anger, malice, and unneeded information away from his surrogate grandfather till he knew that he wouldn't overreact.</p><p>The fact that the Kyuubi was a girl who he trusted even more than the man in front of him also was something that was best kept a secret for now. He had a few secrets other than that as well. The fact that he'd stolen the forbidden scroll and had a copy of it elsewhere along with his ripping off half the seal during his visit to his favorite tenant would also need to be kept secret.</p><p>Sarutobi on the other hand was really sweating. He could tell from Naruto's tone of voice that he wasn't speaking to your average twelve year old. The boy's eyes told him that much. Whatever Naruto had been doing the past few years had sped up his maturation to the point that he was speaking to someone with more experience then the average teenager. If he lied at this point, he might lose his surrogate grandson as well as one of his most talented ninja. As a person and as Hokage he couldn't take that risk. He had to come clean.</p><p>"Your parents didn't want me to give you their final gifts to you till you became a chunnin, but we both know that you are past that point. Go to your father home, the entrance is near the Nara compound, closer to the. On the second floor, in your parent's bedroom, there is a blood seal behind the picture of your mother the day the Yondaime became hokage. By the way, her name was Kushina Uzumaki, although you probably would have figured that out once you saw all the pictures. And to answer your second question, as your 'Jiji' I will do nothing, but as Hokage, I will need to do everything I can to make sure you stay a loyal shinobi of Konoha. As long as that happens and you do not break any laws, I won't interfere with your life." He ended with a smile. He may have had his duties as Hokage, but he was loyal to Naruto and his family first, and his village second.</p><p>"Thanks, Jiji." Naruto said with a kind smile before he started to walk out, although before he walked out the door, he stopped to ask one thing. "Is there anything else you're hiding from me, Jiji?"</p><p>"Nothing that you won't find out from what you find when you reach home, Naruto-kun. I'd just rather not be there when you find out." Sarutobi replied with a slightly nervous chuckle, truly afraid of what an angry Naruto could do. "Just stop by tomorrow after you've calmed down and I'll answer any other questions you might have.</p><p>And with that, Naruto walked out, heading to the home he should have lived in for the past twelve years. Hopefully he'd get another chance to see <i>her</i> again and get some of the answers he wasn't ready for during their last meeting.</p><p>Sadly, his tenant wasn't of the same mind and was truly afraid of his reactions to the answers she'd give.</p><p>Once again leaning against the bars of her jail, she thought one things. <i>'I hope he can me a chance after all I've done...'</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b><b>A/N:</b></b>Sorry for the wait everyone, from now on, I'll be having the dates of release for chapters up on my profile. I'm setting this story as one of my main focuses so this should be updated biweekly at worst.</p><p>This chapter is partly a filler chapter really so, next time we should be getting into things a bit more. Sorry it's shorter than I promised however. I had a longer chapter written but it just wasn't up to par, so I rewrote and came up with this.</p><p>Also, I still need a beta! So, any help would be welcome!</p>
